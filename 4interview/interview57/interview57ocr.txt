me

via
@borisjohnson
and
i've
done
my
seven
days
of
isolation,
alas
i
still
have
one
symptoms,
a
minor
symptom,
so
in
accordance
with
government
advice
must
continue
self-isolation
until
that
symptom
itself
goes.
but
we're
working
clearly,
whole
time,
our
programme
to
defeat
virus.
about
100,000
tests
per
day
by
end
month.
just
want
say
crucial
thing,
quick
thing
everybody
thinking
this
weekend,
what
may
be
some
fine
weather,
because
reckon
lot
people
will
starting
think
they'd
rather
getting
out
there,
particularly
if
they've
got
kids
household,
there
temptation
get
hang
start
break
regulations.
urge
you
not
do
that.
please,please
stick
guidance
now.

made
huge
effort,
sacrifice,
absolutely
brilliantly
well
delaying

incredible
clapping
