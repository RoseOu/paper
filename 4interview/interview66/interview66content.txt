If you look at the at the the progress and space in 1969 or able to send seven to the moon, 1969. Then we had the space shuttle that the space shuttle can only take people to lower the orbit. Then the space that are tired and the United States could take no one to over it. So that's the trend is trying is down to nothing. This is not you are mistaken when they think that technology just automatically improve it does not automatically improve it only improve if a lot of people work very hard to make it better. And actually it will, I think it by itself dig raid actually. You look at great civilization is like ancient Egypt and the will to make the permit. And they forgot how to do that. And the Rome as they bought the incredible aqua duck, they forgot how to do it. Yy u, because this is what I want. I do we need to build a city on Mars with a million people on it in your life time, which I think it's kind of what you said you love to do. Yeah, I think it's important to have um, a future that is inspiring on a feeling I mean I just think there like they have to be a reason that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Like why do you want to live? What what's the point, what what inspired to you, what what do you love about the future? And if we're not out there, if the future is not include being out there among the stars and being a multi plan of species, I find it, and that it's in depression, if that's not the future that we're going to have, r. Wait for me.
