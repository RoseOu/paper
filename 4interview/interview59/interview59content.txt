Issue and I just wanna wind back to just deal with a couple of the characters in want to wind back to the moment is one the London mail. You have the slightly strange relationship with him. What do you believe his motivation were coming into this? You're a render man, dw ot govern his decision as to which side he would be on. Look, I spoke to at length about it and I said you have never been in favor of leaving the EU so why now there is a better deal of a are you in favour of leaving now. And of course he didn't think my deal with good enough for what my conclusion is. He thought that the breaks it vote would be lost. But he didn't want to give up the chance of being on the romantic Patrick national stick, side of breath, you know the minutes before he. Goes out to explain why he is going to be on the side of it. He sent me a tax a breaks it will be crush liker under the harrow typical e, forest colorful, but I can only conclusion. But you never argue for it before he thought it was going to lose.

Right. Which is not in itself to be seized. Do you think Johnson put that on the bus knowing it was on true. I think they put it on the bus thinking is the biggest possible number. And so let's have a big argument about it. But they must have known it didn't include the re bate. It was a great figure on the net, figure it. They got on the bus and they left the truth at home and that was very impressive forest Johnson and Michael gove that you call them the ambassador is for the post truth. Well it it was that said ever state in criticism of two people who have friends of that was it was a a time when some of these things that was saying more in politics, people having their own facts that truth um became a parent there was something. That happened in the campaign, and things that.
