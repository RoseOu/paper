Yes. In fact, if you look at the fundamental basic research on molecular via rolla g, on the ability of which really comes from h itself and fund investigated to be able to identify a package on and sequence of extraordinary rapidly to allow us to do the things that I mention in a moment. But this goes back to fundamental basic research on molecular biology, biology, net etc. Remember the first car owner virus that caused the problem global e was the SARS virus in 2002, which were 8000 people in 775 death for a death rate of about nine 10%. Several years later we had the mask and of hours again causing a problem in the Middle East. Now we have the 3rd can a virus. One of the things that we've been able to do in the nhs, you know does many things and was studying very intense, the fundamental biology and pat the genesis of the disease. But the things that we're doing right now in the form of inter vention, r in the arena of valor. It's really extraordinary that from the first time the sequence was made public r. By the Chinese when they discovered would virus it was literally within days we took that sequence of the database and insert it into one of a vac scene platform is called the messenger RNA in the vac scene research center at the end. And then what we did was do a step wise approach, which is the first determine, is it in a Jenny can you stick it in an animal and would have make the moon and response? The answer is yes. We I predict that we would be about to to three months to go in to phase one trials. And I think we're going to beat that I think will be in and probably about six weeks, which as a matter of fact will be the fast that anyone ever has gone. From the identification of a sequence into a phase one trial of any vaccine seen that have been done. That's the good news, the so green news is that since vaccines are given to normal individuals, with its power MT is safety and whether or not it works. So we'll do a phase. One trial will do it in the number of our son is including ore scent a at the h that will take about three to four months. And then if successful, which I believe it will be, there is no reason to believe it won't be safe. Will go into its called the face to trial. The face one trial is 45 individuals, face to trial of hundreds of not a couple of thousand individuals. It would take them about a year to year and a half to be fully confident that we would have a vac seen that will be able to protect the American people. And so although the good news is we did it fast, the bad news is that the reality of technology means this is not going to be something that have tomorrow.
