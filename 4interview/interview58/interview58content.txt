Where what we decided is that we got a way forward for this country and for the eu now we got a great deal of br exit as you know, for the first time in 3.5 years pilot voted to in dorse away out of the EU the the deal I was able to do with our friends and partners, but unfortunately and they also voted to delay the final approval that deal with a indoor stand what that means I'm afraid is this this point is anything to go buy that they could go on for a very long time. So I'm afraid it looks as though you friends are going to respond to parliament request by having an extension. So I really don't want at all, so the way to get this done, the way to get breaks it done is I think, to be reasonable with parliament and say if they genuine want more time to study this excellent deal. They can have it. But they have to agree to a. General election on December the 12th. And that's the way forward because this part has been going on for a long time without a majority of its refuse to deliver breaks. It is impossible to deliver the destination of its time, frankly, that the opposition some and up the nerve to submit themselves to the judgment of of our collected boss, which is the people of of the UK that if your deal is so great, as you claim and if parliament you believe has in do STH in which they haven't they just agreed to to go ahead and why then try to run this through with the threat of election you could go on a more convention time table give parliament time to do standard length of screw and get on with it that way when they are going to give them the going to get that is very good point we're going to give them all the time they want between now and the solution of parliament to do that suit and that is much more than I think that that some of them have been on. Asking for I mean that's more I think the other was with this is AA big Hunk of time and there is interesting in the debate on Tuesday about breaks it. They say we need more time to study. This this deal actually the Labour Party couldn't even find enough speak as they ran out of speak of loan and new ideas to bring to the table. We've had 3.5 years to discuss this. We are being very, very reasonable, was saying, if u genuine more one more time, you can have it here it is. But the the condition for that is that we all agree to go out for a general election on December the 12 and the reason for having that that deadline is because the wise I don't think the people of this country I'm going to believe the parliament is really going to do it by that dead line, but they spent 3.5 years. Failed to do it. So let's get it done and let's come out of you.
