Tech sales are about human enhancement they really let us be out longer to go higher to be faster if we check the record the evolution of clothing is deeply interwoven with the history of exploration you know the human body was really built and created for this certain climate or the certain place but then something changed the tools was a fire or was it clothing 100 thousand years ago humans used animal skins to protect us from the cold thirty thousand years ago is when we actually cracked the code on weaving seven thousand years ago the introduction of cotton linens silks actually inspired global trade we fire up the Industrial Revolution and our outer limits are completely redefined power looms take the hands out of handy work we go north and we go south and we take flags and we plant them in the poles it's through augmenting our own skin through pushing our technologies and our developments all around garments and clothing that have taken us to the deepest depths of the ocean and onto the moon but still we can't stop and won't stop pushing look here closer smaller we see this microscopic pee-yew solution it's quickly being extracted out of this really small needle tablet two hundred thousand days all like these fire hoses shooting this fiber flies through the air hits a transfer paper it's almost like spaghetti being thrown up against the wall smack these are nano fibers with holes so small that they can trap the tiniest droplet of water even a single-celled bacteria when you get down as scales this small at the nano level things that were never possible before they become possible now it allows us to create garments in a tunable way that can be both breathable and waterproof that can really stretch and enhance what we're able to do as humans as users as athletes as people but being able to ask question what if and coming up with blue sky ideas we can create a garment that's never been made before it's this technology it's nano spinning the applications are endless a shell for Mountaineers a patch for blood vessels an antibiotic filter or even a pair of pants to self generate its own power if the history of textiles has taught us anything is that with every leap forward in technology there's an equally great leap forward in ability technology has allowed us to redefine what's humanly possible let's see what we can do next
