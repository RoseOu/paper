Voting is a privilege in this country and you need to be legal not like California with 3 million illegal vote. It lets talk about that I'm glad I brought that up at the airport. So where are you getting your the media media. Some of them was CNN I believe c and said the 3 million illegal people vote. It was coming across the media to see and didn't do it then they were being smart this time. Do you think that to live in California that they were illegal that I don't to tell you to nobody really knows that number. Do you think three dozen or do you think I think there was a good amount because the president old people that they could vote and that happened in sure we caught some people that they wanted to Nash when they said the present that I can hear a li ga. Do you hear president Obama say that a little people could you know. You can find it on Facebook. All right, how long I don't want to waste any more time. But anyway, I see where it came from and it's a fox business network disk edit a clip of Rock of moment to argue that the president and courage the legal immigrant to vote when in fact it said nothing of the sort when you go back to the script you as your sister today I think that millions of illegal people voted in this country you believe that there was wide spread voting abuse think there was in some states, taking the millions of people I California allows it, people do not allow illegal you mean you mean voter fraud California allow I believe there was voted for it in this country.
