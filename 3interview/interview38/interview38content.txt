I started writing young adult fiction in 2000, three the first book came out in 2004, so it was really more toward the beginning of they a wave that has been going on. I think a lot more adults are reading it. I mean I think that's very very common to see adults reading way and it's certainly a battle that you see in a lot of newspaper articles and things where people are wild the shame for reading y and other ridiculous things like that. Some people say is it the twilight effect? Is it the hungry? Now it's going to be the hunger games of effect. It's I think more than Harry potter effect. I think that the first time you really saw adults, r, frequently carrying around books intended for younger years was probably around 2000. When you started to see everybody carrying around Harry potter. And I think that the reason it's taken off so much is that it. It's good. I think it's actually that simple. It's exciting. It has its dis tract as and its dis tract as general e. Don't know much about it. You know it's director tend to Sherry pick five books have freedom and say all of this is nonsense. R it's not nonsense. It's good stuff. And I think that's what all the director's are missing constantly over and over again is that these books change lives in a very positive way. Almost universal a positive way, but they have to write negative articles about it because negative articles cell. And it's a good pitch to go and say have you heard about the latest thing that is going to kill your children. Of course that article has been coming around for years and years and years it was going to be Rock and roll. And it was going to be a motion pictures and comic books and video games and so many things that are going to destroy your kids, its an article that sells and selves and selves, and now they just right it about y. But. People aren't buying it.
