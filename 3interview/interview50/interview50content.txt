Why are you avoid being interview by Andrew Neil, because I think we got a perfectly brilliant and that's definitely what do you hear your right but its a different audience. Um I am doing on this program interview with all the party leaders including yourself Anthony is trying to do in use with all the party leader in evening, in an evening with the different with everybody else is that he couldn't have you couldn't have a more brilliant agent if I may say so than than you and if if you really want to II think the people of the country to race for what is our program for government will be great if you say now I will do and to be the end of you buy any interview a cold and ru from the BBC there was no in this is very important is nothing to do with the role and there was nothing to do with the service of how many is legal there was no way of stopping him come out from coming out on the basis on which he was sent. So. As for your question about how many others are there are, probably you you're trying to avoid my question I carry on talking let me ask you again that you said how many of the 24/7 seven tea for other people, what are you doing about them now? What we are doing that as you taken a lot of, as you mentioned in the last 48 hours to what they want to go into the operational details and we are getting people and where we are doing that I'm sure people can, imagine what we are doing to ensure that the seven tea for other individuals who have been let out the early on the basis of this labor change the legislation and they are being properly in vigil ate it says to make sure there is no threat. So when you hold on we took that action. So when you heard this, you will concerned that this kind of thing could happen again and again and again, given the number of people who are getting out now. But I do think there is an issue as I have said about automatic only release I think it's wrong for serious sexual a friend as I think.
