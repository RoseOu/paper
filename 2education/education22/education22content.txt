Hi, this is Emily from minute. Plastic is incredible strong and can be moved into a mind for going away of stuff, but that strength also makes plastic stick around long after we actually need it because I'm like most materials it simply does a never fully break down. Each type of plastic is made of one chemical unit, such as leen repeated thousands of times over in long noodle likes trans, which is my plastic name is all start with Polly the Greek word for many quad rille eons of the strand get tang ga lan rap to space shuttle shi ting. Over time force is like heat and tension can separate the angle strand of plastic from each other, causing Big Bang. So while. Large fits of plastic break into small, but those small but never really disappear. So scientists are new to ling around for a way to create less permanent plastic new version is such as poly lak dai r still made up of repeated chemical units. But instead of those ever last in carbon carbon bonds, the chain xa held together by different types of length like carbon oxygen bonds which can be easily cut eve and buy water. And the result ING bit can ultimately BD gest ID by bacteria. So after a few dozen years out in the world or just a few months in the right processing facility, these new plastic can dig it completely in to just calm and I ark side and water. But so far there are some draw back poly lactic, for example, is more expensive than traditional plastic and the carbon oxygen bonds that make it a great ball also give it a fairly lo. So often in point making it not so practical for some use as so we still haven't cooked up the perfect place to get, but scientists are excited about the possibility.
