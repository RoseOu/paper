Hi, this is Emily from minute. Domestic Asian has published i'd dogs life of cheap and specified was obvious physical change that for Charlie all the mess to cated animals share and brain. Duck brains have struck by about 15% cat brains by 30 and pick brains by a walking 35%. We're even found smaller brains in the farm drought. Which is weird because in general the size of animals brains and the size of their bodies is super tight lipped might have smaller brains and aunt switch have smaller brains and mice which have smaller and elephant and so on the same relationship exist for individuals within species. So for example, small walls have smaller brains and big wolf and small dogs have smaller than big dog's, but when you compare walls and dogs between individuals of the same size, the walls have bigger brains, no matter what that body size is. What's more across different to MR cated animals a dis proportion amount of the age happened in parts of the brain that monitor. We know that in general animals with bigger panic button have a more sensitive to fight or flight response and animals with small a panic button zan naturally tamer. So those are the ones we probably would have tried to dim es tic ate and by reading the most animals with each other we Rock the panic button and there for their brains even further. In short domestic ated animals have formed long term partner ships with humanity by literally losing their minds.
