Noise. There are no bad, but as there are only bad people, how does that sound OK? No one knows who invent ID the button. It might have shown up as early as two thousand BC e. It was decade of when it first started just something pretty sound on to your clothes then about three thousand years later someone finally invent ID the button hole and but an was suddenly useful. The button and the button hole is such a great invention not only does it slip through the button hole, but then it kind of like falls into place and so you're completely secure like it's never going to open the design of a button. Hasn't changed much since the middle ages its one of the most in during designs in history for me. The best but ns are usually round. There is either a down but on with a little shang or there is just this sort of like round thing with either a rim or not to be the two holes off or holes almost more important than the button is the button hole. And the way you figure that out is the day I am a ter of the button plus the width of the button plus a little bit of ease. Before, but ns. Clothes when bigger. They were more kind of a more fit and people like rigor ld in to them were like just kind of rap themselves and things but then fashion move closer to the body as we discovered uses to the bus at one time. It was the one way to make clothes fit against the body I think the reason but and have and yours for so long historical is because they actually work to keep our clothes shop zip is break fell from makes a lot of noise and where is out after a while if a button for you just literally so that thing on a button is kind of there for the long run its not just the. Most la mental design ever it's also such a crazy fashion statement. When I was a kid my mom not me this beautiful sweater, I didn't like it and then I found the button in the minute the button when I'm the sweater I loved it. If you don't have good taste and you can't pick out about and then let someone else do it, you know. I mean that.
