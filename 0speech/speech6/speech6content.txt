å•ŠI was appointed six months ago, and the more of spoken about them in ism. The more I have realized, the fighting for women's rights has too often becomes an onym ous. With man, hey ting. If there is one thing, I know for certain it is that this has to stop for the record, Eminem by definition, is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of the political economic and social equality of the sex. I started a question in the basis options a long time ago. When I was eight, I was confused being called boss. Because I want it to direct the place that we would put on for our parents. But the boys were not when at 14, I started to be sexual ised by certain elements of the media. One at 15. My girlfriend started dropping out of the love of sports teams, because they didn't want to appear muscle. One at 18. My male friends were unable to express their feelings. I decided that I was a ministry. And this seems complicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that families and has become an on popular word. Women choosing not to identify as minister. Apparently, his expression r seen as to strong too aggress if eisel ating. And and he men and attractive even, why has the words become such an uncomfortable one? I am from Britain. And I think it is right that I am paid the same as my male counter parts. I think it is right. That I should be able to make decisions about my own body. I think it is right. That women be involved on my behalf in the policy. And the decisions that will affect my life. I think it is right. That's social. I am a for did the same respect as men. But sad li. I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive the's rights. No country in the world can yes say that they have achieved the gender equality. Thank you very, very much.
