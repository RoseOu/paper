In these years and your letter and and I take the tough questions we get asked and give our answers. One that's come up for a long time is as we make the world health is the population to get so big that feeding everybody and maintain ING the environment is going to be impossible. Here we can see that looks at the total world population over the last several hundred years. And at first glance this is a bit scary and we go from less than a billion in 1800 and then 3456 and seven point for building where we are today is happening even faster. Some land and I wondered whether providing new mad Ison zh on keep in children live with that create more of a population problem. But we found out is that is health improve. Families choose to have less children. And this effect is very, very dramatic. We find it in every country of the world. This is repeated, the population growth goes down as we improve health. So we have taken that part that shows the global population growth. And we're actually extend it out all the way to twenty 100. And we can see that instead of continuing it actually what is out, another way to see that is through this rate of population growth and you can see that in the six tea's that reach to pretty high number over 2% per year. And it's now come way way down. Now I love billion people still a lot, but the good news is that the fast we improve health, the faster family size goes down. And so we can feel great about saving the's lives.
