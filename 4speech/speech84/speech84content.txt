we believe in making a world a better place and we're trying to do that through design but the world for us starts with our company our first product weigh band is a wearable haptic navigation device for the blind and visually impaired lea got an article published and it had made his way to his guy with simon we cross he reached out to us and he was like if you can have this technology ready by November I'll run a New York City Marathon with it we saw it and it was kind of like moonshot this is probably not gonna work but let's just do it and see how far we can get in Keith's story I see a microcosm that reflects a greater macrocosm in terms of an emerging set of values what we found is that everyone has a set of tensions in their work in life things like making a living and making a life or fulfilling the organization's needs and the needs at the end of the jewel we navigate those tensions using our own unique strategies for example working remotely learning new skills or self-care navigating these tensions is critical because a lot is at stake for us when we show up to work like our sense of purpose or our connection to our families and communities and for me and this organization this is why we should care about designing a more enlightened way of working we see a company as a vehicle to design life with as opposed to something to conform to where works is really thinking holistically about navigating their tensions for example when it comes to attention like making a living and making a life what kinds of cultural practices and policies need to be in place to support a strategy like flexible or remote work where works we have this policy call wherever words and the basic idea is that we don't really care where people are as long as the work gets done by doing so we make our employees ridiculously happy and by doing that we get the best work from people we're seeing that people everywhere are challenging these inherited default ways of working they want access to more choices more agency the freedom to decide how they want to work this supports them to better navigate the tensions in their work in life for the sake of preserving what's at stake for them we did six months brand and on November 5th 2017 Simon ran the first 15 miles of the New York City Marathon and without any sighted assistance working with the blind and visually impaired was a wonderful challenge it's a different feeling when you go to work every day and the thing that you do actually help the needle of humanity in some way move forward where works embodies what an enlightened way of working means for people out in the world today you
