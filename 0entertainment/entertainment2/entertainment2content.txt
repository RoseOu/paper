å—¯when I come back here that you like a movie in my mind. This is the place we start. I mean the person I was looking forward ido n't wanna look at the things back. It was not easy. So every time I come back here, I have a motion that how could this thing happened? I mean, how can we go through these days? But we know we got the tough days we can never be today. I remember exactly the first day when we came back, we will take all the luggage come here and I told everybody this is the place we are going to work for a year we got to eat here we got to sleep here we got to working day and night here. And we will probably achieve something or Pro. We will have to go out to looking for jobs together. The go at that time we won't be the Top 10 web sites in the world. At that time we are running like a problem, 1 million of something, one or 2 million. But the most important that the early bus service should help in millions of small business, young people and power them unable to realize their dreams in this room, we have we have nothing to lose. One night I put a teen people here all together because we have a lot of internal fight as you guys remember now we are lucky we are in the small room I believe 1015 years later. You cannot even funny chung ga. You probably work in Beijing you probably in Shanghai somebody to work in the United States you probably don't meet each other, so we should respect our pretty days with together. We had a Dolly by here when the Top of here we had only my hair when the deep talk here, most of the very good strategic companies start up they will want to do with put it here. That's why I always want to keep this place. Because no matter how big ali baba is, no matter where only but will be, no matter what industry we are in, we always remember this hou pan culture, this garage culture. And the thing that I want this company never forget is the dream because we are at today's size lot of people just want you know a lot of companies I learn when they feel because they want next quarter. They want to revenue and a profit forget about dreams is important to keep our dreams is the dreams that keep us working hard is dreams that keep us never afraid of the mistakes the set back we have. I hope 60 years later, eight years later people still remember this apartment should never lose the dream we had from Japan, at the apartment.
