actin activated basal mg2+-atpase activity ~15-fold
calmodulin light chains exhibited actin-activated atpase activity

sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis
quenching correction introduced substantial scatter
purified myo1c apparently includes 2 --3 calmodulins
including essential light chain isoforms
ca2+ increases myo1c atpase activity
