degradation-susceptible clostridium difficile strains


field gel electrophoresis
random amplified polymorphic dna technique
difficile strains remained difficult due
discourage mature spore formation
difficile molecular fingerprinting techniques
optimized method differs significantly
ensure optimal bacterial lysis
sufficient dna remained present
united kingdom epidemic strain
