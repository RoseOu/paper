thyroid hormone receptor t3r binding site upstream
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
major late transcription factor/antioxident response element
avoids finding spurious poorly conserved instances
global multiple alignment tools failed
simple premise underlying phylogenetic footprinting
tree-based global multiple alignment program
existing motif discovery programs ---
segment-based multiple alignment program dialign
large-scale genome rearrangements occurred
