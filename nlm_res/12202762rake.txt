present results support qualitatively similar premelting mechanisms
typical raman melting curve exhibits variable slope
liquid-nitrogen cooled charge-coupled device detector
idealized temperature-dependent raman band exhibiting hypochromic behavior
tract exhibits highly propeller-twisted base pairs
recent independent determination employing uvrr spectroscopy
conventional watson --crick hydrogen bonds
po2 -- symmetric stretching mode
current data tabulations rely primarily
