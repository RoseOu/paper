additional far-red fluorescence color broadens abilities
mutant named dsred-nf intensively absorbed light
intensively colored non-fluorescent clones contained ala
achieve desirable protein properties artificially
ascp carry chemically distinct chromophores
extremely low fluorescence quantum yield
properties make dsred-nf practically indistinguishable
major red light-absorbing spectral forms
recombinant proteins contained 6-histidine tag
