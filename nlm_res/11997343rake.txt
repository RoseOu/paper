reporter gene fusions involved standard molecular biology procedures
5 --7-kb genomic dna restriction fragments
conserved genes gave reporter gene expression
364 effectively randomly selected annotated genes examined
well-conserved amino acid residues appears
current reporter gene fusion approach
consecutive amino acid residues
gfp reporter gene expression vectors
ribonuclease-diphosphate reductase encoding gene
dominant marker gene rol-6
