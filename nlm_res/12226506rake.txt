diverse loci affecting aba response
aba outer-plasmalemma perception triggers early activation
silica gel 60 thin-layer chromatography plates
abolished aba-induced cytosolic [ca2+] oscillations
inhibit aba-induced cytosolic [ca2+] oscillations
gdpbetas rendered pld activity insensitive
proteins relay extracellular signals perceived
plasmalemma abscisic acid perception leads
barley aleurone microsomal fraction enriched
aba triggered similar early events
