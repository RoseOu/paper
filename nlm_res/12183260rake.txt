liquid broth microdilution assays demonstrate growth reduction resulting
standard liquid broth microdilution assays
antifungal echinocandin caspofungin acetate kills growing cells
fluorescence versus cell density yielded curves
caspofungin preferentially affected actively growing cells
altered cell wall composition led
inhibiting yeast cell wall formation
cell wall formation occurs exclusively
hyphal tips suggest caspofungin caused lysis
5 mug/ml prevented alamar blue reduction
