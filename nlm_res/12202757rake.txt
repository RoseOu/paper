recent raman spectroscopic investigation showing non-specific interactions
report show multiple liquid crystalline phase transitions
multiple textures exhibiting highly birefringent domains
highly ordered liquid crystalline dendrimeric structures
concentration-dependent spontaneous liquid crystal formation
high molecular weight calf thymus dna
highly ordered columnar hexagonal phase developed
highly charged anionic polyelectrolyte nature
provoking multiple liquid crystalline forms
molecules spontaneously undergo unidirectional ordering
