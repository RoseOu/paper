eventually phosphorylates myosin ii heavy chain
=partially hydrolyzed  hisactophilin-deficient cells exhibit reduced viability
understood signalling pathway involves myosin ii translocation
adding fixed staphylococcus aureus cells
additional signalling pathway concomitantly regulating
mouse monoclonal alpha-hisactophilin antibody 54-11-10
axenically grown wild type cells
spb buffer/5 mm propionic acid
cells overexpressing hisactophilin ii exhibit
hisactophilin ii-gfp fusion protein expressed
