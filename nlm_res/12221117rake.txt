arf-binding protein
glutathione s-transferase
mannose 6-phosphate receptor
prevacuolar compartment
red fluorescent protein
trans-golgi network
domain present
arf  = adp-ribosylation factor
gal4 activation domain
gal4 binding domain
gga
current evidence strongly favors gga --arf interaction
mannose 6-phosphate receptor
lipid modifying enzymes act upstream
tom1
green fluorescent protein
localized  = gga
mutant yeast gga proteins retain golgi localization
genes disrupts distinct post-golgi trafficking events
unique site elimination mutagenesis kit
gtp-bound arf recruits mammalian gga proteins
