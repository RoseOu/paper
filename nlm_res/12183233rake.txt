north carolina ---chapel hill [unc-ch] sequencing facility
single aspartic acid residue preceding asp-345
created silent unique restriction sites surrounding
unique bgli site located 40 bp downstream
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
naturally occurring charged amino acids
side chain charge versus size
strains exhibited similar growth curves
porib dna harboring randomized codon mutations
aerogenes porin conferred reduced susceptibility
