cytosolic pla2 specifically hydrolyzes sn-2 arachidonate
protein kinase pathways play major roles
mek1/erk pathway reduces arachidonic acid release independently
group iv cpla2alpha-specific inhibitor pyrrolidine-1
mek1/erk pathway significantly blocks aa release
mek1 inhibition reduces cpla2 catalytic activity
significantly affect anisomycin-stimulated p38 phosphorylation
pd98059 inhibits zinterol-mediated aa release
mediating aa release remains unclear
measure cpla2 mediated aa release
