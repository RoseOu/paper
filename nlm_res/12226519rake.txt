carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor nf inhibits hema1 expression
subjected transgenic arabidopsis lines overexpressing pora
key chlorophyll synthesis enzyme glutamyl-trna reductase
por-overexpressing lines appeared totally white
hema1 promoter region fused upstream
numerous photosynthetically related nuclear genes
distinct phytochrome a-mediated plastid signaling pathway
400 --700 nm = 130 mumol m-2 s-1
1 mumol m-2 s-1 frc failed
por-overexpressing seedlings accumulated significant levels
