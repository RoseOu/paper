key biosynthetic enzymes controlling anthocyanin formation
250 mumol m-2 s-1 showed reduced levels
60 mumol m-2 s-1 showed low expression
det1 mutation increases cab expression levels
circadian system principally regulates chs expression
luc rhythm preferentially reflects epidermal luminescence
circadian clocks share similar molecular components
peak enzyme activity lags slightly
circadian periods reflect tissue-specific modifications
250 mumol m-2 s-1 increased expression
