latently infected versus mock-infected ganglia revealed numerous differences consistent
sybr gold nucleic acid gel stain
classical host immune responses exhibited increased expression
small glial cells called satellite cells
cellular gene expression included cdnas encoding chrm1
latent hsv infection affects neuronal gene expression
latently infected versus mock-infected mouse trigeminal ganglia
