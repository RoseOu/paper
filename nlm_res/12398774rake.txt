vitro studies reveal tumor necrosis factor adsorption
low filtration fraction promotes im sieving
nonlinear dynamic control system operating
high filtration fraction promotes adsorption
ionic strength significantly affect adsorption
feed solution proteins adsorbed depends
so-called hemofiltration filter adsorption/synergistic effect
exhibits meaningful biologic effects
nonlinear dynamic control system
high filtration fraction prevailed
