genome-scale extreme pathways elucidate emergent system-wide properties
developed approaches elucidated important emergent properties
organisms make direct comparisons difficult
unique flux maps called extreme pathways
potentially hold significant physiological meaning
individual nonessential amino acids common
100% open reading frame assignments
implementing simple thermodynamic principles
ribonucleotide sets showed similar degrees
provide physiologically important characterizations
