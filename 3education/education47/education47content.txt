Hi, this is Kate for minute. Most rain never reach the ground because it falls on the ocean, but even a lot of rain that falls over land does not reach the ground. Some of it disappeared before it gets very far. Peter simulation suggest that about 40% of falling rain disappeared back into the sky and when does touch down it land mostly on earth forest, that's because where ever lots of rain falls thirst e trees Dominic by going to tall and wide and shaking out most of the plants, these big leaf is also have an inter cept almost all of the rain that falls on them. However, just as people can't drink through their skin and trees can absorb water through their leaves are so the inter cept in water isn't directly a used to them. Most of it drip sore for run down their trunk eventually reach in the ground where the trees can. Suck it up with their roots, but some of the tree Top one are also our eyes off of the leaves in bar returning about 15% of the rain that originally left the clouds back up into the sky the that alone might not sound like a lot, but when combined with the rain drops that of great that immense amount of water in stead flow back up words as vapor, the equipment of 15 Amazon river is climbing invisible through the sky. Thanks to Georgia southern university for sponsor in this video, which was made possible by national science foundation Grant to John van Stan Stan is the professor in gs used the department of a and geography. And he studies how well different trees capture rain that falls on that research from his group and it's color ate as has helped us understand the vital importance of the rain catching abilities, including the way they reduce the storm water flood ING down pours thus saving us a billion of dollars a year in flood ING damage. Thanks Georgia southern.
