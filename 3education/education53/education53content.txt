In the fif teenth century aristo cratic British hunter invent it some women ical label for groups of animals like a girl of gas, a school of fox and the charm of finch is these collect the hunter's to share their appreciate for nature of animals but for shooting the terms like a leap of letters and a rum of others give us a sense of their behavior terms like a memory of star ling and a crash of rhino, let us hear them nearby. And terms like a murder of clothes and an expectation of LUX make us feel a particular way do to their presence. And just like the fif teenth century hunter's we also collected lean on the creatures modern to our day like a miss chee foo of pictures or a colleague of robot. OK kind of ridiculous but at its heart this is just people showing their passion and appreciate for nature and language and fun and taken all together the ballet of nut crack of parliament of owls Flora by of butter flies not of labor, of mole, wisdom of long bat and so on are a women of collecting.
