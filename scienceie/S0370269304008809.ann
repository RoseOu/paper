T1	Task 52 135	detecting the location of, say, one missing level on an otherwise complete sequence
T2	Process 173 200	information theory concepts
T3	Process 217 243	correlations in a sequence
T4	Task 292 333	error correcting codes can be constructed
T5	Task 462 489	detecting one missing level
T6	Process 356 411	no correlations and therefore no redundancy are present
T7	Process 413 432	Poissonian sequence
T8	Task 515 548	sequence of equally spaced levels
T9	Task 550 562	picket fence
T10	Task 601 665	missed level can be obviously detected as a hole in the spectrum
