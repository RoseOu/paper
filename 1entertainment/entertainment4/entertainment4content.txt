Blue is the only you are still the Top score in the history of this competition that has not gone away you had a great year for club and country with in the sweater in your first season in Italy the nation's league with a girl as well. You love a Challenge how is this first year in Italy been for you? Amazing. It was a special year because I I moved on I was nine years in reality to move to tell on was a big move for the amazing one three times super cup and national scope against all and which is fantastic. Yes visual. I did very well, collect them as well. So amazing here and I'm I'm so glad and other here and now the records so perfect. Now we haven't had you both. Together for a while. So while you are both here we noticed you've been talking a lot you miss him Australia I don't know is this love, know I like you. What is nice? Of course I miss. I miss to play in in Spain we have that battle the last 15 years which is good you push me and I push him as well so it's good to be to be part of history of football and there any of course is there as well. You had a recent interview you take on a little bit out of context saying that you're going to retire next year. I think it's very clear for you that you're not retire and just yet you ll be around for a while can we just ask you to make sure you retire at the same time as low, get the minutes to get around this moment to get to is two years younger than me. The people who don't like me they are going to see me here. The hate is the part of the Christian. I mean we want to see this rival ry go on as long as possible. Thank you very much weight of you.
