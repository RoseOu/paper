 Family. What do you guys think should we do a back lip? Oh, boy. As it's been to live and work here for so long, it's super good news that Jessica and I will soon return to earth and just less than a week and its gonna be great to hug my wife and kids again so I'm not really looking forward to grab a tea, OK one last look at the earth. This is some good news, the earth on earth in crisis is still on earth. See you later. What just happened I'm going to need a second to catch my breath.
