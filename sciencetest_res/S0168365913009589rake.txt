us-induced cavitation events produce distinct acoustic emissions
event called inertial cavitation
characterised providing non-invasive feedback
collapse creates shock waves
co-localised liposomal drug carriers
inertial cavitation stimulus
violent collapse due
shown great promise [16]
generate gas bubbles
pre-existing gas bubbles
