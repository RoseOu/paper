When on January 31st eye institute of the band job and went crazy, he said you don't need the ban you hitting a like he didn't even know what the hell the band was, but he so he didn't go crazy, but he didn't say he did call me wait a minute, he called me is in a phobic. He called me just because he has since apologize and he said I did the right thing. So when you say why didn't you this everyday MC rat thought I made a mistake when I did it, I save tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives by her. But yourself some time you didn't. 1. No, we do what you do. What do you do when you have no case and the whole of states when you excuse me, you report it zero cases, zero death on January 17. I said in January, on January 30. We did a lot. You know you are a fake, you know that your whole network the way you cover is faith and most of you and not all of you but the people of eyes to you, that's why you have a lower and lower Pro writing than you have ever had before time's probably three. And when you ask me that question, let me ask you this, why didn't know why didn't why did by the apology is why did he write a letter of apology know that is very important. Why did the democrats think that I acted to quickly. You know why? Because they really thought that I acted to quickly, we have done a great job now I could have I could have kept it open. And I could have done what some countries are doing their getting beat up pretty badly. I could have kept it open I thought of keeping it open because nobody has ever heard of closing down a country let alone the United States of America. But if I would have done that we would have had hundreds of thousands of people that would write now be dead. We have done this right and we we really we really have done this, right? The problem is the press, doesn't cover it the way it should be good. One more questions to you guys.
