Lets talk about what's happening in this administration. Is it very hard for in a nice way lets try to be nice what is it is it hard to sit and watch from the side lines and see what's going on have you reached out to president trump to try to talk to him. I have reached out to the vice president. I try to keep in contact rI did this cancer moon shot for the president and so I continue to have contact with the elements of the administration that are following through in the recommendation is you made. But um I don't think anyone should at least the form of vice president shouldn't be criticism. A president of the United States when you are a Broad I don't think we should have to do that and I don't think we should be the position of central e, talking about a different foreign policy. So it's been. But that that's the extent to which has been any interaction right until you run for president and 2020. To people are going through what i've been through. I mean it's a and so I I'm just not and I honest to god I haven't made my mind. I have I have done not a single thing that would to to promote that or to organization do anything. And I'm very flat of people say nice things but now my dad had another expression, he say, joey, don't compare me to the mighty compare me the alternative. Think the reason I'm looking good now is the alternative. I really honest to god have not made him, want to focus on my boy. Remember that that's what I would like to see and ur and I don't know if it's going to be myself for over as you running mate. But I think that. It's not your focus rite. Now your focus is the book on it should be it's a fantastic and as you said it is what we need right now in the world is hope and then you have been through a lot and you are AAa wonderful is over well me reason for hope we are so better position than any country in the world, to own the 21st time we really are, we are so incredible this time.
