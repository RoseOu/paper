achieve high aspect ratio structures
standard sf6/c4f8 inductively coupled plasma
complex etch processes requiring specialised
increasing achievable aspect ratios
smaller lithographic nodes continues
adopt thinner resist films
mixed mode etch process
multilayer process slightly increases
final silicon pattern transfer [25
