rapidly varying electromagnetic field produced
extremely high electric field gradient
high electromagnetic field gradient
excellent theoretical testing ground
form longitudinal waves
high-intensity laser pulses
density waves propagate
wave eventually collapses
plasma electrons form
laser-driven plasma wave
