We're going to go our economy, we're going to make our country more secure will strengthen our families. And most important we will live a most important we will live up. Most most important we will live up to our characters as a nation. That's that's that's exactly what we're talking about you. What was that? With this has no need to go. Let me finish. I respect the passion of the young people, because they feel deeply about the concern for their families. Now what you need to know when I'm speaking, as present the United States. And I come to this community is that if in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in congress. Then I would do so. But we are also a nation of laws that spot of our tradition. And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by via lei ting are laws. And what I'm propose ING is the hard path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy is just shout ING. It requires the lobby and getting it done. So they are so so for those of you who are committed to getting this done. I am going to March with you and fight with you every step of the way to make sure that we are well come ING every hard working immigrant who sees the American the same way we do as the country where no matter who you are, where you what you look like or where you come from, you can make it if you try. And if you're serious, about making that happen. Then I'm ready to work with you. But it is going to require work. We're going to be late the law. That's not our tradition. But the great thing about this country is we have this wonderful process of democracy and sometimes it's messy and sometimes it is hard. But ultimately justice. And truth went out. That's always been the case in this country that is going to continue to be the case today.
