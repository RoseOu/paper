It is October and there are two things I love to do in October scare people. And watch people get scared of those are my two favorite things. So I thought I show you a few videos of people getting the who ha scared out of them. This is a fine this is really really mean II will show to you anyway. It's a daughter scary her mother. How to him. This is really cool. I don't know where this is, but it's a museum. It has an interactive monitor, so it looks like it's a shark tank. It's really cool. So this is one phase of Anna Belle she gets creep here and keep your. Yeah, I don't know he looks different the light, but she this is a different one than what I used the produce of the movie. By the way of interesting fact the apartment in the movie was my first apartment that I moved to an la that was the building I lived in where they shot the movie was watching it going that looks familiar and it was my building. It was scary back then to anyway, so um the produce sent me an a bel r because I love the movie and I decided to take her around the office and surprise some people. Most in my produce a and e because he get scared really really easily. And so these are several things throughout the day.
