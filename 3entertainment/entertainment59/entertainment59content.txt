Thank you so much back at you, I feel the same way and I know what you're all thinking day I melon. If you don't know what I'm talking about yesterday we had to high school students on the show who became famous by saying damn Daniel. When I was in high school, Ia damn and I got the tension, that's what happened to me. So they post a damn Daniel video on snapchat you know it's now that is everybody snap when you snap your chat. No snap chat is an APP and it lets you send pictures in short videos that disappear after you watch them. It's like a combination of the Stig RAM memory loss. That's what it is. And I did it ll research and these are some of the statistics about snapchat it has 7 billion years a day snapchat users share overnight and photos per second. The biggest stars and snap chat can make over $a hundred thousand a week, a hundred thousand hours a week damn Daniel. I need to stop talking and get on snapchat right now. We are on snapchat but bring my and you where you bring my phone and let me show you something. Thank you say close in case of mess up OK. So snapchat one of the things that has is it has something called lens is and I am going to show you what I'm talking about is here OK. Å¶o o. Am I reach you?
