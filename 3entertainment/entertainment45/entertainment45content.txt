20 for magic eyes, produce a champion present engineer. Å¶can I tell you all star real quick, don't cut me off grandma please. I must try to do this have been drinking celebrating a little bit. So I'm 15 years old and I'm opening up a show in Hawaii called the magic of Asia I'm in front of the current and I'm singing songs. My job. And that show was to entertain about a thousand people a thousand years from all over the world. And I won't put together a set list like 10 to 12 songs and not be honest I was incredible at 15 I was and later on in life i've found out that those songs that I was singing and were written by the baby face Jimmy jam Terry Lewis r Teddy Riley. And with those songs, I remember. Seeing and I remember seeing the first hand people dance in that had never met each other from two sides of the globe dancing with each other thing with each other, celebrating together. All I want to do with this album was that and and you know those songs of written with nothing but joy and for one reason for one reason only on this love and that's all I wanted to bring with the south and hopefully I could feel that again and see everybody dancing on everybody moving.
