I have to ask you all if you've seen this new car commercial with Matthew MC con a, have you seen this? All right, how many people have not seen it? Just a few of you, its kind of it surprise me the first time I saw it, I thought that's interesting and you think that it's an interesting choice for him to do it. And and it is an du if you haven't seen it here it is. I have so many questions. But my biggest question is I don't know why they cut me out of it. That is my biggest question I was in the original version. And I think I made more sense when I was in it. Doing with your fingers. You don't like that 1 u like supposed to be a dinner by five.
