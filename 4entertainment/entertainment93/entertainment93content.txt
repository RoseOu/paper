Now and again to you have no to something about British people and the way they speak that we do a funny thing. You're well know I mean I love all the every regional accent every time. A.I. like that because there are so many access to such a small country. Everybody sort of put on different voices when they are doing little bits and stuff but I had a thing where I was checking in to a hotel, and somebody came out and said, oh do you help with your bags and I thought they were doing a bit. And they were on TV on Google box because it was stepha. So they actually talk like that that is I never knew that was a real hotel that everything you say, have a very good friend of mine was going to a really stress ful time and a lovely answered this and I'm going to get you a head massage. So she went to the clinic at the head massage she was in the room and the woman said, can you take your eyes off? But wait for head massage OK yes, oh she took the neck is off and she is like that. And then the woman came back and she was South Africa and she had no Nicholas Nicholas. In the necklace, Nicholas I get it. Back to me, I love it, ∑¿÷π°£
