Everyday we are getting closer to having a vaccine that can stop her own a virus, but it has to be safe and it has to work that doesn't happen overnight. What exactly is so there like a training course for our bodies immun systems. Our new systems recognize them as an in Vader and learn how to fight them. It means next time when we encounter the disease for real, our bodies already know how to fight it. What research is being done? The World Health Organization says more than 7 t different teams are currently working on a vaccine. It's quickly become the most important piece of scientific research in the world with some university pause ING other projects to work on it full time, with Charles being done with a number of animals, as well as in humans. When will it be ready? Scientists at the university of for to have said it could be as early as September 2020, but that. As if everything goes according to plan at every single stage, if something goes wrong that can push everything back. Most think it will be more like a year, 18 months from now. So the second half of 2021. Why so long while making a manufacturing a virus takes a lot of time. There's a lot we don't understand about this car owner virus, but we know is genetic code. This code is like a blue print. Some scientists are lifting parts of it and combine ING it with the existing virus is to create something that looks like the car owner virus. The idea is this can then be given to animals or humans. Others are in ject ING the ra code straight into test subject. When researchers think they found something that works, it has to be tested again and again and again and go through so many clinical trials to make sure it's effective and that there are no UN intended side effects. Even after that you have to make this fact seen on a massive scale and deliver and distributed to people. All over the world.
