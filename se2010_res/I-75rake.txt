gauvain bourgne
shortest path
lengths connecting
intermediary restricted hypotheses
exchange protocol
longer term issues concern
imagine evolving topological constraints
eventual mutual logical consistency
communication 
concretely takes place
exhibited conditions allowing convergence
argument exchange 
crucially depends
intuitively yield interesting results
comparative effectiveness ratio gain
previous result essentially shows
temporaly connex system guarantees
argumentation process gains efficiency
requirements concern request sending
single prefered theory
arbitrary fixed ranking
• environmental topology- performances
aforementionned topological 
constraints
