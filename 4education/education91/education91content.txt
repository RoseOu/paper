‡≈you've probably heard that leaves of decision was trees change colour and autumn because they lose their green chloro film molecule zl ow a is to res drop their leaves each year to avoid the high cost of winter rising them. But this season of sharing would be to waste ful to be worth doing if the trees lost all the valuable nutri as they live or ious lic STR acted from the soil to build their leaves earlier in the year. This is actually really Tiki because as the dis assembly starts, the core of film molecule that absorb sun light for photo synthesis are still absorb ING the sun's energy, but with no photos and this is happening, they end up passing the UN used energy a long to oxygen molecule which become danger ously active when the smoke. Damage ING the parts of the life that are in the process of the covering and transport in new tree inspect the rest of the tree to keep this destruction to a minimum leaves break down their glory fill in tle s, dangerous molecule that are typical transplant. So sometimes yellow, by the way, with the Bright green molecule is gone yellow and orange pigment that were there all along helping with photo synthesis are no longer over shadow and to yellow and orange leaves some trees take an extra autumn in proportion against the floor fill in destruction as the leaf dis man tle ING starts they build new special pigment to shade coral from some light on till it can be broken down. These new pigment tend to be red or purple and colour. So trees that use them have red leaves in the fall, sometimes in saint Lee Bright red in the end, these x quiz it gold and rust, et display's help the trees recover as much as 50% of the night rich and on phosphor us from their old leaves to help Pro fresh new green ones in the spring. They are perhaps the world's pretty re cycle ING the plants.
