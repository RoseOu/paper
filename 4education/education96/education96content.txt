Airplane jet engine's have gotten bigger and bigger over time and it's not just because planes are getting bigger. The air bus a three fifty is a smaller plane than the boeing seven forty seven, but has a bigger engine. The reason bigger engine r simply more efficient up to a point modern jet engine actually consists of two proportion systems working together the jet core which provides the power and a small amount of trust and the fan which is just a big Pro peller driven by the jet car and which provides most thrust pure jet engine can be incredible powerful, which is why there used for fighter jet set, but there also horrible e and efficient because they shoot out there exists as super high speed which is wait to huge amounts of net ich energy. Since kinetic energy is professional to the speed square, so seller rating exhaust to twice the speed to takes four times the energy in exchange for power they literally blessed energy away as a bunch of hot air. Of course you do have to shoot some air out of the back of the engine to generation.
