 Gift for that he clearly had a gift for that and he took that gift, and in bed in the company, it was on a gift that he kept to himself. And so one of eye, one of that I loved many things about is that is a dear friend, but he was also a great men, tor. He was a great teacher. This is something that's never written about him. But ur, what what he left and not just me but many of us is what he taught us. Is he was one of the best men to us in the in the world is it took me a a little by surprise. For that I mean he had talked me about being CEO before and so I always knew it was his long term thing that you would be not that not that specific moment and so hear and I had a discussion back and forth about because I was I was. Testing on this I said, you know, what kind of things do you want to do as chairman made it? And it's just sort of having a good answer with him. And I like I said, for example ads do you need to just do the ones that I think it right and or do you want to be involved in it. And he said, well, I hope you like my opinion on something. He I thought Charlie on that day that he would be chairman for a long time. That i'd be CEO for a long time, and that we will continue to work together. And so and he knew when he chose me that I wasn't like him. That I'm not a carbon copy of him. R 1. And so he obviously through that deeply about who he wanted to lead apple and so that I. I have always felt the responsibility of and I are wanted desperate li to continue his legacy. And the apple I deeply love. And so I from the on set I wanted to port every ounce that I had in myself into the company. And but in terms of being everything he was. I've never had that object ID. I've never had the objective of being like him, because I knew are the only person I can be as the person I am right and I'm not an actor, i'd be terribly hollywood. And and and so that's what ive done. I i've tried to be the best. Tim Cook I can be.
