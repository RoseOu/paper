One of the keys to apple is apple's an incredible. And so you know how many days we have an apple, no? Zero. If no no committee, we are there we are organized like a startup. One person in charge of iPhone os software. One person is in charge of MAC hard work. One person in charge of iPhone hardware engineering. Another person is in charge of world wide marketing and other person is in charge of operations. It's organized like a star to wear the biggest start up on the planet. And we all meat for three hours once a week and we talk about everything we are doing the whole business. And there's tremendous team work at the Top of the company, which filter is down to trim. This team work throughout the company, and teamwork is dependent on trust in the other folks to come through with their part without watching them all the time. But trust that they are going to come through with their parts. And that's what we do really well. And were great at figure out how to divide things up into these great teams that we have and all work on the same thing. Touch base is frequently and bring it all together into a product. We do that really well. And so what I do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and solve problems to make new products to make new marketing programs, whatever it is and our people willing to tell you you're wrong°¡¡£Yeah, I mean other than snoopy journal ists I mean people who work. Oh, so you can't if you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you. You have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to you have to be run by ideas, not hirearche. The best ideas have to win otherwise good people don't stay, but you must be more than a facility to who runs meaning is you can tribute your own, icon tribute idea is sure. Why would I be there?
