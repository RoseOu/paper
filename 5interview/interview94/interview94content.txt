One of the things that that people wrote in a lot of people have questions about the bank's about what's happened with the bank's what you've changed with some of your investment over time Jason gold bird rights and he said please ask more about his views on the bank stocks in general and on well Fargo in particular over the last two quarters, he sold the most a quarter of as long standing well go steak also in the 4th quarter, he dump to 3rd of his golden stock. Gold man sac shares, although he so loans are $75 billion in bank. What is so what do you think about bank's not necessarily the soul of today because you don't look at the by day well, bang king is a good business if you don't do dumb things on the outside, I mean basically and that's it. It's a business that the the bags we own on between r, the commercial banks in between 12%and 60% or so r aunt and not and blast sets. And that's a good business is a fantastic. Doesn't get it. The long term bond, u noe 2% of you have a choice between the 2% instrument, the 12% of which was going to win over time. So so if you ask me whether I think r. Thanks you are going to get on with a only on three or 4% of glasses. I don't think that will happen. The question is really whether they do something massive lid on I mean witch peri odic lia number of banks of done and I I I feel very good about the banks we all know there. They are very attractive compared to most other security as I see and and most of them are buying bank of America is buying in a lot of stock every year. So our old a ship of the bank of America this year probably will go up seven or 8% without of spending a dime. I'd like to doing any business any good business wear my owner ship was up seven or 8% of the year without me spending any money on Top of that I get it and so it they're very very attractive. Bother get STH interest rates and against against bonds and against other stocks in my view.
