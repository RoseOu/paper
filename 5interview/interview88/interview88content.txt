 Stuff has come out of college conversation is like that in the past. And for us what we discussed was that the biggest trend that was going on right now was that more and more Information was becoming available, but so going back to the kind of the start of the internet on main stream one browser's wear available and since then people have just been care more and more Information and that a lot of that was still being shared by a small number of companies or content produce, but that over time people would be sharing more and more Information themselves and how that happened was a really important thing. Right. So people care a lot about controlling your Information about themselves the reputation, their privacy. And there was just a kind of a big question about whether the the world would have all in this way that people would have control over that themselves or if that Information just be available. And so that's kind of on the one hand we we spent like all this time discussing that. On the other hand, I just put this little thing, right and you know so kind of those conversation in the back of my head, but what I was building was this out. Occasion for hard students, 6000 people to share some Information of themselves and stay connected with their friends and family. And what we basically just found since then is that that application is something that almost everyone wants to use that everyone has an identity that they want to express and friends and family that they want to stay connected with. And it's grown from the original 6000 person student body to more than 250 million people across the world on. The cool eye on it is now we're actually had an opportunity to shape of how that first sort of big trend to that that my friends and I discussed the five years ago about more Information on being available on people have control over the Information we have now been able to shape a bit how that plays out. It's been a really fun part of this.
