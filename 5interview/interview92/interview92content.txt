U told bacchi quick a few weeks ago on c nbc the economy was a little bit's off ter than it was six months prior and I know you watch the rail road number is like a hawk you like watching that. So we are the things stand right now on all things have changed a lot. And and I think I just heard a day in terms of them, actual airline figures but they just changed a lot and that that changed there's all kinds of ripple effects and that's the nature of an economy so that that people don't fly. Well, I can tell you one thing is kind of interesting r. We have seen the last two weeks, for example, r, pure accident report that you know we probably hear about at 365 days that we got 20000 accident report said a or something like that. So so like o on yeah yeah so we know when people are driving. That's that's the one that got a lot of reporting making them so then. And r. The last 10 days people just have been driving as much. And and the notice of that. Now you have to make that whether or just on all kinds of the things, but people have changed our behavior and of course the air lines and I think the day they announced that they are running about 25% down and colour. The very very Kelly was on the on cn BC and he said it was kind of perfect to normal up to about the last week of February and then it's just like somebody blow whistle and and that's what we I i've seen sort of evidence that that same sort of r sort of the wake on ING or whatever it may be the public, the the change their behavior, substantial eat that point.
