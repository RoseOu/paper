Now i've actually always found something that to be very true, which is um, most people don't get those experiences because they never ask. I've never found any body that didn't want to help me if I asked him for help. I always call him up I called up, this date me but I called it bill Hewlett when I was 12 years old. And he lived in Palo alto, his number is still the phone book. And he answered the phone himself that he said hi I'm Steve jobs and 12 years old, I am a student in high school and I want to build a frequency counter and I was wondering if and he laughed and he he gave me the spare parts to build the frequency count and he gave me a job that summer and he looked Packard working on the assembly line putting nuts in together on frequency count as he got me a job in the place the building. And I was in heaven and i've never found any one who said no or hung up the phone. When I call I just asked, and when people ask me I try to be as response if you have to pay that that that of gratitude back. R. Most people never pick up the phone call most people never ask and that's what separate sometimes the people to do things from the people that just dream about them. You got it, you got to act. And you've got to be willing to fail. You got to be willing to crash and burn. You know with people on the phone was starting a company with what ever if you're afraid of falling, you won't get very far.
