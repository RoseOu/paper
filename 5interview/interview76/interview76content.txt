Oh, I get to us a lot and I have a pretty standard answer, which is a lot of people come to me they say I want to be an Opera and I know that's great, what's your idea and I go I don't have one yet. And I say well I think you should go get a job as a bus boy or something to you find something you really passion at about because it's a lot of work. And I'm convinced that about half of what separate successful on tra nerf rum, the non success once is pure person. It is so hard. U poor so much your life in this thing, there are such rough moments in time that most people give up. I don't blame them, it's really tough. And it can your life I mean if you if you got a family and you're in the early days of the company is I can't imagine how one could do it I'm sure it's been done but it's rough and because it's a pretty much you know at 18 our day job seven days a week for a while. So unless you have a lot of passion about this, you're going to not survive you gonna give it up. So you got to have an idea of a problem or AA wrong that you want to write that your passion at about, otherwise, you're not going to have the per severe ance to stick it through. And I think that is half the battle right there.
