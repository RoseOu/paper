 Question is, given the important that you you lend to this in tui che on is in tui che on something you're born with or is it something that you've developed over your career so that you you kind of find your instinct I think it's more the ladder iii. I don't I don't think that that you're born with the god. I think you're the the gut mature. And it's better and better over time and what the struggle that most people have I think is learning to listen to it and figure out how to access it in some way. For me, though, what I found was that even though I'm an engineer and a little person at heart. The most important decisions I may have nothing to do with any of that. There they were always based on the ish and in the apple one is a prime example of that. You know I remember actually forming my list of places and minus. And I could not get the chart to work out the way I want it to. Because I wanted something to say, you know this is I should go to apple. But it would not. There was nothing financial would do that. I talk to people I trusted that new me and they said, this is not what you should do. It wasn't so easy and people said, you know you're just crazy you working for the Top PC company in the world. How could you even think of doing as you've lost your mind? And yet that voice said go west, young man go west. And sometimes you just have to go for it.
