Guardian in order to read your computer pagesI was pleased to come across an item in Microfile November 30about the launch of Teesside Poly's course on computerised communications using CMCS computer-mediated communication systemsdeliveryI was slightly taken abackhoweverto read that this was the UK's firstsuch courseCECOMM the Centre for Electronic Communications and Open Support Systems in Educationhas been delivering courses in computerised communications via CMCS since 1987CECOMM is the UK's leading value-added provider in the application of CMCS to education and trainingand has developed a set of formal communications-based methodologiesSocial Network Designwhich allow organisations to evaluate and access this delivery mechanism both at LAN and WAN local and wide area networklevelRather than reinventing the virtual classroommay I suggest the staff at Teesside Poly could have contacted CECOMM and availed themselves of our tutor-moderated training programmeand in the process saved themselves considerable time and angstStillthey are about to discover the very real difficulties of using this medium during the delivery of their first courseDick DaviesCoordinator

Tailored to fitIN SYSTEMS development nothing is more fundamental than assessing user requirementsIf you don't know what the system is required to doyou don't know anythingBut many system developers are unable to assess requirements properlyThey seem to think that you can ask a businessman what his requirements are and get an answer that amounts to a draft system specificationA doctor doesn't ask his patient what treatment to prescribeThe patient can explain only what the problem isIt is the doctor that provides the remedyIf you ask a user what sort of system he wants you will be met with a blank lookA user may have a deep knowledge of business problemsbut knowing little about computershas no idea how they should be tackledYetanalysts are heard asking time and againTell me what you wantWe've gone away from the days of systems imposed by the data processing departmentthis is going to be a system for the usersBut of course the users don't know what they wantso they end up getting another duff systemAn effective analyst provides the same service to the business as the doctor provides to the patientHe finds out what the needs of the business areand prescribes the cureThe user tells the analyst what the problems areand the analyst decidesat least in broad termswhat the user requiresBut the analyst has one great advantage over the doctorOnce the user becomes familiar with the proposed systemhelpful comments come thick and fastOhthis will be of great help in ordering raw materialsbut sometimes we get part deliveriescould we have an extra facility to deal with thoseAnd sometimes non-standard discount is givena pig to deal with on the old systembut if you could add one extra input box on that screen thereAnd what about orders not delivered on timeIf we could list those we'd have advance warning of shortage problems on the assembly lines two months before they occurNow that would be a great leap forwardUnfortunately you cannot reach this stage until you have developed a prototype systemAnd you can't develop a prototype system because the users haven't got a clue what they wantMost of them are probably mutteringI'm too busy to get involved in this sort of thingWhat's wrong with the old system anywayThe only way to develop a prototype is for the analyst to get inside the head of the user andthinking like a userdecide what sort of system is requiredOf coursethe initial system will not be perfectThe analyst cannot hope to understand the business as well in a few weeks as the user does after many yearsBut once the user sees the systemchannels of communication will openInstead of persuading the user to specify requirementsthe analyst will be driven by the user to meet key needsGood system development goes through two distinct phasesInitially the analyst does all the workleading the user towards a system he thinks is right for the businessBut once the user sees the potential of the systema change in attitude takes placeThe process becomes demand driven by the userThe analyst is then forced on the defensiveexplaining why new features cannot be included because they are technically difficult or prohibitively expensiveTraditionallysystems were validated by users agreeing functional specificationsIn theoryvalidation meant that the user had read the specificationimagined how the system would work in practiceand agreed the designIt was only when using a testversion of the system available just before the planned implementation datethat difficulties would come to lightand a host of change requests be issuedThe advent of fourth generation languages 4GLshas made system development much easierWith a 4GL an initial prototype can be put together quicklyThis means feedback is obtained early in the development processand the system can grow around the user's requirementsCrucial to the development process is the relationship built up between the analyst and the userThe best systems arise when both have a deep understanding of each other 's jobsMany developers use business analysts to ensure that the development team maintain a proper focus on business requirementsBut this can be counter-productiveas it cuts off communication between the systems analyst and the userToo much specialisation is bad for systems developmentit feeds the temptation to get engrossed in technical difficulties and forget about the underlying business needsIf you should stroll into a pub and meet an analyst and a user talking about workand you cannot tell one from the otherthey have probably developed a successful system

Computer editorALPHA is a new master operating system designed to interconnect disparate and widely distributed systems to act as a single cohesive wholeIt is being financed largely by the US Department of Defenseand made available freeAlpha is being developed for systems like the US Advanced Tactical Fighterwhich has about 20 real-time computer systems on boardthe NASA space stationand possibly the Strategic Defense InitiativeThe project is being led by Doug Jensen at the Concurrent Computer Corp.MassachusettsHe originally developed Alpha as a research project at Carnegie-Mellon UniversityThen General Dynamics used it to demonstrate a ground-based air defense applicationAlpha is written in C++ and will run initially on Concurrent's Mips-based multi-processor mini-supercomputerswhich will be launched next monthIt co-exists with Concurrent's RTU Real-Time Unixand has an object-orientated user interface designed for the production of largecomplexreal-time applicationsAlpha assumes the computing system is distributedand it includes replication mechanisms to provide distributed programming and survivabilityIt manages tasks by setting deadlines for their completioninstead of using interrupts simply to start them goingWhen deadlines can't be metAlpha gracefully degradesby meeting as many as possible of the most important onesAlthough the defence applications are obviousAlpha could become important in mission criticalcommercial systemsExamples include factory automation and large on-line financial networksA Baby Alphawill be developedusing VRTXfor smaller integrated systemsThe beta-test version of Alpha is due for release at the end of 1990with the first commercial release in 1993Concurrent says the ultimate aim is to produce a

the home computer companies are hoping to get fatLots of machines have been nicely packaged for the marketbut there are no bargains to be hadAnyone who just wants to play arcade-type games might as well buy a games consoleThese are relatively cheapthe games come on easy-to-load cartridges and areon averagebetter than the home computer versionsAtari invented the consoleand its old 2600 is the cheapest on the market at £40 or lessBut in the US and JapanNintendo has become the standardwith NEC and Sega being the main challengersHoweverwith NEC's PC Engine not officially available in the UKand the Nintendo system overpriced at around £100the Sega Master £80 or lessis the best choiceIt has good colours andalthough it uses a Zilog Z-80 processorlike the Spectrumthe games are fastThere are three points to bear in mind about 8-bit consolesFirstall the suppliers are preparing superior but incompatible 16-bit versionsincluding the Nintendo Super Famicom and the Sega Megadrive the latter having already arrived as an unofficial importat £200Secondgames cost much more than those for 8-bit home microsThirdyou can get a real computer for lessIndeedthe cheapest real computerhas a dual natureThe Atari XE is an £80 games console which comes with dedicated cassette recorder and an add-on keyboard which can be used for word processing orsayadventure gamesIt is also available as the Atari 65XE home micro for about £10 moreThe XE is a good machinebarely changed from the Atari 800 from 1979It has 64K of memoryan 8-bit 6502 processor and a poor BasicIt is rather faster than a Commodore 64and has similar graphics and soundwhich makes the hardware good valueYou can add disc drives and printers for serious useHoweverthe XE is not well supported by software housesand although it still has a lot of gamesmost of these are very oldTop 20 games are now almost never converted to run on itwhich purchasers would find very frustratingToday's 8-bit standards are the Commodore 64Spectrum +2 and +3and Amstrad CPC-464 and 6128Of theseonly the Commodore 64C is now worth buyingand only then if you never plan to add a disc driveThe Commodore 64 also has a 6502-type processor64Kvery good graphics and soundand the worst Basic still fitted to a home microBut it is very well supported for gamessince it is a standard in both the US and in Europewhereas the Amstrad and Sinclair Z-80-based machines failed in the USThe drawback with the C64 is that it is expensive at about £150The price includes a dedicated cassette recorderthe C2Nwhich doesn't work particularly wellif at allwith today's fast-loading gamesIt is much better to buy a naked C64 and one of the superior independent cassette players such as Mills Associates' Load-ItFurtherthe price means it isn't worth upgrading a C64 by adding Commodore's slow disc driveYou might as well buy an Atari STwith its better built-in disc driveto start withNeverthelessthe C64 is far superior to the Amstrad-made Spectrumwhich is on sale at the same priceThe Spectrum +2with its built-in cassette recordersimply isn't worth £150The +3 is better value at £200since this includes a built-in disc driveHoweverthis is the 3-inch drive peculiar to Amstrad productsand you would be better off paying the extra £35 for a discount Atari STThe Amstrad CPCalthough quite a good microis also poor value nowThe CPC-464 comes with cassette recorder and mono monitor for £200which makes the C64 a better buyThe CPC-6128 comes with a built-in 3-inch disc drive and colour monitor for £400which again makes an Atari ST a better buyand the Commodore Amiga a tempting alternativeAmstrad has held its CPC prices constant for over five years nowapart from throwing a few extra baubles joystickgamesinto the mixThey used to be extremely good valuenow they are eminently ignorableIs Alan Sugar happy to watch this range declineOf courseAtari has not cut the price of its ST micro for two yearsbut at least the raw 520ST-FM has a powerful 16/32-bit Motorola 68000 processor512K of memoryupgraded 720K disc drive and a mouseAlso this £300 machine is often sold for much lessand old models which have a single-sided 360K driveare available for as little as £175The Atari ST has dominated the 16-bit market over the last couple of years as a dual purposemachineIt can be used for serious computingas a poor man's Apple Macintoshwith Atari's high-quality monochrome screenand plugged into a TV set for gamesRecentlythe Atari ST has been selling bundled with £400-£500 worth of games for £399At this price it has come under increasing pressure from the Commodore Amigawhich starts at the same price and attracts similar discountsThe Amiga also has a Motorola 68000512Ka built-in 3.5 inch disc drive and a mousebut it has much better colour graphics and soundThe Amiga's technical superiority counted for little when there were hardly any games for itand hardly any of them used its facilitiesBut after Commodore cut the price by £100and threw in the £25 add-on TV adaptorthe Amiga took off as a games machineNow it is at least as well supported as the STand its advantages are finally starting to countAtari has announced an enhanced STE range with graphics and sound facilities more like the Amiga'sbut at no extra costHoweverthe new facilities have yet to win any support from software housesand you would be surprised to find an STE actually on saleThe Amiga does not have as much serious software as the STnor does it have the equivalent of the ST's mono monitorHoweverit now has a reasonable range of productivity software word processorsdatabasesetcand in specialised areas colour graphicsdesktop video it is well aheadAt the lowest levelthe 520ST still looks slightly better value than an Amigawhich has an operating system not everyone likesBut for those willing to upgrade the A500 to one megabyteand add an A590 hard disc and a colour monitorit becomes a very attractive systemFinallythere's the Acorn Archimedes A3000which is by far the most powerful home micro availableInstead of being made in Taiwan Atarior Hong Kong Commodorethis is even made in the UKUnfortunatelyit does not have a lot of software supportand the price about £750 puts it beyond most people's reachIn value-for-money termsthe Sega looks the best buy among the games machinesthe Commodore 64 for a tape-based home microand

that multimedia is a sham the oldfailed teaching machine dressed up in new clothesITHINK if we are ever to see grand hokum in the Mac marketplace we'll see it in the months aheadas the M-word multimedia becomes the in thing to discuss in the 1990sMultimedia used to be defined as a fancy slide show that you sat and watchedThey were the ones with the bank of 40 computer-controlled projectors popular at expositions and amusement parksI remember a multimedia show in the Iran pavilion at the world's fair in SpokaneWashingtonin the early 1970sIt was about the Shah and the glories of the countryIt seems that while the definition of the word multimedia has changedthe baloney factor hasn'tNowadaysmultimedia means a computer using different mediasuch as a laser disca CD-ROMcable TV and who knows what elseThe most-talked-about end use is as a grandiose teaching machineYou remember teaching machinesdon't youThey were one of the biggest flops in educational historyNot that they didn't workit just seems that teaching machines have no charisma or charmI remember back when I was a college studentOne summer I went to California State University at Hayward and discovered that the school had a basement laboratory with about a dozen expensive teaching machinesYou could sign up for a series of courseswhich you could take at your own paceThe machine testedpaced and graduated youFor the life of me I can't remember what courses I took it was so boringSoon afterwards the famed Plato computerised teaching system was marketed by Control DataIt included special terminals and was the be-allend-all teaching machineI haven't heard about it for yearsThe hothot multimedia system out there right now was developed by Robert Abelthe noted Hollywood middleman and go-getter extraordinaireAbel has put together a demonstration system called Guernicawhich is a multimedia approach to learning about the famed Picasso painting that depicts the Nazi destruction of a peaceful Basque village by air attack during the Spanish Civil WarBased mostly on using a laser-disc player controlled by a Mac IIthe system allows a user to explore as the developers like to say the painting and its historyFronted by a HyperCard-like interface SuperCardactually the system lets users click and move from point to point on the painting and get lectures and comments from old boresex-mistressespeople who were theredopey ex-Nazi pilotsPicasso mavens and all sorts of expertsYou can jump from the history of the town to a backgrounder on Spanish danceYou can jump from that to something elseThe system is supposed to exemplify the potential of multimediaBob Abel and his palswhen they show this systemmake the mistake of using the word empower when describing the value of this approach to learningWith me that rings a warning bellsince it's one of those suspicious New Age buzzwords that always portend a scam or screwball notion such as crystal therapy or out-of-body travelThis systemhe saysempowers the individualThis is presumably because it allows you to explore the knowledge contained thereinThe promoters tell us that it's not like a book in which someone is telling you somethingThis new multimedia thingamajig allows you to discover things on your own through the wondrous use of the hypermedia approach to educationLinearity is deadBy the time the demo was over I was nearly nauseous at the presumptuousness of these notions and despondent over the lack of scepticism in the roomIn factnobody anywhere as far as I can tell has questioned any aspect of this nonsenseLet's make some quick points that need to be madeMultimedia education is nothing more than a new version of a teaching machinealbeit with real-time videoand teaching machines don't workJust try to learn French on your computerThis multi- media concept is to education what a demo program is to softwareTeachers teachComputers computeWith multimediapeople do not really explore and are not empoweredThe information provided on such a system is predistilled by the producersIt's not a base of knowledge but a subset that can be easily manipulatedAbelfor exampleis obviously a Democratas he slipped more than a few anti-Reagan barbs into his presentationVideo mediawith its powerful images used interactively for teachingwill find its niche as a propaganda toolI get a bad feeling when I see this thing in actionEspecially when I look around at the bug-eyed gawkers staringalmost hypnotisedat the imagesMultimedia issimply puta shamA fancy shambut a sham nonethelessIt's promoted by the natural-born hucksters within Apple because it has all the earmarks of something trendy and fashionableIt keeps people talkingIt keeps the excitement level highIt generates interest in Apple and it sells hardwareI'm not going to say that some of these projectssuch as Guernicawon't be fun to play around withassuming that you can afford to buy all the necessary and expensive hardware to add to your already expensive systemInstitutionsof coursewill be the suckers conned into spending the big money for all this equipmentIt will all end up in those grim audio-visual departments where it will eventually be auctioned off for peanuts during a cost-saving periodAnd for those of you who want to learn about Picassotry the library or go to a museum© Ziff Communications CompanyReprinted from Mac

Bangalore and Punewith two more expected in Chandigarh and Bubaneshwarto boost software exportsOne feature of these parks is the facility for real-time transmission of software code through dedicated satellite channels to clients in the US and elsewhereUnder a policy announced in 1986a 50 per cent rebate is provided on customs duty payable for import of hardware used for software developmentAnother feature of the new approach is that the software industry has been exempted from the licensing provision of the Industries Actthere are no constraints on the setting up of software
