The revolution the countryside needsChristian Wolmar says Britain is lagging behind in setting up telecottagesBy CHRISTIAN WOLMARTHE information technology revolution has left large swaths of rural Britain untouchedThe only computers in many villages are those owned by the teenage boys of the affluent to play their wham-bam gamesAshley Dobbsan engaging young entrepreneuris setting out to change that by creating a nationwide network of telecottagesThis clever namewith its neat evocation of new and olddescribes a concept which was developed in Sweden and is spreading to rural areas across the worldIn Mr Dobbs's wordsa telecottage is a room in a village filled with computer communications that can be used by local people to learn and workThe equipment consists ofperhapsfour word processorsa modema laser printer able to produce artwork-quality outputa fax and a photocopierSoftware programmes for desk-top publishingword processingaccounting and business planning are also essentialMr Dobbswho is chairman of Telecottages UKwarns possible users not to get bogged down with the technologyThe equipment is a tool to overcome what needs to be donePeople mustn't think that because there's a computerthey've got to think of a use for itHe reckons there are no shortages of possible uses farmers can use it to do their accountswomen with child-care responsibilities can work in their own time on the word processorspublicity material for local craftsmen can be produced and so onThis may sound utopianbut it has been borne out by the experience of existing telecottagesSo far about 100 have been establishedmainly in Scandinavia but also in Japan and several third world countriesAs the network expandsso do the usesThe first was opened in the village of Vemdalen in the remote forests of Sweden in September 1985The impactaccording to Henning Albrechstenpresident of Telecottages International who has been involved in their development since the outsetwas immediateBy holding open meetings for children and having the telecottage above the local storepeople of all walks of life came in small-scale entrepreneurs and their spousesshop assistantscraftspeople and childrenNow15 per cent of the village regularly uses the telecottage and at least 20 per cent has taken courses thereBritain is lagging behindNo telecottages have been establishedbut there are several initiatives in the offingThe most advanced is a plan for five in the north of Scotland which will be funded by the Highlands and Islands Development Board and British TelecomColin Pavey of British Telecom hopes that they will be running by the end of the yearTwo would be business-orientated and three would be community-orientated and located in schoolsWe are most interested in the idea of networkingsharing skills such as translation and using them for distance learningTelephone cables in the region are being upgraded to ensure they are capable of handling faxesMr Dobbs's more unlikely allies are the Women's InstitutesMost of the workers in telecottages and many of the users are womenHe saysIn villages there are many women with skills who aren't using them because of child-care problemsBut they are interested in workingUsers of telecottages are given the key and people can use them at any timewhich means that women can come in during the eveningearly in the morning or whateverHe is working on a scheme with the National Federation of WI to organise a competition to celebrate next year's 75th anniversary by offering 10 telecottages as prizes for its 9,000 branches and he is hoping the WI will establish a pilot telecottage near its college in DenmanOxfordshireWhile telecottages should become self-financing once establishedthey do need initial subsidyThe cost of providing the start-up equipment is in the order of Â£10,000 and Mr Dobbs thinks space is not much of a problemThere's usually the village hall or an empty shopHenning Albrechsten reckons that it takes three years for a telecottage to be able to function without subsidyIn Scandinaviawith their mixed economiesmoney is always availableafter a bit of persuasionfrom both local and central governmentIn Britainthe tight financial regime imposed on local councils and the reluctance of central government to take on any new expenditure makes it necessary to seek funds from the private sectorThe only government support so far has been a recommendation by the Rural Development Commissionpart of the Department of the Environmentto establish a pilot schemeMr Dobbs sighsThis is a typically British bureaucratic responseIt's been proved elsewhere that they workWe don't need pilotswe need telecottagesAs for the private sectorwhile BT may be happy to provide pump priming for five telecottages in the north of Scotlandit is not about to bankroll a nationwide networkNorit seemsis anyone elseThere is more at stake here than just bringing boxes of sophisticated equipment to remote areasAs Mr Dobbswho runs a country house restoration business from his home in MicheldeverHampshiresaysVillages are good places to live and workThe village is a fantastic institution and they make people happierBut the villages are dyingbecoming suburbs or dormitories where few people work but many sleepEmployment in agriculturestill the main rural industryfell from over a million in the mid-Sixties to under 100,000 nowThe aim of telecottages is to create well-paidflexible employment which will provide new jobs and make existing rural industries more competitiveThe emphasis on high wages is importantVillages are expensive to live in and if they are to become vibrant communities againlocal people must be able to earn enough to be able to continue living in themThere is a wider impacttooThe abstract talk of commuting by rail or road being replaced by information technology finds a concrete expression in the idea of telecottagesOnce people overcome their fears about computers and begin to use them in telecottagesthey acquire their own equipmentMany may eventually be able to work from home rather than commute to an officeHenning Albrechsten saysModern information technology has given people in remote regions the opportunity to overcome their worst handicaptheir distance from the centres of learning and developmentHe sees them as not only strengthening small communitiesbut also as actually beginning to reverse the population flows from the countryside to the townsBritainwith its growing traffic problemsseems an ideal place for the onset of this revolutionDespite Mr Dobbs's tireless effortsthis is another revolution which Britain is likely to be viewing from the sidelinesThe busy sex life of the nice maleChris Barnard explains why patting children on the head could help a man curry favour with their motherBy CHRIS BARNARDI REMEMBER once seeing a small girl remove a tin of soup from halfway down a display stack in a supermarketThe predictableand very satisfyingresult attracted the attention of a nearby assistantwho strode towards the offending infant with an expression of undisguised anger on her faceSuddenly she caught sight of the child's motherImmediatelyher expression and pace of approach changed and instead of the lambastingor worseshe had seemed about to delivershe gave the child a tolerant smile and began to pick up the scattered cansMost of us have experienced similar examples of such audience effectson behaviourplaying a game to perfection or otherwisewhen the team selector is presentfor instanceWhat you do depends very much on who might be watchingoften with good reasonPrudently taking cognisance of onlookers also turns out to be important in the social behaviour of other primatesFrans de Waalin his book Chimpanzee Politicsrelates a number of instances among groups of captive chimpsOne of the most striking concerned a male called Yeroen which was hurt in a fight with another maleNikkieFor nearly a week after the injurywhenever he was in Nikkie's field of viewYeroen would hobble pitifullygenerating an air of pain and dejectionAs soon as he moved out of Nikkie's viewhoweverhis demeanour changed and he walked normally without discomfortWhat Yeroen hoped to gain by his play-acting is not clearthough it may have helped to defuse further aggressionWhat is clear is that his behaviour was geared to the available audienceSome recent work on green vervet monkeys shows that audience effects can be important in other contexts in which their functional significance is a little easier to identifyAnne Keddy HectorRobert Seyfarth and Michael Raleigh at the Universities of California and Pennsylvania have been studying parental behaviour among captive vervets to see if males' parental ability affected the females' choice of mateTheir argument was that a male's potential quality as a parent might be important becausein many species of Old World monkeysmales form strong protective relationships with females and their youngwhich are crucial in reducing the amount of harassment and competition the young suffer from other members of the groupIn a number of speciesbonds between males and infants within a group may influence the chances of males mating with certain femalesIn baboons and Japanese macaques mothers resuming their sexual cycle are more likely to mate with males who have formed a relationship with their offspringDemonstrating parental behaviour towards infants may be a ruse by which low-ranking males are able to gain mating opportunitiesIf this is truethen males should respond differently towards an infant depending on whether or not its mother is arou.d to be impressedKeddy HectorSeyfarth and Raleigh tested this in an ingenious experimentThey looked at the behaviour of a male and infant under one of three conditionsIn onethe infant's mother was placed behind a clear screen so that the male and infant could see her and she could see themIn a secondthe screen was replaced with a one-way mirror so that the mother could see the interacting pair but could not herself be seenIn the final conditionthe mother was hidden behind a metal screen so that she could neither see nor be seen by the pair in the observation roomAfter half an hour in each casethe mother was released to join her infant and the accompanying maleThe experiment revealed a complex interaction between male and female dominance rank and visibility of the mother in determining male responses to infants and female behaviour towards malesMales of all dominance classes alphasubordinate and newly introducedwere less aggressive towards infants when the mother was in sightAlpha males were consistently friendlier than others towards male infants but were particularly nice if there was a chance that the infant was their ownSubordinate maleson the other handwere friendlier towards the infants of high-ranking femalesperhaps because their own rank might increase if they managed to associate themselves with such femalesThey were also friendlier towards female infants and those not fathered by the current alpha maleNewly introduced males were the least friendly to infantsIf being nice to infants is a way of currying favour with femalesthe benefits ought to be discernible in the way males were treated once the observer females were let looseThis seemed to be the caseOverallfemales were friendliest and least aggressive towards alpha malesregardless of their treatment of infantsSince females reap substantial protective benefits from associating with alpha malesthis is perhaps not surprisingWhen it came to subordinate maleshoweverthere was a strong relationship between how nice males had been to infants and how likely they were to be attacked by the femalenicer males fared betterIn the one-way mirror treatmentwhen males were unaware they were being watchedthey were more aggressive towards infants than in the clear screen treatment and as a result they received a drubbing from the femaleThe experiment thus suggests that while alpha males can trade on their superior competitive ability to obtain matessubordinates may have to wheedle their way into favourJudiciously patting junior on the head when mum is watching may be a useful way of doing itDr Chris Barnard works in the Department of Zoology at Nottingham UniversityCool solutions for hot climatesDavid Spark looks at tropical temperature controls for vaccinesBy DAVID SPARKWHEN smallpox was wiped out by a campaign led by the World Health Organisationthe campaigners were fortunate in that smallpox vaccine remains effective even when stored at relatively uncontrolled temperaturesVaccines against measlespoliowhooping cough and other killing infections prevalent in the third world are much more sensitivehoweverOn behalf of WHO and Unicefthe Consumer Research Laboratory CRLat HarpendenHertshas set up a special facility to test the equipment used to carry and store vaccinesCRL is allocating the equivalent of one person working full-time to the programmeThe CRL's main task is testing products for the Consumers' Associationpublisher of WhichmagazineSince 1978it has also tested equipment used in the cold chain' the succession of insulated containers which ensures that vaccines and other sensitive materials reach their destinationsoften isolated villages without electricityin good conditionon which WHO's immunisation campaign dependsIn 1983CRL helped to set up a test facility at the University of Cali in ColombiaWith more equipment coming on the marketWHO decided that Cali should concentrate on long-term research and that a full-time test facility was needed in EuropeOther laboratories test particular productsbut CRL is probably the only one which can cover the full range of equipment needed in the cold chainThe range is wideManufacturers dispatch vials of vaccine along with frozen carbon dioxide for cooling in largeinsulated cartons which must be tested for both strength and the efficiency of the insulationFrom the cartonsthe vials are unloaded into freezers and refrigeratorsThe Harpenden test facility will show how these stand up to the high temperatures of the tropicsThermocouples at critical points in each fridge or other piece of equipment will showthrough a computer print-outhow the temperature varies inside itOther items on test include the cold boxes in which vaccines are carried to villagessterilisers for the syringesstoves for the sterilisers and thermometersThe outcome of the tests is to be a book of approved equipmentwith details of performancepublished by WHO and UnicefAn obvious snag is the power cuts which are common in third world countriesThe CRL tackled this problem a few years agodeveloping ice-lined refrigeratorstubes of water surrounding the fridge compartment freezeif the power failsthe tubes keep the vaccines cool until all the ice has meltedDesigns are now being considered for small ice-lined cabinets for doctorssurgeriesso that doctors can have vaccines at hand to immunise any child who comes for treatmentA drop in voltage can be more serious than a power cutBelow a given voltagethe compressor in a refrigerator burns itself outSo there must be a voltage control unit to cut the power supply if the voltage failsand these units must also be testedKen Millsmanager of external projects at Harpendensays that in some developing countries the control units themselves were blowing upIt was thought that people tapping into the power supply illegally were sending high-voltage spikesdown the lineSo control units must be designed to withstand these spikesWe have to create the spikes hereto see how the units withstand themhe saysLast yearWHO presented CRL with another problemdisposing of

TOM WILKIEPLUTONIUMmore than any other element in the periodic tableis capable of arousing strong public emotionbordering at times on hysterical fear and loathingYet plutonium has been intensively studiedis well understoodand it decays away into harmlessness with a half-life of about 240,000 yearsConsider insteadliving creaturesThey interact with the natural world in complexill-understood ways ecology is the youngest scienceIndividuals may diebut plantsanimalsand micro-organismsare capable of reproducing and increasing their numbersIt is surprising thereforethat there has been so little public interest in this country in proposals to release into the environment livingman-made creaturesGenetic engineering has reached a point of such sophistication that there are clear benefits to be gained by releasing from the laboratory living organisms upon which have been conferred characteristics they could never have acquired through the normal processes of evolution or selective breedingFor exampleit is possible to snip through the genes of the vaccinia viruses one of which is the basis for the vaccine against smallpoxand stitch in some threads of DNA from the rabies virusTo the immune systems of the animals that it may infectthe resultant mutant virus will look as if it is rabies and so will trigger antibodies and generally stimulate immunity against the diseaseBut because the virus is reallyvacciniathe infected animal will suffer none of the ill-effects of rabies while becoming proof against infection by any realrabies virusWe stand to derive immense benefits from such releases of genetically engineered organisms into the environment providing they do what we expect them toBut there is a riskWhat ifby some unforeseen mischancethe vaccinia-rabies hybrid turned into an organism that actually spread rabies a disease that has always been comparatively difficult to catch with smallpox-like contagionThis scenario is unlikely in the extremeBut research over the past 40 years or so has revealed some great surprises in the natural worldGenes for resistance to antibioticsfor examplecan be swapped between micro-organisms of completely different species naturallyin the wildThere are almost certainly other surprises out there whichby definitionwe cannot speak about todayWe must try to ensure thatas a result of our own genetic manipulationthey do not turn out to be unpleasant surprisesSo the civil servants in the Department of the Environment are to be congratulatedThey have recognised that the laws to protect our environment need to be extended and revised to cope with the situation genetic engineering presentsThey havesensiblyrealised that the benefits from proceeding with caution outweigh the risks and there is no case for banning the practice outrightThey have recommended that anyone who intends to release a genetically manipulated organism into the environment should first seek consent of some competent authoritywhich must be satisfied that the proposed release is as safe as reasonably practicableRelease without consent will be a crimeregardless of the innocuousness or otherwise of the organismSo farso goodBut the civil servants have been vague when it comes to the detail of who is to be the competent authoritywho is to foot the bill for its work and any extra studies it may require before giving consentand how much of its deliberations are to be made publicMoreoverit seems as if the Thatcherite revolution has still not penetrated the dark towers of Marsham StreetFor there is no mention of how capitalism or the consumer can play their proper roles in determining the future of genetic engineeringThis is a serious omissionredolent of the old habits of thought that if only the public will trust Whitehallall will be wellOne of the first commercial products to derive from this biotechnology is likely to be genetically engineered tomatoesBy manipulation of the tomato's genetic blueprintscientists can alter the rate at which it ripensThis reduces the wastage due to damage in the journey from greenhouse to supermarket shelfThere is a dual benefit to the consumerbecause there is less wastagethe genetically engineered tomatoes ought to be cheaperand they ought to taste better tooWell thenLet the consumer make the choiceLet us make sure that the law to be put before Parliament this autumn requires genetically engineered products to be clearly labelled as suchAll the submissions to the Government from the biotechnology industry have called for greater public information about genetic engineeringso no one can object to giving consumers the chance to make informed choices as they push their supermarket trolleysIt is also right that consumers should pay the full price of the advantages they will enjoy as a result of genetic engineeringThe market has a mechanism for ensuring even that the potential risk of damage to the environment can be costedIt is called insuranceBefore the competent authoritysanctions any release into the environment it should stipulate that the releaser has to take out an insurance policy that will cover it for any consequential damage to the environment and necessary clean-up operationsThe cost of the premiums wouldof coursebe passed on to consumers in the price of the productsAfter allI am not allowed to drive a motor car without having proved my ability to a competent authoritythe driving test examinerBut once I have passed my testI am not allowed out on the road without insuranceIf such stipulations are made for so mundane a practice as motoringthey would seem to be reasonable precautions for protecting our environment for the rest of time from possible damage by man-made creaturesHow hot summers brought us stripped pinesScientists now believe a dramatic loss of conifer needles which struck West German forests may have been caused by the weatherrather than pollutionMartyn Kelly reportsBy MARTYN KELLYIN THE mid-1980s press stories about coniferous trees in German forests losing their needles were at their peakHalf a decade onglobal warming has become the biggest environment storyHoweverthe cause of tree blight has remained the subject of intense speculationbeing variously attributed to acid rain'ozonea mystery diseaseor any combination of theseBut now scientists believe the root cause of Germany's problems could simply be drier weatheralbeit aggravated by acid deposition and by the growing tendency for forestslike farmlandto be planted as monoculturesIn German foreststhere was a consistent pattern of damage to Norway sprucethe main species affectedbeginning with a yellowing of the upper surface of older needles and progressing to the death of the needle and a marked thinning of the crown of the tree as dead needles dropped offThe colour change from green to yellow suggested that the key may lie in chlorophyllthe compound responsible for photosynthesisThey followed this up to show that affected leaves had lower concentrations of magnesiuman important part of the chlorophyll moleculeThe disease theory was discounted early on by Reinhart Huttl of the University of Freiburgwho grafted affected shoots on to otherwise healthy treesThe mystery virusit was thoughtwould spread into the healthy treecausing that too to become diseasedIn factthe opposite was the casethe grafts became greenIf disease was not responsiblethen perhaps the answer lay with a physical cause such as air pollutionThere were two contenders for thisacid deposition in all its various formsand ozoneBernard Ulrich and colleagues at the University of Gottingen had proposed that deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds originating from industrial activity and power generationled to the release of aluminium from minerals in the soilThisin turnwas toxic to the tree roots responsible for uptake of nutrients such as magnesiumMeanwhilein laboratories in EssenBernard Prinz was suggesting that forest decline was caused by damage to foliage by ozoneanother gas produced as a by-product of industryHoweverSiegfried Finka colleague of Huttl at Freiburgfound that needles exhibiting the symptoms of forest decline showed changes initially in the vascular cells of needleswhich transport nutrients from the rootsFrom heredamage spread to the cells responsible for photosynthesisA needle exposed to gaseous pollutants such as ozoneon the other handshowed signs of damage first in the more exposed photosynthetic cells and only later in the better-protected vascular tissuesScientists working for Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board also found flaws in the experimental techniques used by Prinz and his colleaguesThe Germans used a machine which converted oxygen in air into the ozone which they used for their experimentsHoweverDrs Keith Brown and Mike Roberts found that nitric acid was produced from atmospheric nitrogen at the same time and that this was responsible for most of the damageWhen they repeated their experiment with ozone produced from pure oxygen they found very little effectMike Roberts and colleagues at the CEGB's research laboratories now think that air pollution plays only a minor role after all Forestryvol 62pp 179-222They agree that yellowing needles are caused by magnesium deficiencyHoweverthey are not convinced that the primary cause of this is toxic concentrations of aluminium released into the soil as acidity increasedInstead they see low concentrations of magnesium as a natural phenomenon exacerbated by air pollutionThe prime causethey believewas a succession of dry summers in the mid-1970sDrought resulted in decreased root growth and slower breakdown of soil litteran important source of magnesium for forest treesA further factor complicating the story is the trend towards monoculture of timber trees such as spruceThis increases soil acidityand encourages trees to form shallow rootswhich are less efficient and more prone to the effects of droughtIt was a slowing down of the spread of forest decline in the late 1980s that first pointed the CEGB scientists towards climate as the causeIn 1984foresters found that 20 per cent of the Norway spruce in West Germany's forests had lost more than a quarter of their needlesBy 1988 this had dropped to about 15 per cent of spruceand other species such as pine and fir showed similar improvementsIn other wordsthe symptoms were at their worst during the hotdry summers of the early Eighties and started to improve in subsequent wet summersIt iscynics might sayexactly the conclusion one would expect from scientists in the pay of the CEGBHoweverMike Robertsnow director of the Natural Environment Research Council's Institute of Terrestrial Ecology Southis quick to point out that acid deposition does exacerbate the problemin particular by washing magnesium from an already nutrient-poor soilDeposition of nitric acid in particular may contribute to the equation as a fertiliser as well as a pollutant per seThis is because the increased supply of nitrogen may encourage tree growth at a faster rate than the amount of magnesium in the soil can supportThe mechanism which Roberts proposes might be expected to work anywhere that spruce is grownHoweverforest decline was far more extensive in Germany and continental Europe thanfor examplein Britain and NorwayThis he attributes to our oceanic climateProximity to the Atlantic means rainfall in Britain contains quite a lot of dissolved salts from the seaSo although the wet climate in the west of Britain causes more magnesium to be washed from the soil than in Germanythis amount is far less than that added to the soil each year from rainfallThe conundrums surrounding forest decline were manyWhy was it so regional in characterWhy did pollution-sensitive lichens survive on affected treesDemonstrating climate to be the primary cause clears up many such problemsAt the same timeit gives foresters and the power industry a much clearer picture of how their activities are affecting the treesIronicallyMike Roberts is one person who welcomed the drought earlier this summerThe extra stress that it will have caused to forest trees in Britain and the continent will provide one of the first tests of his new ideas
