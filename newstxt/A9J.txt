Midwife at the birth of a stateTHE INTIFADA is a people's unarmed revolution against occupationIts two main slogansrepeated countless times in the directives issued by the underground leadershipare freedom and independenceIt has employed a dual strategy to achieve these two objectivesFirsta comprehensive civil disobedience campaign was begun by which people severedor minimisedall the contact points by which they were bound to the Israeli occupation authorityThis campaign included resignations of Palestinian officials from public poststhe boycott of Israeli goods and productsand the refusal to pay taxes and finesPartial and full strikesdemonstrationssit-insconventionsall these have in fact only constituted the outer layer of an inner mechanism of civilian rebellionThe secondand complementarypart of the Intifada strategy concentrated on the construction of an indigenous national authorityAs Israel's authority was being liftedthe population began creating an alternative authority of their ownPopular committees were established in villagesrefugee campssuburbsstreetsin fact in every communitySome headway was made in expanding self-sufficiencywhether through utilising more land for agriculturedeveloping home economiesor encouraging local manufacturers and productsVillages and refugee camps were thus being developed into liberatedor independentareasif not militarilythen at least psychologicallypolitically and infrastructurallyBloody clashes would occur whenever armoured units raided these villagesstorming through makeshift defensive road blocks and responding to rocks being thrown with live bullets and tear gasbut no sooner would these army units be gone than authority would revert to the village residentsPalestinian flags would be raised on minarets and church spiresroad blocks would again be erectedand life in all its aspects would once again be run by the local leadershipThe structure of the developing national authority has been both diffuse enough to prevent it from being destroyed by any one single sweep of arrests there have been more than 50,000 arrests since the Intifada's outbreakand coherent enough to allow for the existence of a unified resistance strategyWhile the entire network of popular committeeslocal institutions and the general public constitute the field commanders in the battle of civilian disobedience and of constructing a political infrastructurea rotating Unified National Command acts in the role of field-generalissuing a bi-monthly directive outlining policy and determining specific resistance programmesA high level of mobility in the structure allows for continuous interchange of roles and ideasand retains for the Unified National Command the closeness to grass roots that is required to make it truly reflect people's wishes and sentimentsTHIS expanded network of popular committees and institutions making up the Unified leadership is infused by tens of thousands of activists who belong toor identify withthe different factions of the PLOIn effectthereforethe PLO exists at all levels of organisation within the occupied territoriesThus the Palestinian national movement both inside and outside the occupied territories is an organic wholeThe pattern of the Intifada has been cyclicalThrusts of resistance mass demonstrationsresignationstax rebellionsetcwould come in crestsThe pattern is determined by a wide variety of factorsincluding what the Israeli army doesBut the relation is complexnot uni-directionalHarsh measures putting an entire community under an absolute curfew for a continuous lengthy period of timedemolishing homesuprooting olive or citrus treesphysical intimidation and terror tactics employed by raiding army unitsshootingkillingcutting off water or electricity supplies and telephone links to villages or townsmass arrestsintimidatory interrogation techniques can either create a temporary lull or activate an eruptionThe army never knows which it will beIt is as if it is walking through a minefieldThe wave-like pattern of the Intifadaits pains and sufferingsare all reminiscent of the process of birthThe metaphor is aptas Palestinians regard themselves as engaging in a process of giving birth to their independent Palestinian stateThrough their revolutionthe masses are both mother and midwife to the birth of this stateThe Intifada is the midwife of freedomThrough itPalestinians are struggling on a daily basis to shake off Israel's authority and to construct their ownThe struggle reflects a revolution in mass consciousnessby which people have come to realise that ideas and aspirations must be embodied in manifest acts if reality is to be changedThuswherever one looksone finds people engaged in the construction of the blocks that will make up the Palestinian stateIt is a conscious effortThe masses are being engaged in the craft of state-masonryIn this process of state buildingmany stages have been coveredThe Declaration of Independence issued by the Palestine National Council PNCon November 15 last year constitutes a major landmark along this roadIts significance lies in its double messagethat the aim of the Palestinian struggle is the establishment of Palestinian independenceand that this independence is regarded as being not at Israel's expenseThis has been a constant theme of Intifada policythat we wish to build Palestinenot to destroy Israelthat we wish to achieve freedom for our peoplenot to deprive others Israelisof itthat we wish to protect and save lives oursnot to endanger the lives of others IsraelisIn one of several Intifada leaflets written in Hebrew and addressed to the Israeli soldiers on duty in the occupied territoriesthe message was repeatedSoldiergo homeReturn to your family and childrenBe with them in peace so that we may remain with our family and children in peaceWe do not wish to harm youor your stateWe wish to be unharmedin our own stateHow can the process of state building be developedIf the PNC Declaration of Independence constituted a major landmark in this processthe time has come to embark on another major stepthat of declaring the setting up of a state or government structureAN ESCALATION of the Intifada in this direction would serve two purposes at onceFirstit would consolidate the structures of the developing national authority which is competing to replace the occupation authoritySecondit would consolidate the image and essence of the Intifada as a constructivenot a destructiveforceNaturallyto embark on such a step is not necessarily to succeed immediately in realising itRatherit is a challengeIt will be a further challenge to Israel's occupationconceived in the image of earlier challenges of the IntifadaBut it will also be a challenge to usPalestinianssummoning us to work more energetically towards the idea's fulfilmentIt would be a natural extension of the Intifada's dual strategy towards disengagement from Israeland the corresponding process of state buildingIt would further naturalise and legitimise the evolving skeletal form of Palestinian independenceIt would provide the multitudinous popular committees and activities with a more advanced form of organisation and structureIt would enable better planning and performanceIt would maximise civilian tactics of resistance and defuse the natural potential for violencecontaining and eventually eliminating the marginal but intrusive phenomenon of collaborator activation by Israeli security authorities and collaborator execution by local PalestiniansIt would create a further fact that would put Israel on the spotIsrael's reactionhowever hostilecould only further our causeArresting or deporting the tens of thousands of Palestinian professionals who would be employed in perfectly apoliticalharmless and humanitarian jobs can only further isolate the Israeli GovernmentHalf-way measures can only imply half-way successA modus vivendi would also imply successIn generalour policy should be to proceed with building our state block by blockwithout waiting to be given a gift of it through negotiationsWe should regard negotiations rather as the means by which we could establish formal agreements between our state and IsraelSuch agreements can range from the issue of borders to the issue of free wave-lengths for our future television and radio networksIn the meantimewe have the capacity to bring coherence and organisation to a whole range of activitiesfurther consolidating the institutional linkage between the

significancethe Israeli leadership positively refused to do soDefence Minister Yitzhak Rabin forecast that it would be all over in one or two weeksA leading Israeli journalist was soon to ascribe that misjudgment to the historic blindnessthat has always bedevilled Israeli governments and publicensuring that developments whichto outsidersmight seem all but pre-ordained come as a very disagreeable shock to themIt was particularly unfortunate this timeThe Intifada was perhaps the most convincing refutation ever of the time- honouredcomplacent dogma that the status quo can last as long as we want it toTrueit was not so spectacular as earlier assaults on itsuch as the Arab-Israeli war of 1973so it is hardly surprising that Israeli leaders should have so contemptuously dismissed itso patently failed to understand its revolutionary importthatfor the first timethe enemy was offering the prospect of the civilisedpeacefulnegotiated settlement for which Israel had clamoured since its foundationIn a very timely bookIsrael's Fateful Decisionspublished shortly before the Intifada broke outthe Israeli scholarGeneral Yehoshavat Harkabiwrote that for a settlement to be possibleboth sides must first renounce their respective dreams or grand designsfor the Zioniststhe redemptionof all the Land of Israelfor the Palestiniansthe liberationof all the territory that once was theirs and thereby end what he calls the absoluteexistentialnature of the struggleThe moderateson both sidesmoved by their common fear of the hellthat otherwise awaits themhad to gain the upper handThat is precisely whatwith the Intifadathe Palestinians have doneTwo years onthe Intifada shows little sign of abatingIt is a cliche to say that it has become a way of lifeand that the stone-throwing is only the publicpropaganda face of a whole politicalsocialeconomic and psychological transformation the Palestinians' own perestroika which both sustains the Intifada and lays the groundwork for the eventual transition to statehoodIt is deemed unthinkable that it should stopToo much hopeto much sacrificehas been invested in itTwo years onthe Intifada's aim the two-state solution -remains moderateandby and largeso do its non-armed methodsYasser Arafat sticks doggedly to the infinitely tortuous peace processnever saying noto the Americanseven though it is obvious to him that what the Israelis want is surely unique in the history of peace negotiationsto both set their agenda and to appoint the other side's representativesThe basic trouble is that the Palestinians' historic espousal of moderationhas not won its indispensable and commensurate Israeli responsePolarisation in Israel there certainly isbut if one applies the same broad definition of moderateand extremistto the Israelis as one does to the Palestiniansone cannot but conclude that precisely the reverse situation prevails among themthat it is their Jibrils and Abu Musas or religious fundamentalists in the Hamas mould who hold swayThe moderatesare a small minoritywhile into the category of extremistsfalls that whole band of opinion ranging from the tougher section of the Labour Partythrough the Likudto the outright fanaticsnationalist and religiousof the far rightIt is the outcome of a process whichfor Harkabihas its origins in the Israelis' overwhelmingintoxicating victory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli warIt was thenjust as the first signs of Arab flexibility appearedthat in Israel the notion took root that the renunciation of grand designswas erroneous in its minimalismAnd judging by the public discoursethe government's negotiating strategyand the army and settlers' day-to-day behaviour in the territoriesthe Intifada has made many extremistsmore extreme than everThere is the growing allure of apocalyptic solutionsHarkabi described the idea of a transferthe mass expulsion of Palestinians as just the kind of project that is calculated to lend the struggle its absoluteexistentialcharacterOne year after the Intifada begansome 49 per cent of the population favoured itaccording to the latest pollthe number has now risen to 52 per centAS FOR the government's negotiating strategyHarkabi forecast that nothing would scare the extremistslike a readiness to talk from the other sideShamir and company persistmulishlyin their contention that Arafat will always be Arafatthusaccording to the Deputy Foreign MinisterBenyamin Netanyahuthe PLO saysflat outthat it seeks Israel's annihilationThey don't say it on American television and maybe not in Frenchbut they say it plainly in Arabic every dayThere is no evidence for thiswhich is probably why the quality of their argument can fall so lowwith Shamir saying of perhaps the most influential and long-standing of PLO moderatesKhalid Hassanthat when you see his face you know he cannot be trustedIfas some Israeli moderatesargueterrorism always was a marginal questionit is certainly infinitely less serious for Israel's future than the mass popular unrest of the Intifadabut by continuing to lump everything they can such as children throwing stones under its general rubricthe extremistsseek to de-legitimisethe Intifadaand evade any necessity for looking at its real causesThe ordinaryeveryday behaviour of army and settlers flows quite naturally from a government and a public which hold such viewsIt is the ingrained contemptthe impulseapparently deliberately inculcatedto humiliate whichin the eyes of enlightened Israelisis perhaps more revealingmore frightening in its ultimate implicationsthan all the well-documented brutalitiesIt is completely and increasingly normalfor soldiers to break into houses and mix food with cementto leave excrement lying aroundto turn the male population out in the middle of the night to clean the streets and sprinkle them with rose waterSettler children shout at bus driversRun them overthey are ArabsGraffiti saysWe shall eat the Arabs out of tinsThose Israelis whom this behaviour most appals have long been likening it to the earlier stages of Nazisman analogy that found startling vindication with the recent disclosure that some units in the occupied territories draw on Nazi precedents for their own self-imageone calling itself the Mengele detachmentand another the Auschwitz companyPalestinians who have tried to reason with the Israelis about the meaning of the Intifada find all this dispiritingBut is hardly less distressing to Israeli moderatesnot merely because they find oppression of another people morally wrongbut because of its dangerously divisive effect on Israeli society itselfOne really wonders whether the wilder fringe of Israeli extremistsloathe their own moderatesany less than they do the PalestiniansAccording to a recent poll58 per cent of Israelis believe there will eventually be civil warIt is hardly surprisingin such a climatethat Israeli moderateslike their Palestinian counterpartsshould now look so earnestly to the third partythe USas the only possible way of saving Israel from itselfBut will itSo farit seems to the Palestinians that the US listens less to the moderatesof both sides than it does to Israel's still very powerfulif increasingly defensivechampionsthe Jewish lobbyits knee-jerk supporters in the Congress and the mediawho are still ready to parrot the Israeli extremistline that Arafat isindeedstill ArafatIt is not as if the Administration really believes that any moreWeary of Israel's ceaseless importuningit recently produced a long and scholarly confidential reportwhich concludes thatsince Arafat told the UN General Assembly last December that he recognised Israel's right to exist and renouncedterrorismthe PLO has not been speaking with forked tonguesand its declarations have for the most part been consistentregardless of the media in which they appearYet despite that authoritative vindicationthe moment the PLO makes what might at first sight appear a slight regression to its old-style militancythe US promptly joins the Israeli extremistsin pronouncing it a serious setback for the peace processUnder pressure from Congressrenouncingterrorism is no longer enoughthe sincerity of the conversion has to be proved tooThe Palestinians dohoweveracknowledge signs of change for the better in US JewryCongress and the Administrationand that it is up to themselves to push them forward in much more effective ways than they have managed hithertoIF AT long lastthanks to US pressure on Israelthere is realdiscernible progress in the peace processthe Intifada will probably continue much as it isIf notit is unlikely to change its aimsbut it may very well change its non-armed methodsSo far the seniorunderground leadership is against thatBut among the younger ones impatience is growingIt is partly sheer anger at the daily brutalities and humiliationsit was just such spontaneous personal vengeance that inspired a young Palestinian to force an Israeli bus over a precipice last summerkilling 14 peopleIt is partly the cold calculation that the Israelis must be made to realise that there canin the endbe no such thing as the low-costoccupation they like to imagine there isThere will be no terrorismPalestinians forecastand no systematic armed struggleagainst Israeli soldiersbut there will probably be a growth in occasionalselective operations like the recent killing of two soldiers in Gaza intended to add a judicious edge of real pain to the innocuous rebellion of the stonesBut that kind of carefully calibrated escalation could easily get out of handA key feature of the Intifada is thatafter long years of trans-frontier or inter-state conflict between largely faceless enemiesit brought the conflict back to where it essentially belongsto Palestine itselfThat is why it is very effectivebut also whyin the absence of a settlementit is very dangerousFor it is an ethnic conflictbetween peoples who see each other at close rangeIt is naturalHarkabi warnedthat such conflict should always get worseEntering the third year of the Intifadait is more than ever clear that time is of the essencehow to keep it going long enough at a level which does not yield to the temptations of ruinousreciprocal escalationbut still disturbs the outside world enough to get them to bring the Israeli extremists to heelPatiencepatiencepatienceexhorted Arafat this weekWe shall not tirewe can go on another two yearsand another two years after thatBut patience is becoming hard to sustainIf the Israeli extremistsare allowed to persist in their grand designtheir Palestinian counterparts will eventually succeed in re-imposing their ownwith the moderatesincluding Arafat himselfreverting to the belief that Zionism remains the all-or-nothingdemoniac creed they used to say it wasIt will becomeon both sidesan existentialstruggle once againThe Intifada may be the first chance for a civilised settlement
