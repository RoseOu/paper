Religious education encrusted in myths and fantasiesProfessional religious education teachers like Marjorie B Clark Points of Viewtodayare doing valuable work in many secondary schools in trying to separate the facts about religion from the myths and fantasies with which they have become encrustedGood RE teaching is about the historical facts and the literature of the main world religions and it allows the young to study the beliefs and attitudes held by the adherents of these religions and also by humanistsUnfortunately there are many secondary schoolsespecially in the denominational sectorwhere this strictly educational approach is not followedIn primary schoolsclass teachers are expected to be polymaths and to devote 10 per cent of their time if they obey the official guidelinesto teaching a detailed programme of religious and moral educationThis is drawn up by the curriculum committeewhich argues that since Goddeathsuffering and the purpose of life are all at the heart of religionand since children sometimes ask questions about themthe class teacher should not only teach about these mattersbut be subject both to assessment procedures and to official inspectionBut we all have our own ideas about the answers to these big questions and it ought to be left to the discretion of class teachers to allow their pupils to learn about life's problems in their own time and at their own paceThis attempt to codify religious and moral education in the primary school is a mistakeit will unnecessarily tie the hands both of teachers and of education departmentsAs for worshipor religious observance as the legislation calls itI agree entirely with Marjorie B Clark that compulsory acts of worship can never be educationally justifiedThe trouble is that the Scottish Education Department disagrees with both of us and insists that religious observance must not only be reinstated but also reinforcedThe department is now laying itself open to serious educational criticism on several grounds1It is undemocratically imposing its will on reluctant schools2It has failed to understand the vital distinction between education and indoctrination3It is failing to make it clear to parents that the law gives them full rights to withdraw their children from religious instruction and religious observanceHoly Bat-pooTROUBLED times for the Church of EnglandHard on the heels of the furore about women priests it now has to contend with something equally knotty the fatal British tendency to be kind to animalsAny animalIn this case the appalling British bat which is fouling up churchesIt's probably best to declare an interestWe're not all bat loversPut to the testwe suspect the anti-bat vote would be a close second to the anti-rat factionIn facttake out David Attenboroughstill fondly remembered in his early television days standing knee-deep in the bat-droppings of centuriesand a few hundred assorted enthusiastsand this countrygiven the chancewould go solidly anti-batBut a few hundred enthusiasts were all that was needed to make these dirty little flying mice a protected speciesfree to flit andwellleave droppingswherever it takes their fancy under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside ActCottage and village hall ceilings come high on their list of favourite dropping placesAnyone who has had such a ceiling sag under the strain will sympathise with this week's debate in the Church of England synodDistracted vicars want action against the furry little pestsand quite right tooWhether they will be allowed to evict their unwelcomeunsavourytenantsfrom belfries and elsewhereis another matterBut it is encouraging that Bats in Churchessponsored byLord help usthe Bat Conservation Trustis countered by the Movement Against Bats in ChurchesThat is genuine progressIt's time we took a stronger line with wild-eyed enthusiasts who don't think through the full consequences of their soft-hearted feelingsWhen are we going to get a Society for the Prevention of Birds orfailing thatat least a society for the prevention of seagulls and starlingsOnly be thankful they don't live in lofts and churchesVoting religiouslyBOB

StateKeeping the faith but losing a way of lifeFrank Farragher reports from Galway on the impact of the Digital job lossesTHE PEOPLE in the west of Ireland city of Galway are no more religious than the nextIn the past year they have lost a bishop in a love-child affair but over the past few days they had more faith in prayer than in their politicians when it came to saving the Digital computer plantGalwaya tourist and university city with a population of 55,000regarded the Digital plant as part of the landscapeSecuring a job in Digitalopened in the recession-free days of the early 70swas thought to be akin to getting a position in the civil serviceonce inthere foreverThe word on the streets of Galway last week was that hardware manufacturing with its 800 jobs had gone by the waysideLast-minute trips to Boston by the employment ministerRuari Quinnand local mayorPadric McCormackwere regarded as a face-saving exercise something to be seen to be doneAt last Friday's meeting of Galway County Councilindependent councillor Joe Brennana public representative noted more for his faith in God than in liberal manproposed a prayer to save DigitalWe should look to the Holy Spirit to guide us for good newsIreland should go back to the past and pray and concentrate on GodThe number of unemployed is increasing and human beings have failed ushe saidThis morning the 780 employees of Digital in Galway will wake up with a hangover after a night's mourning and stare into an uncertain futurewishing that some divine intervention could be called upon to extract them from their present straitsThe Digital workforce in Galway was a loyal and dedicated one which placed its faith in the company ethos of trust and co-operationPeople's lives were Digital orientedmany had been there since finishing second level school or universitylife outside Digital was unthinkableThe Digital thinking permeated through all walks of life in the Galway regionDigital workers were always good for a car loan or a mortgageperceived as being in securewell-paid jobsGood workerswith high self-esteemnot the type to renege on a £60,000 mortgage or a £10,000 car loanThe term Digital mortgagein Galway was synonymous with the middle to upper end of the housing marketWith an average three-bedroomed semi-detached fetching in the region of £55,000the typical Digital purchaser often dipped into the £70,000-£80,000 marketA frightening thought now for former workers looking at interest rates of close on 14 per centEven in the days when every dog on the street knew about the impending Digital closureemployees of the company were reluctant to talk publicly about their plightThe whole company ethos of keeping everything within the plant and of not talking to television or papers survived even when all seemed lostThe workers' faith has not been repaid this week in a region which had escaped many of the severe job cuts which had hit other citiesNow just 350 software jobs have survived the multinational hatchetOther multinational companies like Thermo-KingBairdNorthern Telecom and Crown Control still survive in a city which has other major employers in third level educationhospitals and the tourist industryDigital was always regarded in Galway with the same respect and awe as Cinderella had for her fairy godmotherThe model plantmodel workers who didn't need a unionjobs for lifebut this fairy godmother forgot all about the happy endingThe 450,000sq ft factory on the edge of the world famous Ballybrit racecourse Digital sponsored the richest race in the summer festival had an influence which permeated into every corner of life in the cityIn human terms the loss adds up to 800 jobs in Digital and 2,000 more depending directly on orderssupplies and serviceIn financial termsthe loss is estimated at £100 million per annum to the Irish economyNot far from Digital a firm set up by the Rehabilitation Institute employing 60 peoplesome of them handicappedsupply packaging

contract with DigitalIts bossMichael Cunninghamnow fears that some of his 71 staff will have to be let goThe car hire company Johnson Perrott at any one time has several hundred cars at Digitalthe list goes on and onEarlier this weekworkers at the Galway plant flashed an electronic message to the Digital HQ in MaynardBostonUSAIt was desperation stakesa last throw of the dicebut workers in Ballybrit agreed to take a 10 per cent cut in wagesall to no availThere is no bitterness towards Ayr in GalwayEveryone knows that in the contracting world of producing computer hardware it would always be a case of dog eat dogUnfortunately for Galwaythe perception is that Michael Heseltine had an Alsatian teamed up against an Irish poodleUntil about three weeks ago there had been a belief among Digital employees in Galway and the Industrial Development Authority in Ireland that Digital's plant in Ayr would lose outBut in the words of the former Irish minister Bobby Molloywho represents Galway City in the Irish ParliamentA major change occurredLast night in the Digital pubsit didn't really matter any more whether Heseltine had offered a major defence contract inducement to the companyThey saw little point in diagnosis after the patient had been placed in the coffinYesterday a dream died in Galwaya dream which had been born in the headyoptimistic days of the early 1970s when bright-eyed youngsters leaving school walked in the doors of the Digital plant and more often than not were given a jobBy 10am on the morning of 25 February1993tears had taken the place of hopeWinners and losersThe sign outside the Digital factory at Ayr yesterdayA love at odds with its faithJoan McAlpine talks to an angry priest about the Catholic Church's attitude to homosexuals among its ranks I believe that homosexuality is a gift from GodTo deny that gift is to deny God's willsaying His way isn't good enoughIt's a type of blasphemyif you likeBernard LynchTHE Roman Catholic Church has never been the most liberal institution in its views on homosexualityIt condemns gays as sinful and evilSo it would seem safe to assume that life as a gay priest might be something of a tortured path if not a contradiction in termsBut some homosexuals in the church especially in America have exchanged guiltyfervid prayers for support groups and gay pride marchesThey are now asking that Rome recognises or at least does not condemn the love that dare not speak its nameAngry priests and nuns argue that the hardline stance on chastity hampers the church in educating young people about AIDSas well as caring for those who have the diseaseBut those who raise their heads above the vestibule are seldom treated with Christian charityThe story of Father Bernard Lynch demonstrates how the wrath of the bishops can strike those who bare their souls to homophobic scrutinyIn May 1988Lyncha high profile campaigner for gay rightswas indicted on five charges of child abuse in New York CityHe was accused of molesting a 14-year-old boy whom he had been counselling while working as a school chaplainBut the prosecution case collapsedQuestions were raised over the fabrication of evidenceIt was strongly suspected that the softly spoken Irishman had been framedHe was acquitted on all counts after the court heard the boy in questionby then a young manhad been put under pressure to testify by the FBI and the district attorneyIn his book A Priest On Trialpublished this week by BloomsburyLynch sets out the transcript of the trial and accuses the church of colluding in his personal crucifixionBy the time of his trialFather Lyncha former missionary in Africahad been working with gay Catholics in the city for nearly ten yearsHe had been openly critical of his own archbishop's defence of discrimination against homosexuals in church employmentA trained counsellorhe has ministered to 600 people with the disease to dateOnly six remain aliveIn 1986 he founded an AIDS Ministry with Dignitya group of lesbian and gay Catholicsand became a member of the mayor of New York's taskforce on AIDSThe city introduced legislation that year forbidding discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientationThis was in marked contrast to the Vatican's letter of the same time saying gays weredisordered in their nature and evil in their loveLynch remembersThe reaction in the city and throughout the gay world andindeedamong many reasonableintelligent people was incredulityHow could the churcha church supposedly based on the love of humankindissue such a horrendously offensive documentWe were devastatedAfter he spoke out against the letterLynch was ordered to take a year's sabbatical in Rome even though by this time his ministry was receiving worldwide media coverageThe Society of African Missionaries made him sign a document promising to be Faithful to church teaching in matters of faith and moralsIt was at this time he was indicted on child abuse chargesOf all the charges brought against the gay community there is none more common than the assumption that gay and paedophile are one and the samePeople can hardly be blamed for this misconception when one considers how often the mediaparticularly the tabloid presscome out with itSome gay people molest childrenjust as some heterosexual people dobut this is because they are emotionally and psychosexually damagedwhatever their sexual orientationAfter his acquittalhe says he was less concerned at the action of the authoritiesthan by the failure of his church to help himThe church's attitude to Lynch stands in marked contrast to its harbouring of some Catholic priests who have in fact been guilty of child abuseIt transpired that the Archdiocese of New York had allowed the state to defameprosecute and condemn menot only without offering me any aidbut also keeping from my attorney any information which might have helped meYet Lynch remains a member of the churchHe is on leave from his orderand currently works in London as a counsellor for people with AIDSUp until the time of his trialhe felt obliged to deny his own homosexualityNow he freely admits to being gay and to having had a stableloving relationship with another manHe continues to campaign for the right of Catholics to be openly gayBut how can this be a realistic demand in an institution which condemns any physical pleasure outwith marriage for heterosexuals as well as homosexualsAnd how can gay priests reasonably expect acceptance when celibacy is demanded of heterosexualsThe desire for marriage and a family results in thousands of men leaving the priesthoodI believe that homosexuality is a gift from GodTo deny that gift is to deny God's willsaying His way isn't good enoughIt's a type of blasphemyif you likeHe does not believe celibacy should be demanded of priests whether gay or straightRadical views like this seem unlikely ever to be accepted by the cardinals who dictate the dominant conservative teachingThe Roman Catholic Church is distinguished by its hierarchical nature and its insistence that traditionand the papal interpretation of God's willis as important as scriptureBut Lynch believes his church is like a large boat which should be able to take his views on boardThe Catholic church is universallike the United NationsIt can take in all sorts of peopleIn Latin America and Africaas well as this countrythere are bodies of faithful Catholics who don't adhere to church doctrineHe insists the Vatican's teaching is at odds with its congregationsIn the US78 per cent of Catholics believe in the ordination of women while 48 per cent approve of blessing the union of two people of the same sexThe church's teaching on contraception is widely ignored by CatholicsLynch says the church's attitude to sexuality should be reviewed in the light of HIV and AIDSThe church ought to take its courage in both hands with this diseaseIt should say If you cannot adhere to the moral dictumthen at least only engage in safe sexIt's not enough to say don't have sexThe church has enormous power when it comes to educationThere is no room for soft pedallingThis is a life and death issueHe believes the church must go further and examine its whole attitude to the rich mosaic of sexualityMinorities have an important role to play hereGays in the churchfor exampleare like the canaries in the Welsh minesleading the way for othersGiven his viewsone might be surprised that Lynch remains a priestThe popular expectation would be the humiliation of defrockingIn factthis is a very rare eventOnly an attack on the nuts and bolts of belief such as denying the existence of Christ merits this punishmentLapsed priests remain priestsbut tend to be unemployable in their clerical functionsLynch is on leave from his orderBut he does say Mass when invitedoften by people with AIDS who are not Catholicbut would like spiritual support from a like-minded personGiven the radical nature of his viewsone must ask why he remains a priestHis experience of Catholicism from his earliest years up until his trialseems to have been bound in oppressionself-denial and guiltAs a child in the west of Irelandhe was a member of two Jansenistic religious groupsHe recalls that the Dominic Savio clubdesigned to safeguard bodily purityforbade its members from even watching a screen kiss at the Saturday matineeIn his book's conclusionhe writesIt has been my sad experienceagain and againespecially in my Aids ministryto witness the damning effects of my church's institutionalised God on young people's soulsThe church has in effectpoisoned their lifeline to GodWhy does Lynch remain in an institution which seems to deny everything he holds dearWhy not just leave set up home in a more tolerant spiritual pewAfter allthere are many trendy Anglicans who hold similar viewsI could not leaveOnce you are a Catholic you remain a Catholicwhether you become a Buddhist or an atheistYou still think in the way you have been educated as a childAnywayshould you move out of your country because you disagree with the politics of the governmentNoyou stay and try to change itDONALD MACLEODHoly allianceAn item in your Diary 16 Februaryis objectionable to myself and Bob Kernohan only in the lack of style that is employed in tittle-tattle and irony nowadaysWe both come from an older school of journalismSome of the facts were rightI am a Christian-Marxisttotally unreconstructedBob Kernohan would not object to being called a very conservative ConservativeI am not proposing him for Moderatorbut I am pressing his caseUnless the Church of Scotland has redefined the meaning of ordinationI remain a minister in function although I chose to demit statusSo why the holy alliance between left and rightI doubt if Bob Kernohan and I have ever agreed on anything except personal integrityHe is a man with something to say and an immense intellect with which to say itHe could start a debate about a church that in order to survive will be radically different from the one we knowHe might even get media coverage beyond the protectedprecious and self-indulgent God slotsVirgin territory for miraclesMYSTICAL manifestations seem to be in the news at the momentwhat with the imminent publication of a book about recent sightings of the Virgin Mary in a London tower blockSister Marie or Sofia Segatis Paprocki Orvid Puciato to her friends claims the Madonna appeared at her sixth-floor flat in Queen's Park and delivered dire warnings about coming cosmic eventsDetails are sparsebut the events seem to involve the three kings of ArabiaSir David Frost and the Queen's press secretaryYou may laughbut already deposits worth £30,000 have been put down for the book and at least 5,000 people have telephoned bookshops to express an interestIndeedmystical manifestations are not unknown even in our own hard-headed Scottish capitalIan Lang's visit last week to address the Edinburgh University Politics Society was marked by a phenomenon whicha few years agomight have attracted the interest of Arthur C ClarkeJust as Lang was rising from his chairclaims a letter in Midweeka burst of sunlight filled the stained glass window behind himAfter the audience had accustomed their eyes to the flashthey beheld a subtle and beautiful sightAll around the head of the minister-with-the-film-star looks was a nimbusor brightly-shining haloOf courseit is premature to propose Mr Lang to the Pope for canonisationButwhen the times comeshis proposers look as if they will have an incontestable piece of evidenceAfter allBlessed Lang of Gallowaymay be the only Secretary of State to have walked all over waterSomething funny about this poster protesting against Mr Lang's visit to the Edinburgh University UnionPerhaps it's the editor of Living Marxism who should think about going back to an educational establishment
