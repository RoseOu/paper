PUB ROCK Pint-sized rock nrollersJim White steps back in time to sample the fare at his localBy JIM WHITEAccording to those on the inside trackRaggahouse is the latest fad in clublandThis hybrid mix of reggae and hip hop follows acid jazzBelgian New Beat and acid swing the wholly forgettable contribution of Jive Bunny as the sound to set disco feet tappingBut no matter how often the archives are ransacked for old genres to bastardiseyou don't have to be at the forefront of style-making to foresee that very few clubs will be swaying this time next year to Pub AcidHip MaltnHopsor Sweaty Backroom HouseThe grunge and grime of pub rock has been credited with many thingsincluding the invention of punk rockbut being remotely fashionable isn't one of themAt the Bull & Gatenext door to the Town & Country Club in London's Kentish Townthe management has been promoting pub rock in a back room with adjoining outer bar for almost as long as the form has existedLast Thursday night the pub presented a triple bill described in Time Out magazinethe Baedeker Guide for London pub rock fansas melodic pop rockAt the door the man taking the money was dirtying patrons' hands with one of those rubber stamps no-one thought existed outside student discosWhen pressed he was unable to give an accurate answer why this was necessarynor why the stamp read Do Not BendFor your £3 entrance feeyou were invited into a dingey outer barpacked to capacity with strange anarcho-punk types who only appear at nightAt the bar a leather-clad schoolboy was buying a pint of lagerserved in a plastic beakerOccasionallythe decibel level would rise from the merely conversation-stopping to Heathrow proportionsThis was when somebody opened the door to the inner sanctum where the support band was playingHerein a room even estate agents would have difficulty describing as anything other than small20 people clung to the perimeter walls as a man with a Chris Waddle haircut hammered out some old rock clichesOne fan sang along and plucked at an imaginary guitarbut he turned out to be the roadieAt the end of their set the roadie applauded wildlyand everyone else wandered back to the barNo wonder the Waddle-alike kept his eyes firmly shut throughoutThe headline band was called Girl With A Blue GuitarThey were what is known as indie-popperswhich means that they play guitars rather than synthesiserswear black leather biker's jackets and have a female lead singer with peroxide blonde hairThe twist here was that the guitarist was also female her guitar was blueand the singer had an Australian accentThe crowd had swollen to about 70 by nowstanding in a respectful arcas if the stage was protected by a sci-fi forcefieldA couple of girls danced enthusiastically and several others tapped their feetA friend of the band weaved in and out of the crowdrecording their performance on a video cameraIt was the only indicationapart from the price of the beerthat this wasn't a decade agoFor the playersthere was the prospect of returning to their day jobs with £50 in their pocketsfor the landlord there was a healthy night's takings and for the crowdeven those who had stayed in the bar all eveningthere was a nasty ringing in the ears the next morningThat's the thing about pub rock everyone goes home happyPUB ROCK Pint-sized rock nrollersJim White selects the best of the London pub venues and gigs in the weeks aheadBy JIM WHITEGENERAL TIPS A general rule for pub rock patrons is that the quality of music will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the beer except at Finsbury Park's Sir George Robey where an excellent music policy comes complete with a decent pint of GuinnessAnother rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stageit will be a good eveningThere are two types of pub rock occasionsthoselike the one described abovewhere the band is likely to suffer from agrophobiaand those where the pub is so crowdeddeath through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get outThere is no half-way houseIf it's a comfortable evening's entertainment you're afterstay at home with the
