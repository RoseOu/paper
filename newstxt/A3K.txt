decision-makersAllison Flight fills in the background to a planning applicationBy ALLISON FLIGHTTHE planning system is designed around the idea that people should have a say in what happens to their immediate surroundingsBut how do you find out about whether a planning application has been made in the first placeWhether you are proposing or opposing an applicationwhat is the best way to influence the decision that is eventually madeFinding out about an applicationUnder section 28 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 the planning authority usually the local council is supposed to advertise certain planning applications in the local newspaperThe proposals covered are development in a conservation areaworks to a listed building or which affect the setting of a conservation area or a listed buildingand developments in Areas of Outstanding Natural BeautyThe planning authority also has to advertise locally any proposals involving large buildings those more than 20 metres highor any unneighbourly usessuch as a casinoscrap yardcemetery or slaughterhouse and put up a notice on the site itselfSome local authorities publish a list of all their new planning applications in the local paperOften they circulate these lists to local conservation and amenity groupsresidents' associations and subscribersRing the local planning authority to find outWhen the council receives a planning application it often consults people who might be affected such as neighboursother residents and community groupsThe consultation process usually takes the form of a letter describing the application and inviting you to come and look at a copy of the application and any drawings submitted with itThere is no legal obligation on the council to carry out any specific consultation processHoweverif the authority concerned has a code of practice dealing with consultation and fails to carry it outthe Local Government Ombudsman may find the authority guilty of maladministrationThe planning department of a local council keeps all current planning applications on a register which is available to the publicAs a result of recent changes in the copyright lawsif you cannot see the application at the council's offices then you can ask the planning department to send you a copy of the application and the drawingsBut this can be expensiveso find out firstIf there is a particular site for which you want to be kept informed of any future developmentyou can ask the planning department to tell you if it receives an application affecting itHow to comment on a proposalWhen you make observations on a planning application you should only comment on planning groundsThis will exclude many issues which are probably important to you personallysuch as the fact that a development will reduce the value of your property or spoil your viewThe council will take a number of factors into account when making up its mind whether to give a development the go-aheadThese will includeDoes the scheme comply with the policies contained in its local planIs the proposed use compatible with the surrounding areaWill there be enough parking provision and will the development cause traffic problems once it is completeThe design of the buildingparticularly its bulk and sizeAny loss of daylight or sunlight to adjoining propertiesThese matters will be looked at before a firm decision is takenThe council can negotiate with the applicant in advance to ask for changes to the scheme and these can result in new drawings being submittedBe carefulif you were asked by the council to comment on the original applicationit may only inform you of these new drawings if you specifically askIf you are particularly worried about a proposalit may be possible to make an appointment with the appropriate planning officer for a meetingeither in the council offices or on siteso you can explain your objections in personThe planning officer is an employee of the council who handles the application up to the point when it is put to the planning committeemade up of elected councillorsfor a decisionHe or she will usually make a recommendation to the committee about what its decision should bebut it does not have to follow this adviceThere is a set time allowed for the council to receive comments on an applicationThis varies but it will be stated in the consultation letterIf you have not had time to objectcontact the planning officer and ask for extra timeHe may agreeand he is often the one who decides what issues will be dealt with and whenThe committee may only meet once a monthAll comments should be in writing and these letters are made available to the public when the case is decidedIf the council receives a large number of letters about a developmentthis will give it an idea of the strength of feeling involved and it is much better than a petitionMany councillors take the view that it is easy to drum up names for a petition although you may have more impact ifsaythe petition is restricted to immediate neighbours of the developmentNeverthelessjust because a lot of objections are received does not automatically mean an application will be refusedIf the development is large or controversialit may be worth forming an action group to give local opposition a focusIf you are applying for planning permission yourselfinclude a letter stating the planning merits of your proposal and also any personal circumstances you think are relevant for examplethat you are building an extension for an elderly relativeIf you think your application will be unpopular such as a mini-cab office or a bed and breakfast hostelyou can ask the council for a personalor limited periodplanning permissionso the council can review the situation at a later dateHow the planning committee makes up its mindWhen the council has considered all the factors involvedthe case will either be decided by the chief planning officer under delegated powers if it is a minor or uncontroversial issueor it will be decided by the elected councillors at the planning committee meetingTo influence the decision in your favourcontact the planning department to find out whether an application is to be heard at committee or dealt with under delegated powersIf the case is going to committee you are able to see the agenda and relevant background papers three working days in advance of the meetingwhich will be held in publicThis right is given to members of the public under the Access to Information Act 1985If there is an application you feel strongly aboutfind out the names of the councillors on the planning committee from the planning department or memberssecretariat' of the councilWrite a letter stating your objections or support for the application and send a copy to every member as well as the chief planning officerContact your ward councillor and try to interest him or her even if they are not on the committee they may be able to influence the councillors who will take the decisionThey may also be able to tell you some of the preferences of those councillorswhich can make a big difference to how you lobby themThe actual meeting will be open to the publicSometimes a limited number of people will be allowed to address the councillors for or against a proposal at the meetingThis is fixed in advanceOften there is a limit on numbers and it works on a first-come-first-served basisTalk to the planning officer beforehandWhether an application is dealt with by the council in committee or under delegated powersyou should receive a letter stating the outcome of the case if you submitted

intend to build a bungalowFirstthey have to sell their present housea two-bedroom cottage in the centre of the townAs is the case almost everywhere elsethe market in Devon is depressed and selling has not been easySo instead of waiting indefinitely for a buyerthey have decided to try selling their house by auctionIt comes under the hammer at 2.15pm on the 20that the Barnstaple MotelWe accept that we might not get very much for itbut on the other hand we could get moresays Julie WidlakeWe've been waiting to move for a long timeand we need the money to build the new houseTheir South Molton cottage guide price £44,000-£46,000is one of more than 20 lots to be put up for sale at the Barnstaple auction by Bristol and West Property Servicesand one of more than a hundred which the building society subsidiary will be auctioning in eight West Country venues over a three-day periodBristol and West claims these auctions will help to bring some action to an otherwise slow marketand says it was overwhelmed by the response from people wanting to sell in this wayAuctions certainly speed up the house-buying processOnce the hammer has fallenthe successful bidder for a house must exchange contracts immediately and pay a depositCompletion normally takes place four to eight weeks later and there is no opportunity for second thoughtsAs the Bristol and West explainsif a bidder does not sign the contractthe auctioneer can sign on their behalfFrom the vendor's point of viewthe house is actually sold once a successful bid is madesays Graham Harrisondirector of Bristol and West Property ServicesMany people have suffered from sales falling through and from house-buying chainsand some of our vendors feel that now's as good a time as any to sellFrom the purchasers' point of viewauctions can also be attractive if slightly nerve-racking as you wait for bidding to start for the house of your dreamsThe problem is that normally potential purchasers have to incur the expense of undertaking surveys and arranging mortgage financewithout any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling priceNot surprisinglyseveral estate agents report difficulties at the moment in attracting enough serious biddersWith an auctionyou've got to be certain that at least two buyers are there who can commit themselvesand the difficulty is that buyers who can proceed are few and far betweensaid David Phillipa director of Yorkshire estate agents Dacre Son and HartleyBristol and West hopes that by arranging collective auctions it will be able to overcome this problemIt is also guaranteeing mortgages at 1 per cent below the normal interest ratefor endowment or pension-linked policieson several of the houses up for salean interesting and innovative service for would-be bidders mortgage surveys will already have been undertaken for these housesThe building society will be staffing a mortgage desk at each auctionand says buyers could arrange finance there and thensubject of course to proof of income and statusObviouslyhoweverBristol and West hopes to hear from interested people in advance if only so it can gauge the likely demand for each property before the auction startsWe're trying to smooth the path for purchasersand streamline the systemsays Graham Harrisonpointing out that live telephone bidding will also be available for those unable to attendHoliday homes and commercial property have been included among the lots to be auctionedAlthough collective property auctions take place regularly in London often primarily for investors rather than house-huntersin country areas the more typical auction will be just for one houseand as likely as not will take place in a nearby pub or village hallIn factcountry auctions are often the nearest many villages get to live theatreThe locals come for the entertainmentand to see who's buying into their villageobserved one auction-goerPub landlords are usually only too happy to provide free accommodationIt's very exciting and gets the adrenalin goingsays David Phillipwhose firm usually undertakes auctions in the Otley areaOnly certain types of property normally come to auctionhoweverTraditionallycountry cottages and houses which have unusual or unique features or are in need of a lot of renovation may be auctionedif only because valuation is likely to be difficultSometimestoohouses have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirements of trustees or executors auctions provide adequate proof that the property has been sold at the going market valueand protect trustees from future claims of negligenceLess happilybut for the same reasonrepossessed houses are often auctionedAnyone considering selling by auction needs to be aware that the costs involved will be higherAdvertising costs and any expenses incurred in hiring premises are normally passed on by the estate agents to the vendorwhether or not the auction results in a saleIn additionagents may charge slightly more commission than usual for a successful saleIn Bristol and West's forthcoming auctionsa set fee of £375 plus VAT will be charged to everyone entering property to sellwith its usual agent's commission about 2 per cent plus VATcharged on top when sales are madeWe accept that we could lose the money we've paid to go to auctionbut that's a risk we're prepared to takesays Julie WidlakeThe secret of a successful outcome depends partly on setting the right reserve pricea task the auctioneer undertakes in conjunction with the sellerNormallythe reserve is set only days or hours before the auctionwhen the agents will already have a good indication of how much interest has been shownToo high a reserve price can mean no saleand disappointment all roundYou need to understand what your clientsexpectations are beforehandsays Graham Harrison of Bristol and WestAgents and their clients may also have the dilemma of deciding whether to accept any offers made prior to the auctionInevitably they do not always get it rightPeter Crowthermanaging director of a Leeds business centrerecently bought two semi-detached stone cottages in Bramhopeon the outskirts of Leedsat an auction in the village pubHis successful bid was for £190,000 although he had made a higher prior offer which had been turned downOn the other handsometimes the drama of the auction and the competition between bidders can have the opposite effectAnother recent auction in Leeds saw a run-down stone farmhouse without water or other amenities finally fall under the hammer for £330,500Success is by no means guaranteed at auctionsays Graham
