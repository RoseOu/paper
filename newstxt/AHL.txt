NidderdaleNorth Yorkshirein addition to 30 black redstarts along the coastScientists click over a way to save dolphinsby Greg Neale Environment CorrespondentHUNDREDS of thousands of dolphins could be saved from death thanks to pioneering work by British scientistsThey believe they have found a cheappractical means of preventing dolphins entangling themselves in monofilament drift fishing nets the walls of deathbelieved to be responsible for killing large numbers of dolphins off Cornwall this yearBut their work is hampered by lack of moneySo far they have received nothing from the Governmentlittle EC assistance and are running out of funds donated by individuals and industryThe researchersheaded by Dr Margaret Klinowskaa Cambridge biologistand David Goodsonan expert on acoustic engineering at Loughborough Universitysay new data shows that plastic sound reflectors attached to fishing nets can warn dolphins of hazardsData to be published shortly draws on experiments including observations of Freddythe dolphin that has been living off the Northumbrian coast for four yearsUsing equipment donated by Racalthe scientists have analysed recordings of the clickingdolphins make while huntingObservations of Freddy led them to conclude that dolphins use sonar while huntingThey emit an intensebroad-band clickor pulse of soundEchoes of the signal alert them to possible preyat ranges up to 80–90 metres in shallow watersMr Goodsonwho became interested in the sonar capacity of dolphins after hearing one while swimming off the Welsh coasthas experimented with various shapes of sound reflectorsThe most promising is elipticalabout 3½in longThe theory is that its internal air pocket will bounceback the dolphin's sonar signalregardless of the direction of approachLast autumnDr KlinowskaMr Goodson and their team put the theories into practiceIn the Moray Firththey placed a headline barrierfrom which they had suspended reflectors at two-metre intervalsThe movement of dolphins around the barrier was observedusing electronic equipment to monitor sonar activityThe results exceeded our expectationssaid Mr GoodsonDolphins swimming near the barrier altered their behaviour to avoid itthe resultthe scientists believeof them detecting sonar echoes from the reflectorsDr Klinowska said thatalthough it was necessary to be cautious about the findingsa combination of reflector devices and some modification of fishing gear might reduce deathsBut the Moray Firth experiments were only possible after the naturalist Dr David Bellamy helped secure a donation from the Co-operative Wholesale SocietyOur work is being delayed simply through the lack of fundingsaid Dr KlinowskaThe scientists hope to raise £100,000 through an appeal by Windsor Safari ParkDonations can be made to the

MATTHEWSA LOT OF PEOPLE are very sceptical about Darwin's theory of evolutionI know this after answering questions for two mind-boggling hours on a phone-in about the mysteries of science for Piccadilly Radio in Manchester last weekThere were the inevitable late-night nutters ringing in after a beer too manybut many of the questions revolved around the evolution of humansThe sheer implausibility of the emergence of humans from primordial slime in just three billion years is clearly too much for manyThe stock response to such qualms is that it is difficult for humans to grasp a time scale of such lengthThiscombined with the process of survival of the fittest which promotes the emergence of ever better creatures is what enables the miracleof human life to developButover the past few monthsI have been investigating something that makes such abstractions far more impressiveBack in the mid-1970san American computer scientist called John Holland hit on the idea of using the theory of evolution to solve notoriously difficult problems in scienceA classic example is the so-called Travelling Salesman ProblemImagine a carpet salesman whose patchcoverssay10 different townsHe wants to visit them allwhile minimising his time on the roadHow does he find the quickest routeTrying out all the different permutations of routes is clearly impracticalthere are 3,628,800 different ways of making a journey between 10 townsDr Holland realised that the basic idea behind evolution could helpThis would mean starting with a random set ofsay20 possible routes between the townsand calculating how long the journeys would beOne would then throw out all but the best that isthe shortest routesand keep these for a kind of survival of the fittestOne then breedsa new generation of routes by combining features of the best onesand randomly altering a few details as a form of mutationThis next generation of routes is then assessedand the whole fitness-ratingbreeding and mutation process repeatedThis Darwinian recipe for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem has proved incredibly effectiverapidly finding the shortest routes between scores of townswhere the number of possible routes is so large it could never be written downIn recent monthsI've been having a lot of fun using a similar biologicalapproach to crack a certain type of codeI started off with a random set of guesses as to how to break the codeand then checked each guess to see how good it was at turning the garbled message into EnglishWhat has amazed me and the friends I've press-ganged into watching the process is the speed with which the genetic algorithmsniffs out the way to decode the messageIn just a few minutesthe encoded gibberish on the computer screen starts to turn into plain EnglishFranklyit's rather spookyBuilding this genetic algorithm for code-breaking has certainly left me in no doubt that evolution is quite capable of performing miracles in no time at allIndeedI now find it puzzling whyafter all this timeevolution only produced something as dismal as a humanIN THIS week of the electionwe can expect to see Peter Snow doing his impersonation of John Cleesewith lots of statistics produced by computers accompanied by the timeless phrase it's just a bit of funI hope he doesn't suffer the same fate as those who first used a computer to predict an election's outcomeIn 1952CBS Television used Univacthe first commercial computer system in Americato do a Peter Snow for the Stevenson-Eisenhower election battleAt about 9pm on election nightwith just seven per cent of the votes inUnivac predicted 438 electoral votes and 43 states going to Eisenhowerand just 93 electoral votes and five states to StevensonUnivac's masters decided the machine had a screw loosemost human pollsters were predicting a close raceThe programmers were called in and told to fiddle with Univac's brain to make the prediction more realisticUnivac's watered-down prediction went out at 10pmBut as the night wore onit became clear that Univac had been right all alongBy midnightits masters had thrown in the toweland put out the computer's original forecastThe final result was 442 votes and 39 states to Eisenhowerand 89 votes and nine states to StevensonAs the legendary CBS reporter Ed Murrow drily observedThe trouble with machines is peopleReviewBy gummother knew best all along There are times when a doctor's diagnosis is no match for widely held beliefs about illnessDr James Le Fanu tells two cautionary talesBy DR JAMES LE FANUTHERE have been two instances recently where populist concepts of health and illness much derided by doctors have been partially vindicatedThe first concerns teethingFor as long as I can rememberit has been standard medical teaching that teething of babies causes no symptomsNelson's classic Textbook of Paediatrics says that teething can lead to intermittent localised discomfortand little elseHowevermothers bringing their babies to surgery attribute a bewildering variety of symptoms to teethingincluding poor sleepingrefusal to feedearachediarrhoea and feverThe situation calls for considerable tact on the doctor's partThere seems little point in saying that teething is a non-existent condition which has never reliably been shown to cause any distressSo a sensible compromise is to examine the baby to see if there is any obviously treatable cause for its symptomsand if there is not to advise a treatment for the temperature or diarrhoeaor whatever the baby is suffering fromIt now transpires that mothers have been right all alongResearchers at the Tel Aviv School of Medicine asked 46 of them to take their babies' temperatures and monitor their symptoms in the two weeks before the eruption of their first toothSure enoughits appearance was associated with a distinct feverwhich in some babies rose as high as 38C 100.4FThere are complex reasons why doctors deny what can so easily be demonstratedbut in the case of teething I am sure there is a strong historical element of guiltFrom the 16th centurydoctors widely accepted that teething was responsible for a multiplicity of childhood illnessesincluding convulsions and deathand recommended a protective measure that babies' gums should be lacerated to liberate the deathBesides being extremely painfulthis often resulted in a nasty infection leading to many problems that they attributed to teething itselfThe custom fell out of favour at the turn of this century and I suspect thatas a reaction to the damage the treatment causedthe contrary view that teething is harmless has been passed down through generations of doctorsThey have been equally disparaging about low blood pressure as a causeamong other thingsof tirednessfainting and dizzinessalthough their colleagues in GermanyFrance and several Mediterranean countries not only recognise the condition but actually treat itThe British view is uncompromisingexcept where low blood pressure is secondary to some underlying conditionsuch as shock or septicaemiait is a non-illnessIndeedthe lower the blood pressure the betterbecause statistically it reduces the subsequent risks of stroke and heart attacksThe symptoms attributed to low blood pressure areit is arguedessentially neuroticwith a high prevalence among young womenThere isit must be saida lot to be said for this robust viewThe unhappy and depressed frequently complain of tiredness and lack of energy andif they are young womenthey invariably have a blood pressure in the lower range of normalYetthe European doctors are also rightDr Simon Wessely at the Institute of Psychiatry has recently shown quite convincingly thatindependent of underlying psychological problemstiredness is associated with low blood pressurePerhapshe suggestsBritish doctors should be less condescending towards their Continental colleagues and refuse the evidence of the efficacy of their treatment for this conditionTHE New England Journal of Medicine tells a grim story in which seven people were infected with the Aids virus by a man after his deathSurgeons operated on a 22-year-old American male who had died from gunshot woundsTissues and organs were transplanted into 50 recipientsUnfortunatelythe donor must have been infected with the Aids virus just before his deathand over the next few years seven of his beneficiaries have become HIV positiveIt is a contemporary tale of medical misfortune which paradoxically illustrates quite dramatically the remarkable achievements of modern medicineHad Aldous Huxley introduced a sub-plot into Brave New Worldwhere the remains of a dead man were cannibalised to save the lives of 50 strangersonly for them to succumb to a lethal virus hidden in his tissueshis readers
