already doubtful because of tendonitis of the right wristbut Graf's appearance is now in doubt because of a foot injuryLess than 48 hours after the world No.1 had lifted her third French Open titledoctors in Paris revealed that she picked up the injury towards the end of her quarter-final win over Jennifer CapriatiThe problem is believed to be either an Achilles tendon strain or a stress fracture of the right footShe had painkilling injections for the easy semi-final win over compatriot Anke Huber and a smaller dose for Saturday's final against Mary Joe Fernandezwhich went to three sets and lasted a gruelling 2 hoursThe 23-year-old is returning home to Bruhl in Germany for several days restBut her agent said she was still hopeful of defending her Wimbledon titleAgassi was seeing a specialist in Seattle in a bid to beat the injury which kept him out of the French OpenGraf's withdrawal would be a major blow to Wimbledonwith Monica Seles whom she deposed from the top of the world rankings in Paris still recovering from the knife attack in Hamburg on April 30But with the top two players sidelinedit would present 36-year-old Martina Navratilova with a golden opportunity to lift her 10th singles crownIf both Graf and Agassi were to succumb to their injuriesit would be the first time in the Open era that both reigning singles champions have not returned to defend their

in an unhappy relationship in which the child suffers tooNina RowlandsNo judge is going to award access away from the mother while the child is still dependent on herby JANET TANSLEYWHEN it comes to parenthood more and more women are deciding to go it aloneFOR some a broken-down relationship means they have no choiceOthers simply long for motherhood without the commitment of marriage or a steady relationshipBUT what happens when the father of the child demands accessWhat are her or his rightsIT'S a dilemma facing more and more womenThey want the baby but not the fatherThe reasons are manyEither the man she is with is not ready for a long-term commitmenthe may be violent and she wants to keep him away from the childOr she may simply have opted for motherhood without the father which normally completes the traditional setEither way they are a growing groupespecially on Merseyside which has many unmarried mumsExplains Deborah Wintlean advice worker and counsellor for Liverpool One Parent Families TrustThere are a number of unmarried mums on Merseysidemany of which we see coming into the TrustA lot more women are making the conscious decision not to get marriedfor whatever reasonThey want the child but not the relationship that goes with itThe way we see marriage has changedPeople decide not to get married but to go ahead and have children anywayFor some the relationship has broken downothers have never been with the fatherBut today's more liberal attitudes mean they have the freedom to do thatIt's far better to be a lone parent than be in an unhappy relationship in which the child suffers tooThere can be problemswomen may have to work harder to maintain a standard of livingbut support normally offered by the father can be obtainedsays Deborah23from family and friendsDeborahfrom Aigburthherself is a lone parent with a three-year-old little girlRebeccaso she knows the problems women faceOne is if the father wants to see the childFew women know where they standSays DeborahWe have had women in this situation and it can be disturbing for them and the childThe father may have been violentthe woman might be involved with someone else who has taken on the role of fatherWhen this happens they don't know what to do or where to goWe asked Liverpool-based Goldsmith Williams' solicitor Nina Rolandwho writes the Echo Woman Extra's LE Law column where these women stand when it comes to the question of accessSays NinaThe immediate answer is that if the couple are not married the mother has all the rights the father has noneHe would have to apply to the courts for any accessAnd he certainly can't demand to see the child when and where he wantssay every weekendYet while the mother has all the rights invested in herthe courts will be amenableSays NinaUnless there is a valid reason why the man should not see the childthen the courts will probably grant some sort of accessIt may be once a week or once a fortnight perhapsbut it wouldn't be a lengthy period until the baby is older and more independentNo judge is going to award access away from the mother while the child is still dependent on herBut it is important that the baby doesn't become a tug of love in between two warring parentsAnd it is always better to settle out of courtsays NinaIt is far better for youand the childto come to an agreement outside the court systemthan get involved in a legal battleBest for child If you have a good reason why you don't want the father to see your baby then you will be able to put your case to the courtsAt the end of the day you have got to decide what is best not just for you but for your childRememberthe new Children's Act gives them rights too and a court will usually consider that it is in the child's interest to know both parents where possible and reasonableNot surprisinglythe access granted can often depend on whether the child is a girl or boySays NinaIf it's a girl the courts often deem she needs her mum's influenceBut boys are thought to need a man aroundDeborah addsWhile the legal situation makes things clearer this is obviously an emotional problem and it can help to talk things throughSometimes there may be bitterness between the mother and father but we can help put things into perspectiveIt may better if the child can get to know both parents where possibleeven though many unmarried mums are happier on their ownNew worries for Wire bossBy Nick Walker WARRINGTON coach Brian Johnson returns from holiday next week facing a contract headacheSeven Wire stars have refused

problems than those produced by last winter's disastrous tour of IndiaGraham Gooch insisted there would be no wholesale changesfor the second Testwhich begins at Lord's on Thursday weekbut the captain and his fellow selectors will have been dismayed by the worrying lack of technique and substance shown by most of the team at Old TraffordGooch and new boy Peter Such were the only England successes as Australia won by 179 runsAnd Gooch has clearly run out of excuses for a team which has lost six consecutive TestsHis magnificent second innings 133plus a top score the first time aroundhas served to magnify the glaring deficiencies in the batting line-upGooch said of his batsmenYou can't bat for themIt's the way they perform that countsAnd on the bowling side he admittedPeter Such had a dream debut in helpful conditions in the first inningsbut we then struggled to make inroads and our bowlers did not look penetrative in their second inningsWe have to improve if we want to get back into this seriesGooch has complained too many times now that the players needed to compete more keenlyAlong with team manager Keith Fletcherthey both continually insist that the England team is packed with quality playersBut performances have been consistently below par for too long and drastic action needs to be takenEvery Australian player made some contribution to a fully deserved victoryThey looked

season at The MonsBootleANDY GRAY is sadly amiss in his comments on the Clough signingFor one thinghis obsession with tactics has led him into an absurd devaluation of the merits and achievements of Peter BeardsleyWhat's worseit seems to have blinded him to the facts of Liverpool historySince the warevery spell of Anfield success has been set or kept in motion by the signing of a top-class striker-cum-providera player who not only scored goals but also made them for his colleaguesThere was Stubbins in the late 40sSt. John in the 60sKeegan from 1971 to 1977Dalglish from 1977 to 1987and Beardsley from 1987 to 1991The creative stimulusas well as the goal scoring examplesupplied by such players brought the best out of fellow strikers like LiddellBalmerHuntArrowsmithToshackHeighwayRushAldridge and BarnesSensibleI therefore take issue with AndyGiven due attention to other departments of the team plus average luck and good management rare commodities in recent timesI admitI see nothing wrong and everything right with the purchase of Nigel CloughHis signing is wholly in line with Anfield traditionIn my view he is the one player

divisionTranmere chief executive Frank Corfewho led a powerful delegation to today's meetingsaid We are absolutely delightedThis was one of the biggest issues facing the cluband our success will mean a great deal as we strive to strengthen our overall standardsFor the last few years we have been seriously handicapped by the fact that our second team have been unable to compete regularly against quality oppositionIt is terribly important that young players are able to progress upwards through a good competition before being pitched into the LeagueIt is also desirable that members of our senior squad not in the first team are able to continue playing at a reasonable leveland they have not been able to do this in the pastUp to now Tranmere reserves have had to play in the Midland Senior Leaguehaving had several previous applications to join the Pontins League rejectedLast season they won it for the second year in succession with some easeand without their players being

be restarted at a later date at the point it was called offThe resolution will be put to the League's annual meeting on Fridayand Rovers hope the fact that it now has official supportwill be sufficient to have it passed despite anticipated oppositionAngerThe reason for the resolution is the club's simmering anger over an incident last seasonwhen the match at Swindon was abandoned after 61 minutes due to a floodlights failurewith Tranmere leading 2–1Under League rulesthe game had to be replayed in its entiretyand Tranmere lostto suffer a mighty setback in their drive for promotionChief executive Frank Corfe saidI thought the whole thing was a disgraceI know some people accused us of whingeingbut it was ridiculous that they were able to benefit from something that was entirely their faultIt was their groundand their floodlights that failedThey had even been giving trouble during the morning and had still not been put rightPowerSwindon benefitted from having two large gatesand I thought it was unbelievable that our supporters were expected to pay twiceAs the rules stood at the timethe League had no choice but to order the game to be replayed over a full 90 minutesUnder our

has kept himself fit during the summercan expect a sudden telephone call inviting him to join either the Lions or England on tourThe list of casualties in New Zealand has become truly horrificwith one player following another onto the plane homeand plenty of others needing a bit of attention like the 12 stitches Stuart Barnes had put in his face after the game with SouthlandThere is no suggestion that this latest spate of injuries has anything to do with deliberate dirty playbut one gets the impression that things are now so tough that the referees just leave the sides to fight it outwhile awarding penalties on a quota basisAll good funand I don't suppose it has anything to do with the fact that an All Black can now earn up to £45,000 a year without sacrificing his status as an amateurAces are low for WimbledonIT looks like being a distinctly sub-standard Wimbledon this yearThere are question marks hanging over the appearance of major grass court stars like Andre Agassi and Steffi Grafwhile both Monica Seles and Guy Forget are already sidelinedThe probable absence of both Graf and Seles is particularly disappointingbecause they have dominated the women's game for the last two yearsWho knowsthe evergreen Martina Navratilova may now be poised to add to her staggering total of more than 160 major titlesAs for the menit is hard to look beyond Pete Sampras and Stefan

7–8pmWelsh ace Gibbs joins casualty list after victoryBy Terry CooperSCOTT GIBBS became the British Lions' latest casualty in the jinxed centre positions during a messy 34–16 victory over Southland todayThe Welsh centre will be out for 10 days after bruising ankle ligamentsand his injury means the Lions have only one fit centre Jeremy Guscott after the injuries last weekend to Scott Hastingswho is returning homeand Will CarlingIt is becoming increasingly essential that Carling recovers from his strained thigh muscle in time for Saturday's first Test against the All BlacksThere was further bad news on the injury front both stand-offs received head woundsRob Andrew went off with a bang on the nose which needed an X-rayalthough it was later revealed that there was no fracturewhile his replacement Stuart Barnes had 12 stitches in a head wound caused by a stray bootThe Lions ran into similar refereeing trouble as in Auckland in the second matchconceding 15 penalties during the second halfStampingThe opening half contained several episodes of foul playincluding a dreadful double stamping by Mark Tinnock on Richard WebsterMike Teague felt compelled to punch the wild Tinnock away and was in turn punchedReferee Mike Fitzgibbon did not have a clue what had happenedbut fortunately New Zealand's best refereeDavid Bishopwas on the touchlineTinnock was penalisedbut in England he would have been sent offLions captain Gavin Hastings saidIt was very frustratingThe referee obviously made up his mind that penalties were to be givenLions manager Geoff Cooke saidIt was pretty boringWe cruised to a big lead without getting out of bottom gear and continuity was difficult to obtain after half-timeWhen the Lions should have been exerting control from a position of 31–3 ahead with 28 minutes leftit was Southland who did the scoring and the Lions' only score in that final period was a drop goal from Tony ClementHastings collected four penalties in the opening halfthree of them from 50 yards down the strong windThe Lions scrum was consistently wheeledbut they put their act together twice in the 21st and 30th minutesa pushover try being prevented illegally and the referee awarding the Lions a penalty try that Hastings convertedThen the Lions controlled a scrum-five which turned into a maulallowing lock Andy Reed to scoreBut easily the best Lions' movement of the match came when Tony Underwood and Gibbs made breaks to allow Clement to go on a weaving run for a converted trySparklingBut by this time Southland had started scoringSimon Culhane kicked two penalties and the wings Jimmy Cormack and Phil Johnston were sent in after sparkling movementsHow Gooch put on a display of naked courageCAPTAIN FANTASTICJOHN MajorGraham Gooch and Graham Taylor have had a lot in common over the last weekwith the latter two probably coming under even more public pressure than our beleaguered Prime MinisterIt is a measure of the importance we now attach to sportthat although few either know or care who the latest Minister of Sport iswe pay our national team bosses far more than members of the CabinetEverything seems to have gone wrong for poor old Gooch since his marriage broke upculminating in that bizarre dismissal on Mondaybut he does at least have one big advantage over the other members of the trioUnlike themhe does have the chance to come out and lead his troops in personpurging any doubts about his leadership with the sheernaked courage of his performanceWhatever one feels about his captaincy at Old Traffordnobody could possibly do other than admire a man who went on to bat for more than five hoursimmediately after suffering a truly horrific hammering in the fieldUnfortunately all the evidence of the last 12 months suggests that while Gooch's batting ability remains invaluableEngland would do better under a more imaginative skipperif one could only be foundMike Gatting will probably get the job this winterbut I doubt if either he or the two younger contendersMike Atherton and Alex Stewartare quite up to the task of masterminding a major English renaissanceIf it's any consolation to GoochAllan Border was in a very similar situation not so long agoand he came through with flying coloursUnfortunatelyat the time he was a good deal younger than Gooch is nowGRAHAM GOOCHunder pressureNo loyalty from GlennGLENN Hoddle's almost instant decision to walk out on Swindon and join the much richer Chelsea is not unexpectedbut still a little disappointingHis former clubwho grabbed their place in the Premier League via a 4–3 play-off final victory over Leicester Citywould probably have been a prime candidate for relegation in any eventBut player/manager Hoddle's departure has made it pretty well certainI may be a little naivebut it would have been nice to see a man mentioned as a future England manager demonstrate that he understood the importance of loyaltyI cannot imagine he is terribly short of moneyMoran dropped short of

with Charlton after failing to join the squad for the game in Albania two weeks agois the only change from the team that won that match 2–1 in TiranaIt means another big question mark against the Ireland future of Moranthe 37-year-old Blackburn Rovers defender who has twice made comebacks after announcing his retirement from the international arenaBut Charlton explained the choice of Kernaghan by sayingI've got to think of the futureAlan is just 26 and it's probably purely that which has got him my voteKevin is not written offHe has been playing well and we might well need him againIt has been a very difficult choice for me this timeKernaghanseeking a transfer this summer from relegated MiddlesbroughsaidI'm pleased and relieved because I blamed myself for the goal Albania scored

condition that doctors The expert view is that laughter is medically beneficialIt involved 14 groups of facial muscles and it releases chemicals to the brain that help combat depressionLaughter is an exhilarating exercise whichlike deep breathingmassages the internal organsScientists believe human laughter has an evolutionary origin and is linked with monkeys who grin and display the same shoulder-shaking signsSo how does this wonderful tonic actually workDr David Taylor from the Department of Physiology at Liverpool University explainedPhysicallywhen we laughwe take in a deep breath and let it out again in short sharp burstsWhen we breathe in we contract our pectoral musclesthe muscles in the wall of our chestand our diaphragmWhen we laugh the air outour abdominal muscles do most of the workMost peoplewhen they laughalso exercise more than 14 groups of muscles in their faceA deep belly laugh is good exerciseDr Taylor said the reason why a good laugh makes you feel better is still a mysteryWe know that an hour of mirth is enough to lower our adrenalin levels and also lower the levels of the hormones which the body releases during stressSo laughter is a good antidote to stressSome people have also said that laughter helps the body release chemicals in the brain that are our own internal morphine suppliesSo things really don't feel so bad after a good laughProfessor Hugh FootHead of Psychology at the University of Strathclyde wrote a book on humour and laughter some years ago with Professor Tony Chapman at Leeds UniversityProfessor Foot saidLaughter and the ability to enjoy a sense of fun is taken as a sign of healthy well-beingPeople who have a sense of humour are regarded as being balanced and stable compared to people who are depressed and anxious and have difficulty seeing the funny side of lifeIf you can laugh at yourself and recognise your own folly it is a healthy signWe also use laughter to mask our incompetence and to cover for possible failureMichael Argyle in the department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford has written several books and articles on laughter's close companionhappinessHappinesshe saysis greatly enhanced by close relationships falling in love rates high on the happiness scale as does a satisfying jobBut people without a job who have found fulfilling voluntary work or an absorbing hobby also score highlyAnd what about moneyWell according to Mr Argylemoney plays a small part but does not have as big an effect as people might thinkSo next time you're thinking of reaching for the tablets or slumping miserably into despairtry having a good laugh insteadIt costs nothingthere are no harmful side effects Some of the great smilers Mona LisaBruce ForsythTerry JonesMeg RyanPrincess DianaThe
