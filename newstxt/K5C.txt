Mentally ill open door to visitorsSCOTLAND'S first guest house run by people with mental health problems was opened in Edinburgh yesterday by the Scottish health ministerLord Fraserwrites Alison DanielsThe guest housein Stockbridgeis being organised by the Edinburgh Community Trust on a commercial basisAccording to the trust's Andy Hunterthe aim is not to treat or rehabilitate people but give them an opportunity to workLord Fraser said the project reflected the Government's aim of providing help more suited to individual needsThe Government is determined that as many people as possible with mental health problems live in the communityWith correct supportconfidence and independence can be gained and health and quality of life improvedhe addedPreaching to the despairing with shock tacticsFather James Morrow makes no apology for his uncompromising attitude when he feels it could help to save livesFrank Urquhart meets the controversial pro-life activistFOUR days ago a diminutive figure dressed in black called at the Yorkshire home of Allan and Barbara Blandparents of the Hillsborough disaster victimTony BlandStanding on the step was Father James Morrowthe Roman Catholic priest and pro-life activist who has threatened to bring a private prosecution for murder against the anguished couple if their son is allowed to dieFather Morrow felt it his duty to try to appeal face to face to Tony's parents to allow their son to liveTime and again he has used persuasion and on occasion shock tactics to try to prevent young girls having abortionsHe carries a picture taken by anti-abortionists that depicts the decapitated head of a fully formed foetusrecovered from a rubbish bin behind a clinic in New YorkFather Morrow pointed to the harrowing photograph and saidThe Americans have been very assiduous in getting hold of the garbage after abortionsSinnersprostitutesand thieves can understand in a second the power of that argumentSadly policemagistrates and MPs take a lot longerHe is convinced that abortion is evil and that the historic Lords ruling will open the floodgates to mercy killings and euthanasiaHis campaign has led to him being held in two jailsStrangeways and Pentonvilleand at least Â£2,000 in fines for public order offences which he stubbornly refuses to payIncarceration has been no barrier to his relentless campaignI just show the prisoners a picture of an aborted baby and I say to them if I had done that to a baby I deserve to be herebut what I am trying to do is prevent it happeningHe wanted to tell the Blands that there were people willing to take care of their son for the rest of his lifeif they would allow itThe door of their Leeds homehoweverremained firmly closedFather Morrow spoke yesterday of his visit to the Blands' home after returning to his base at Humanae Vitae Housea former 18th century Catholic chapel in the Deeside village of Braemar which has become the focus of his national campaignHe saidPeople must not attempt to alleviate suffering by murderThere are all sorts of ways in which one can attempt to alleviate suffering but killing your son by any methodwhether starvation or some quicker executionis not among themI wanted to tell Tony Bland's parents that they will prolong their own suffering if they go ahead with thisIt will eventually dawn on them that they have killed their son and they will suffer for that reasonHe addedOnce they have got euthanasia well under way it will be wholesale victory for the anti-God forcesFather Morrow58a native of Paisleyarrived in Braemar in 1980 as a priest at the village's St Andrew's ChurchTen years later he quit as a parish priest to concentrate on his pro-life activitiesHis work with the pro-life movement had begun in 1966 with Sir David Steel's Private Members Bill to legalise abortionsI began campaigning there and thenhe saidAbortion is inherently a total rejection of all that Christianity stands forChristianity says love God above all things and your neighbour as yourselfAbortion says love God if you likelove the neighbour you can seebut there is absolutely no need to love your unborn neighbours you can do them to death with impunityFather Morrow is uncompromising in his stand against abortionThere ishe statesno justification for killing an innocent unborn child under any circumstances whether the mother has been the victim of rape or her own life is threatened by her pregnancyIt is not possible to draw a line between human and human and say some do and some do not have the right to lifehe saidFor almost a decade he has led a series of protest demonstrations outside abortion clinics throughout Englandrunning foul of the law on countless occasionsLast yearhe claimedas many as 70 girls were persuaded not to have abortionsDEREK IRONSIDECampaignerFather James Morrow at the former 18th century Catholic chapel in Braemar which has become the base for his national campaignAs at the last general electionand under the UK system of governmentLabourwith 39 per cent of the votehas 68 per cent of the Scottish parliamentary seatswhereas the SNPwith 21.5 per cent of the votehas 4 per cent of the seatsAs we don't have PR this clearly gives Labour the mandate to put up or shut upto quote Gerry Hassan Points of View9 FebruaryJohn Smithwho has aspirations to be prime minister of the UKhas stated that the Tories have no mandate in Scotland to privatise waterOn the basis of this argumenthoweverwere Labour to win the next election on the numerical strength of MPs returned from Scotlandhe would then have to agree that Labour have no mandate in EnglandIn my viewthe positions of the SNP and Labour are irreconcilable in spite of MP John McAllion's apparent attempt to draw parallelsIn fact the distinctions are obviousbetween Labour's Scottish parliament within the UK and the SNP's vision of a nation state in EuropeSmoked outAn extraordinary new species has been sighted in the centre of Edinburgh recentlyIt appears to favour grouping on city pavements outside office blocks and is most commonly seen around mid-morning or between 12 noon and 2pmIt scuttles out of office doorways with a desperateness that is quickly dispelled by sucking on a whitesmoking cylinderI believe it has been identified as the puffouta distance cousin of our old favouritethe puffinIt has been forced to reveal itself due to strict new regulations for healthier office environments and appears quite harmlessPotholes on the road to democracyWELLHappy AnniversaryIt's now exactly two months since the morning after the march beforeAnd have our esteemed political classes had a meaningful meetingIs the road to Scottish-style democracy and a Scottish parliament just plain littered with members of opposing parties linking arms and striding towards the new tomorrowWellahemnot exactlyBut for all that and all that there have been some interesting stirrings in the undergrowth which may well have the effect of concentrating the minds of the opposition party leadersThis morning for instance the Scottish executive of the people's party will have an opportunity to examine the fruits of some of the labours of the Scottish Trades Union Congresswhich has been functioning as the honest broker following the swiftly evaporating euphoria of the 25,000 souls who turned up on 12 DecemberSome of the thinking which has emerged underlines the impatience of the Scottish electorate with the party spokespeople who claim to have their best interests at heartIt's clear that the many non-party political groups which sprang up in the wake of the electionbodies such as Common Cause and Scotland Unitedare now prepared to work together in a coalition to stage further events highlighting the deficiencies of the current constitutional arrangementsAt the moment they are prepared to work with the political parties in keeping up the momentum December generatedbut it's clear they intend to progress with their agenda whether or not the formal politicians continue to drag their feetIn the immediate term they're determined that there should be no vacuum following publication of the results of the government's stocktaking of the Scottish conditionexpected later this monthTo that end they plan a brief conference on the first Saturday after any pronouncementThe opposition parties will be invited to make individual contributions on that dayand to send a small number of delegatesNeither are the civic groupings planning to hang around much longer waiting for an inter-party meeting to establish common ground and communal tacticsA civic-led summit is also on the spring agendaThere are also all manner of other plans involving not just pan-Scottish events to allow a wider constituency to respond to the implications of the democracy marchbut initiatives which will flag up Scottish concerns across the European parliamentary sceneAt this juncture you may just have noticed a slight differential in pace between the amateursin this democracy gameand the alleged professionalsSpot the ditherers and win a cash prizeThough it would be fair in this instance to absolve the Scottish Liberal Democrats from charges of time-wastingJim Wallace has also been active in trying to put together a political format with which both Labour and the Scottish Nationalist leaders can liveFor behind the public posturingsthere's no doubt that both of these gentlemen have been having more than a little local difficulty with their respective partiesMr Salmond has to appear pure in heart to his diehard fundamentalists by never again having truck with four letter words like devolutionThere is also the small matter of resolving the conundrum of targeting Labour-held seats in an electoral context while standing on common ground over matters such as the taking of stockThe water privatisation saga provides a useful metaphor for the greater debate within Labour and SNP ranksIn theoryboth are as one in opposing water passing from public ownership and controlIn practice they are at daggers drawn as the furore over Tom Clarke's pronouncements on the subject this week amply illustratesYet it is precisely that kind of issue that the coalition would like addressed in a coherent and collaborative fashionTom Clarkemeanwhilehas to persuade a hard core in his own party that acting in concert with the SNP on certain occasions does not equate to dancing with wolvesIn essence that has been his difficulty over responding positively to the clarion cry made in December for a recall of the Scottish parliamentWhatever his views on the subjectLabour's Scottish leader is not in the market for appearing to waltz to any tune called by his Nationalist counterpartBut these issueswhich so often seem to dominate the debate in Scotland at party political levelare frankly of little moment to the electorate at largeMost voters wish a fraction of the energy expended on internecine warfare between fellow opposition parties could be expended in opposing those aspects of Government policy they feel are detrimental to Scotland's futureBut even in the midst of these minefieldsassiduous efforts have been made to fashion a safe passagewayA formula has been devised where instead of any attempts at recalling the Scottish parliamentthe three parties convene their own summit as a parliamentary forum for debate on issues such as future water and sewerage deliveryIf strenuous attempts were also made to involve Scottish business in a real debatethen the mixture of the council and the coalition could be said to reflect a pretty broad national consensusThis wouldin effectfinally sound the death knell for the ConventionBut then it was a creature of its timeand its time and the work it did were about the last electionnot the next oneI suspect that is now the view of the Liberal Democratsso if Labour were to hang on trying to breathe life into the corpse while the Democrats tiptoed from the funeral parlourthen it would lose all legitimacy as a multi-party deviceIf Labour's executive brethren are also disposed to look at new options and new deals today they will doubtless incur some internal wrathIf they don'tthey will find the attention of the electorate turning to fresh pastures anywayTree plantingSteve Rodrick's comments Points of View4 Februarytogether with those of John Palmer todayon recent progress made by the Central Scotland Woodlands Countryside Trust help to shed some light on the difficulties faced by the organisationInstitutional problems are one thingthe problem of interfacing with local communities quite anotherBoth Mr Rodrick and Mr Palmer briefly mention that the local people should have a saypresumably in the planning and implementation of the community forestbut the mechanics of how this will come about are far from clearWith the best will in the world by all involved agenciesenvironmental transformationthrough the planting of trees in the central beltwill only become a realistic objective when the support of landowners and local people is enlistedWhile it would be churlish to pass over the considerable tree planting effort already wrought in the central belt by the trustthe results of a three-year research project undertaken at the University of Edinburgh reveal little evidence that the needs and wants of local people have provided the vehicle for environmental changeAs a resultas far as farmers are concerned tree planting has not been integrated into their work patterns or land managementnor has it led to enhanced levels of interest among previous participantsSignificantlymuch confusion has derived from the apparently different economic and social priorities set by government employeesother plannersconservationists and farmersIf local communities in towns and villages are to be involved in tree planting and managementgoverning institutions need to summon their interest by ensuring that individuals will know how they will benefit from involvementFarmers in the region are deeply committed to their livelihoodsstock and cropsTransfer of such commitment to trees and woodlands would be necessary to ensure the successful promotion of the community forestIt would requirefurthermorethat the current apathy among farmers towards tree planting proposalswhich stems fromamong other thingseconomic constraintslack of confidence in the future of farming and the social hiatus between farmers and their urban neighboursbe addressed at sourceVision is hardly the word that I would have used when considering John Smith's speechreported on your front page 8 FebruaryHelike the rest of ushas seen the effects on this country of 14 years of continuous Tory ruleresulting in the present economic chaos and farceHis only solutionthat he now offersis to adopt those self-same Tory policiesClearly there must be something in the water at Westminster which inevitably drives all our politicians into the realms of

over Â£300,000and secondlyin announcing a Â£300,000 annual grant to the crafts in ScotlandIn case anyone should question these financial allocationscan we point out that they only move the film and

information actThe Right to Know Billwhich I am introducing in the House of Commonswould lift the blanket of official secrecy that so often keeps us in the darkTake safetyAfter many of the recent disasters we later learned that the authorities knew there was a problem all along but the public didn'tIn 1985 more than 50 people died in a fire at Bradford City Football ClubLater it was discovered that the council had written to the club months earlier demanding action to deal with the hazardBut the correspondence was confidentialAfter the Marchioness river boat sank in the Thames in 1989 it was revealed that the ship that crashed into it the Bowbelle had been involved in three previous river accidentsThe accident reports had been kept secretAfter the 1987 fire at Kings Cross underground station which killed 31 peoplethe official inquiry reportedMany of the shortcomingshad in fact been identified before by the internal inquiries into escalator firesThey were also highlighted in reports by the fire brigadepoliceand Railway Fire Prevention and Fire Safety Standards CommitteeNo-one knows whether openness could have prevented these tragediesBut if the public had known about the problemsthey could have demanded improvements and something might have been doneWe should be able to see the files held on us by public authorities to check that they are accurate and fairBut most of them are confidentialWe can see what has been written on our medical records after November 1991 but have no right to the earlier informationNor can we see our social security or employment recordsThe Government refuses to publish reports showing whether the tobacco industry is keeping to the voluntary agreements that restrict tobacco advertising near schoolsWe cannot see the official tests showing which cars cause least pollution or have the best safety featuresMinisters refuse to publish the list of environmentally sensitive areas which RAF pilots are told to avoid during low flying exercisesThe penalties handed down by police disciplinary hearings are secretThe Iraqgate affair demonstrates how secrecy lets Government get away with dangerous dishonestyMinisters relaxed the guidelines on the exports of arms equipment to Iraqbut kept the new policy secretto avoid criticismThree businessmen were then prosecuted for selling Iraq machine tools for making weapons but confidential documents showed that they had told ministers what they were doing and had been encouraged to carry onOne of them was actually working for the intelligence servicesYet the prosecution went ahead and ministers tried to suppress these documentsUnbelievablythe court was told that they would not help the defence case a demonstrable falsehood that could have landed the three in jailNot just the quality of public debatebut even our libertymay depend on the right to knowBritain is one of the few democracies that still doesn't have a freedom of information actAmericanAustraliaCanadaNew ZealandFranceDenmarkHollandNorway and Greece all have them Sweden has had one for more than 200 yearsOften we can learn more about Britain under the American information law than we can from WhitehallThe Right to Know Bill would open up the files of government and official bodiesOf course some information should be secretThe bill protects details of people's private livesand information which could harm defencelaw enforcement or genuine commercial secretsIt also amends the Official Secrets Act to allow someone who had been prosecuted to argue that releasing information was in the public interestIt would give people the right to see their employment recordsAnd it would force companies to say in their annual reports whether they had broken laws on consumer protectionsafetythe environment and discriminationThe bill has the backing of MPs of all parties but it is vital that they actually support it in the Commons on 19 FebruaryIf you care about your right to knowask your MP to vote for itTom jumps in at the deep endTHE Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland has two demanding and very often unrewarding jobsAs effective leader of the Scottish Labour Partyhe has to weld that frequently fissiparous organisation togetherto set his stamp on its policies for Scotlandand to campaign against the Governmentadopting a high profile for himself and the oppositionAs shadow secretaryhe has a duty in the House of Commons to cross-question his opposite number and to turn a relentless searchlight on his public pronouncementsIn both of these roles he is himself exposed to close scrutiny at the hands of other politicians and the mediaas if this was not enoughTom Clarkenewly returned to politics after illnesshas another difficultywhich is to represent a party in the process of remodelling itselfHis leaderJohn Smithhas announced a conversion from the traditional Labour policy towards state control of industry to one in which the question of ownership is largely irrelevantIt was notthereforesurprising to find Mr Clarke somewhat exposed when facing some pressing questions on BBC Scotland about Labour's plans for returning water to public hands at some point in the futureInstead of gently deflecting the pointhe conceded that removing private companies might be hard to doAhasaid Mr Clarke's critics and there are a few arounda clear betrayal of Labour's commitmentan act of treacheryan exposure of Labour's essential hypocrisyetcThat was all fairly predictableand unlikely to prove of lasting damageMr Clarke is notafter allthe firstnor will he be the last politician to find himself caught on the hop by a shrewd interviewerHoweverthe shadow secretary's remarks to the Scottish Trade Unions for Labour in Glasgow last Friday may take a little more explainingThis after all was a prepared speechIn it he said that the Scottish financial sector did nothing to help the country's economythat it benefited only a selected minorityand that it put little back into ScotlandThis is a fairly staggering claimnot least for the 200,000 odd people employed by an industry which has expanded to the point where Scotland is currently the second biggest financial centre in the ECEven ignoring its importance as a local employerto say that a sector which earns 15 per cent of GDPwhich finances most of the small business start-ups in Scotlandwhich provides capital for companies great and smallwhich finances pensions and insurance for thousands of Scotsas well as backing for a quarter of the UK's institutional fundsdoes nothing to help the economyis to carry ideology to the point of follyMore than thishoweverit devalues Edinburgh's reputation for probity in financial dealings which is a vital counterbalance to some of the excesses of the City of LondonAnother statement of clarificationmay well be in order from Mr Clarke and his advisersShadow boxingTHE apparent squabble between the South African government and the ANC over the precise nature of their agreement on the immediate political future is more show than anything elseHaving reached a consensus on the shape of the interim administrationwhich is to steer the country to full democracyand what that democracy should look likethey have come under pressure from the others involved in the stalled multi-party discussions about South Africa's futureNow President de Klerk and the ANC leadership are trying to tone down the outcome of the talks in order not to appear to have pre-empted a decision before the others have had a chance to have their sayIf one looks behind what is being said by both sidesthere is in fact little that divides themIt is more a question of terminology than anything elseWhile the government negotiator Fanus Schoeman insists that the ANC has agreed to share power because a government of national unity is power-sharingthe ANC leader Nelson Mandela said on Saturday that an interim government of national unity was not power-sharing and that the body would include all parties who have won a certain proportion of seats in a constituent assemblyBut that is what Shoeman indicated as wellIndeeda similar interpretation was put forward by President de Klerk yesterday when he said that there had been no firm agreement on power-sharing and stressed the need for the resumption of multi-party talksWith convergence also on the issue of regional autonomyit is hard to see what all the fuss and bother is aboutHoweverwith an eye to the other organisationsthe sound of pedals being rotated backwards has been deafeningAlready de Klerk has emphasised that Inkatha participation in any negotiations is fundamental to the processfollowing dire threats of political violence not to be discounted from its leaderChief ButheleziAt the same time Mandela's remarks indicate that hetoorecognises the need to involve all the parties in the democracy negotiations if they really are to be democraticRealisticallyit has to be recognised that without some sort of consensus between the two largest playersthe government and the ANCabout key pointsthe talks would have been doomed anywayHaving clearly sorted out most of their substantial differencesthese two must now return to the multi-party negotiations and ensure that all voices are heard and taken into accountSchool saviour finishes bottom of the clashSchooling in New York was in turmoil so Joseph Fernandez was appointed as a troubleshooter but strife was rife and he was sackedMichael Pye reportsJOSEPH Fernandez just sat therehis face sometimes reddeningall dayHe is New York's schools chancellorhead of the public schools systemand he found himself last week on public trialA man called him the devilsome parents shouted We Want Joeand the talk was all about condomsAIDS and innocenceWhen the evidence was inthe seven members of the board of education did what everyone knew they wouldThey fired the man whotwo years beforewas reckoned the finest educator in the United StatesThat was when Fernandez was hired from Miami for $195,000 a year and a basket of pension plans that would excite a baseball playerHe was going to save New York's schoolsNow nobody is quite sure they can be savednot while such a huge organisation answers to this board of educationAnd with the top schools job vacant in New YorkLos AngelesChicago and Bostonthe fearful thought is thiscan anyone at all save the schools of America's citiesThe story is much the same in all four citiessocial conservatives trying to push their ideas through school boardsparents frustrated that schools have fancy ideas but don't seem to teach children to figurewrite or readThe combination is explosiveAnd Joseph Fernandez's old job has other complicationsbeing second-guessed continuously by an unelected board of education that puts its small moral agenda above all elsesabotaged by the remains of corrupt school boardsstarved of federal money and unable to settle on a contract with the teachers' unionThe job was thisFernandez was hired to end 20 years of chaos caused by decentralising New York's huge school systemThe notion was that communities should have a say in what was taughtand the hidden agenda was to end the undeclared war between predominantly white and Jewish teachersand an increasingly black and Hispanic body of pupilsThe consequence was that good old New York traditioncronyismcorruption and graftAds on the subways asked us to call a confidential hotline if we knew what crimes our local school board was committingAt the time half the city's school boards were distracted by criminal investigations into how a grand piano went home with a board memberhow their election hand-outs came to be printed by school members on school presseswhy others dealt drugs and what exactly was the price of a promotion $10,000 could get you a deputy principalship in the BronxSchool board superintendents complained they had to hire the buddiesallies and nephews of board membersOthers complained about the superintendentsAnnie Wolinskywho superintended Board 9 in the Bronxleft behind $13,000 worth of postage stamps hidden in a drawera warehouse stuffed with unreported supplieseight staff members whose only job was to videotape board members on requestand a phone bill into the thousands of dollars which consisted mostly of calls to the various city porn linesShe also failed to notice the board had hired a teacher with convictions for exposing himself to schoolgirlsor ask why a probationary principal was still in place despite pleading guilty to a $21,000 welfare scamAt least she was spared the ignominy of the board in Washington Heightsin upper Manhattanwhere a teacher was arrested in his schoolyard carrying cocainemarijuanavalium and a switch-bladeFernandez seemed the answer to thisHe was a New Yorkerfor a startand a Puerto RicanWhat he didn't sayuntil he published his autobiography last yearwas that he was also a high school drop-out who'd been a heroin addicta splendid example of rising out of the rot of the inner cityHe took office on 2 January 1990 and within three weeks he'd demanded the right to approve the boards' choices for school superintendentsa notion which later fell foul of the courtsBy Marchhe'd won the right to remove incompetent principals like the one in the Bronx who had been convicted of possessing crack cocaineIn October he felt strong enoughbuoyed by public supportto tackle the mayor on the matter of budget cuts whichhe claimedwould cripple the school systemEven his supporters began to notice something curiousInstead of lobbying at City Hallhe liked to turn up early to civic events and leaveostentatiouslyjust before the mayor arrivedIt wasn't politicalIt wasn't tactfulIt turned out to be all too typicalThe point was to chatnudgepersuadeHe refused to listen to Norman Adlerthe political consultant hired by a local foundationHe simply puts on his army boots and marches aheadAdler saysregretfullyAll this matters in a system with overlapping powerswith a tendency to divide Manhattan and its liberal politicians and the mayor from the concerns of the outer boroughsIronicallyFernandez was a brilliant lobbyist in Washington for more federal funds for New York schoolsand he'll be sorely missedbut he couldn't find the time to play the politics of his own backyardWorsehe didn't call in on schoolsWhole sectors of the city never saw himHe did give power to schools and parentsbut that made him enemiesHe did try to give parents the right to choose a school for their children and not just accept the one that happened to be closestthis matteredsince property values soar where schools are goodHe announced a significant improvement in city-wide maths scores in 1991a decline in the drop-out rate from 20.8% to 17.2% which at least made a bad situation less appallingBut he missed something obviousFor yearssocial conservatives who may be fundamentalistspart of Pat Robertson's Christian Coalitiongood Catholics have seen school boards as a political powerbasesomewhere to challenge liberal orthodoxy on matters like queersevolution and birth controlThe board of education is appointed five members by the five

aren't safeA friend who teaches both in Brooklyn and at the jails on Rijkers Island says she feels far less secure in schoolThe journey to school can be a matter of daily terror in some areasAnd these schools don't work too wellReading scores are lowmaths scores are low and the amount of repair work needed when kids get to collegeif they dois phenomenalA drop-out rate of 17.2% is nothing to brag aboutalthough Fernandez didAdd all this together and you have a formidable coalition of parents blackHispanicAsian as well as the mainly Catholic groups like the Italians and the Irish who want schools to be orderlytheir children to be safethe teaching to be orthodox and to concentrate on readingwriting and arithmeticOn 14 December 1990 Fernandez proposed to distribute condoms in schools without parental consentHe argued that the spread of AIDS among teenagers was too obvious and too wide for inactionOn 26 November1991New York became the first American city to hand out condomsWe'll never know how many lives were savedhow many teenage pregnancies were avoidedhow much sexually transmitted disease wasn't transmitted as a resultBut we do know what enemies Chancellor Fernandez madeFernandez was in troublebut he didn't see it that wayHe went on to propose a Rainbow Curriculum without actually reading it first which tried to teach tolerance for allbut in the process had to discuss homosexuality with kids of eightThe ceiling fellOne Queens school board refused to teach the curriculumGay activists and ladies with steel hair shouted each other downOn Thanksgiving last yearthe borough president of QueensClare Shulmancalled Fernandez to suggest an academic panel rework the Rainbow Curriculumjust to cool the issueDays laterFernandez suspended the Queens school board that refused his curriculumand ten days after that the board of education reinstated them allFernandez back-pedalled on the Rainbow Curriculumand waited for New York State to confirm that teachers couldn't be forced into spending half their time for sex education on counselling abstinenceBut it wasn't enoughEveryone everyone who matters in Manhattanthat is says the system will have to changeMaybe each borough should run its own schoolsmaybe the mayor should have greater powersmaybe school districts could be small and autonomousSomeone's got to wipe out the graft and

companies that can develop and licence pharmaceutical productsThe problems of sifting out the valuable and proven ingredients of native medicines are formidableThe practitioners frequently have no form of writing and their multitude of languages present great problems for translatorsThe people are generally friendly but shy and it takes a long time to gain their confidence to the point where they will teach a visiting scientist the secrets of their artFor people like my daughter there is also the ethical dilemma to be faced on the funding needed to support the research workFinding a potential wonder drug in the root of some Amazonian plant might easily excite the giant pharmaceutical industry players but there is then the risk that over exploitation would change the way of life of the natives and potentially destroy the very environment one is trying to preserveFor example quinineextracted from the bark of the cinchona treewas used by the South American Indians to reduce malarial fever long before the Spanish invaded in 1500Cinchona used to grow in profusion on the eastern slopes of the Andes but over-cropping caused the trees to die out by the mid 1800sSynthetic drugs such as quinacrine and chloroquinewere developed to replace natural quinine but some strains of malaria are found to be resistant and doctors are using quinine again to treat malaria in Vietnamfortunatelytrees grow well in Java which is now the main global sourceObviously not all shaman practices are applicable in the modern worldone procedure involved blowing tobacco smoke over a sick person because it was believed to have magical healing powers I can't see that selling too well todayScotland has a well established relationship with the pioneering work in the Colombian Amazon and Dr Sandy Grayof Strathclyde Universitymakes frequent visits thereThe Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh also has had a long involvement with the cultivation and development of plants with medicinal properties and we have our own Scottish traditions of herbal cures for a long list of ailmentsGiven that there does not seem to be the same reluctance to imbibe proteins made from plants as there is to be using the proteins in the milk of Dr Ron James' transgenic sheep or Scotgen's humanisedmouse antibodiesthere may be a good case for a local entrepreneur to transfer an Amazonian shaman's technology to make a Scottish national wonder drugFinancing such an enterprise should be possible since James's Pharmaceutical Proteins and Scotgen both raised several million dollars of venture capital admittedly from American and French sourcesHome-grownEdinburgh's Royal Botanic Garden also has had a long involvement with the development of plants with medicinal propertiesNo business with words of lurveVALENTINE'S Day reached a new low in bad taste this year when the Diary received a truly awful business Valentine card with a twelve-line poem that was excruciatingly awfulEven if the consultants William Mercer Fraser are as good at business as they claim to be and the answer to everyone's communications problemsthe style is a guaranteed turn-offUse of donors' blood supplies in private hospitalsRecentlyin these columns I repeated the claim that commercial hospitals are being subsidised by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Servicea division of the NHSProfessor Ronald H Girdwoodthe chairman of the Scottish Blood Transfusion Associationtook me to task in a letter at the end of last monthHe is a renowned and honourable manbut with regard to this matter he is either being naive or obtuseHere are the factsFor the first 40 years of its existencethe blood transfusion authority in Scotland provided the private sector with blood on request and without making any charge whatsoeverIt had no idea if the private hospitals were in turn charging their patientsThis subsidising of profit-making medical establishments was not mentioned in SNBTS annual reportsParliament was not aware of the practicevoluntary donors were never informedThen in the early 1980sas a result of a campaign by local health councils and trade unionsthe Government introduced a minimal less than Â£20 per unithandling chargeAt the time Professor Girdwood's association the prime aim of this charitablevoluntary body is to promote the interests of donors and pass their worries to Governmentrefused to take any part in this move for overdue reformIn the last decadethe handling charge has been raised slightlyThe contention of many is that the charge should be at three or four times the present levelThis would end the gifting by the NHS to the private sector in Scotland of not less than Â£200,000 each year over Â£2 million south of the BorderMeanwhileit would be fairer and franker of the SNBTS to mention in its information leaflets and at its collection centres that a donor's blood might end up in the private sectorAt the same time a check should be made to ensure that the private sector passes on only the handling charge to its patientsLastlyit should not be beyond the capacity of the SNBTS undoubtedly the most efficient in Britain andthereforequite possibly the worldto devise a system whereby those who wish their blood to stay with the NHS can be satisfiedFilling the vacuumCRIME is no longer something that happens to other peopleThe chilling pictures of tiny James Bulger being led away to a brutal death have touched millionsnot just because of the tragedy that befell a little boy but because they have made people realise how much their own lives have become defiled by fear of crimeParents deny their children the outdoor play that they themselves enjoyedHouseholders return home apprehensive of having been burgledPeople stay in at night to avoid the shadows of the city streetsCar-owners disable their vehicles every time they parkA mother takes her eye off her toddler in a shopping mall and he is murderedWe are all victimsWe all want something doneBut the trouble is that peopleunable to understand why it is happeningtend to look backwardsnot around themfor answersThey presume that changing values are declining values and seek some malign influence to blameTake yesterday's comments by two former Home SecretariesKenneth Baker and Lord Merlyn-Reesabout the Bulger caseMany would endorse Mr Baker's diagnosis of the moral vacuumsurrounding some young peopleBut what is his prescriptionNew forms of detentionfewer trendy clerics andfamiliarlyless violent televisionLord Merlyn-Reestoobelieves that violence on television incites violence in the youngBoth stop short of demanding censorshipthough Mary Whitehouse is characteristically less tentativeThe problem with this sort of approach is that it can make standards yet more remote from those most in need of themDissuade churches from social commentand all that is left is abstract philosophyTake all violence out of television drama and you disconnect it from realityleaving it unable to portray anything deeper than its own bondsSome performance art does contain gratuitous violenceBut it is not generally the stuff that appears on televisionwhere self-restraint has become the normIt is the stuff in the video shopto which people have consciously turned in preference to what is broadcastThatsadlyis a market at workand suppressing it would only bestow the seedy glamour of the undergroundEven ifas is open to questionscreen violence really does invite emulationthat is the wrong approachThe challenge is to attract the alienated young back into the heart of societynot reduce its appeal for them still furtherThere can never be an excuse for what happened to James Bulgerbut we should all hope that some day there will be a better understanding of why it happenedRecession cureMost economistsindustrialists and politicians seem to agree that the cure of recession and unemployment must depend on reducing interest rates to boost economic growthpersonal consumption and industrial investmentThat recipe may have been appropriate in the past when personal consumption was largely met from the output of labour-intensive British industriesBut nowadays much of any increased consumption will be met by extra imports from countries with more efficient industries or cheaper labourand by extra output from British industries generated by greater automation and productivity per employee rather than by increased employmentAnd extra investment in industry will be directed to still further improving that productivity and minimising the need for manpowerThe main penalty of recession is unemploymentand what we need is more jobsnot more consumptionWe already have too much consumptionparticularly of things damaging to health and the environmentof sugarconfectioneryfatty foodsalcoholtobaccomotoringnoisy entertainmentpornographyprostitutionand the toys and knick-knacks produced by polluting industriesRather than a boost to consumptionwe need some redistribution of wealth from the employed to the creation of jobs for the unemployedWe should increase taxes on inessentialunhealthy and damaging forms of consumption and use the proceeds to fund socially beneficial forms of employmentThere should be a heavy excise duty on sugarhigher taxation of motor fueland an extension of VAT to all but the necessities for healthy lifeprincipally unsweetened cereal products and raw fruitvegetablesfishmeateggs and pasteurised milkThe proceeds should fund the creation of extra jobs in the construction of crimefire and rot-resistant housingthe improvement of public transporta strengthening of the law enforcement agenciessupervision of school areas against bullyingremoval of litter and graffiti from public placesand labouring in schemes of environmental improvementPresent policies seem likely to yield too few extra jobs for the price that will ultimately have to be paid in renewed inflation or higher taxation of earnings and savingsTreaty protocolIn a diary item 12 FebruaryFordyce Maxwell accuses me of having trouble with the factsEven a cursory examination of amendment 27 to the Maastricht Bill will show that it is not me but Mr Maxwell who is having troubleFor the recordI stated on Radio Scotlandthat amendment 27 if carried would not be a vote for the Social ChapterI went on to say it would be the exact oppositeAmendment 27 seeks to delete the protocol on social policy from the Maastricht TreatyThe social protocolif implementedwould simply give the UK's permission to the other 11 community states to use community institutions and funds to meet the cost of administering their separate social agreementConsequentlyto delete the protocol would prevent this happeningSo a vote for amendment 27 will be a vote to prevent the social chapter being administeredWhich is whyI will have no difficulty in supporting amendment 27The message in Clinton's rhetoricWHEN President Clinton unveils his plans for the US economy in full todayAmericans will already have a fairly clear idea of what faces themOn Monday evening he gave fair warning of an increase in taxesand spending cuts to reduce the expanding federal budget deficitBoth were necessaryhe saidin order to build the foundation for an improvement in the standard of livingShort-term pain for long-term gain or in his wordsthis is nothing less than a call to armsto restore the vitality of the American dreamIt is a bold movesince it throws into reverse one of Clinton's central election pledgesDuring his campaignhe promised not to raise taxes for the middle classeshe is now faced with the realisation that if he is to cut the deficit and fulfil his promises to improve social welfareeducation and training and to overhaul health provisionsthen tax increases which extend beyond the seriously wealthy are unavoidableBy appealing directly to his fellow-citizens and banking on a generous responsethe President may just have gambled correctlyIt was certainly a more honest confession than George Bush ever managedand by saying that he has been forced into this decision by an expanding deficit which has gone beyond even the worst official government estimates from last yearhe is also confronting Americans with some central truths about their economic situationBy rightsWall Street should have responded wellHereafter allwas a President prepared to take the economy seriously and to begin the long process of hauling it back into some semblance of orderInsteadthe dealers took the short-term viewjudged that Clinton's credibility would sufferand began sellingWhether the steep falls of yesterday turn into something more serious remains to be seenBut as the speculators wait for the President's more substantive statementthey might reflect that the average middle class voter will probably see things rather differentlyThisafter allis a programme designed to cut the US budget deficit and boost the economyIt is moving in the right directionThere are those who argue that the signs of a recovery obviate any additional action by the administration to boost the economyIndeedthat hands-off approach underlay the whole trickle downphilosophy of the Reagan and Bush yearsBut given the current high levels of unemployment Clinton must be right to take positive actionAs well as the pain of tax increasesthe president is also proposing a stimulus of $16 billion in spending on public works projects and $15 billion in tax breaks for businesses as an immediate step to get the economy moving and combat unemploymentThis will be followed by longer term stepsThese are sensible measuresand Clinton deserves better from the Wall Street panic-merchantsHe is likely to find a more solid and reliable reaction from the public opinion polls later this weekThey will tell him what middle America thinks of a President who is prepared to face realityRight's desperate search for a new RenaissanceTHE National Front published its 300 measures for a Renaissance of Franceon MondayA year ago it would have made headline newsTodaywith just over a month to go before the general electionit only merited a few lines on the inside pagesFor the past decade the almost continuous and often spectacular rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme-right party has been the great talking point of French politicsNow it appears to have gone off the boilIts propositions are no less outrageousits leaders' language no less extremeBut the novelty has begun to wear thinand the nation is turning its attention to other mattersEven the normally ebullient Mr Le Pen has had to lower his sightsBefore the regional elections a year ago he was constantly predicting that his party would win 15-20 per cent of the voteNowin the run up to the general electionhe is talking more modestly of its showing a progression in votesIn factit will be lucky to do even thatThe latest opinion polls are predicting that the National Front will get between 10 and 12 per cent of the vote down both from the 14 per cent it won in last year's regional elections and from Mr Le Pen's own record score of 14.4 per cent in the 1988 presidential electionsThe immigration issuethe National Front's favourite political battering ramis still thereSome 100,000 immigrants continue to pour perfectly legally into the country every yearNine million 16 per centof France's 57 million inhabitants are now first or second generation immigrantsBut the continuing slowdown in the economycoupled with a rise in unemployment to an all-time record of just on 3 million 10.5 per cent of the workforcehas pushed these concerns into second placeAnd the French public no longer accepts the National Front's simplistic equation of immigration with unemploymentIn a pollpublished last weekasking voters to rank in order of priority the issues they most wanted discussed during the election campaignunemployment came top by a long wayfollowed by worries about the funding of the badly-indebted State pension and social security fundand then education and trainingImmigration was mentioned only in fourth placefollowed by urban crimeand then the environmentThe National Front has been suffering from two other developments on the French political sceneOn the one handthe two mainstream right-wing partiesthe neo-Gaullist RPR and the centre-right UBFhave succeeded in stealing some of its thunder by themselves espousing more extremist positions on immigration and by adopting a more overtly nationalist and populist tone on other issues like MaastrichtAt the same timethe rise of the Greens has robbed the National Front of its role as the main anti-establishmentprotest partyTwenty three of the 300 measuresin the National Front's new programme are devoted to environmental mattersBut the Greens are still a good 5-8 points ahead of the Front in the opinion pollsJust over a year ago everyone got a bit of a scare when an opinion poll showed that one third of the French agreed with the extremist ideas supported by Mr Le Pen priority for the French as opposed to immigrantsin jobshousingand family benefitsthe abolition of all income tax and its replacement with higher rates of VATthe reintroduction of the death penalty for murderers and drug traffickersand the expulsion of the immigrant long-term unemployedthe banning of tourist visas for Arabs and Africans to stop illegal immigrationand so onBut most publicity was given to the finding in the same poll that two-thirds of the French regarded Mr Le Pen as a positive danger for democracywhile three quarters believed his party was incapable of governing FranceThe latest polls showed that 82 per cent have a poor opinion of the National Front the highest rejection rate for any partyNeverthelessMr Le Pen should not be under-estimatedHe remains a formidable political operator and is usually at his best on the hustingsAlthough support for his party seems to be stagnating and may even be on the declineit still has an important followingmainly among the poorer working and artisan classes and the retiredThe election campaign has only just got under wayand Mr Le Pen may yet reclaim the limelightBut there is not much he can really hope for in the present electionsUnder the system of proportional representation used in the 1986 electionhis party managed to win 35 parliamentary seats with just under 10 per cent of the voteBut with the return of the two-round majority voting systemit is unlikely to win more than one or two seats this timeeven if it succeeds in equalling its previous best score of 14 per centIn the past the National Front has sometimes managed to enter into local pacts with the two mainstream right-wing partiesBut nowbuoyed by the prospect of a landslide victory in Marchthey no longer want to have anything to do with the disreputable Mr Le PenIn futurethe danger of extreme-right policies is more likely to come from within the victorious mainstream conservative ranks than from outsideWhen judges lean too far towards leniencyProf Ross Harper supports legislation to give the Crown the right of appeal against sentence in ScotlandSENTENCING is one of the most important functions of a judgeThe word judgefor the purpose of this articleincludes sheriffs and magistratesThey pass judgment on an accused taking into account the gravity of the crime and the circumstances of the accusedSentences vary from an absolute discharge to life imprisonmentand include deferred sentenceadmonitionprobationfines and community serviceIn Scotlandwe do not have the English system of suspended sentencesIn Englandthe Crown may apply to review a sentence as they are contemplating in the recent case of rape where the accused was told to give Â£5OO to the victim for a holidayAt present in Scotland there is no right of the Crown to appeal against too lenient a sentenceThere ishowevera bill currently going through Parliament which will change that situationMost often our judges are totally rightUnhappilyin some cases they are hopelessly wrongSometimesjudges have bad daysWe all doSometimesa judge will be particularly impressed by a mellifluous and seductive plea put up on behalf of an accused and will sentence leniently to the point of mistakeSometimesa judge may suffer from irrational horror at a particular case and sentence too severely to the point of mistakeMistakes can be madeand if we do not allow correction we are fooling ourselvesIf a judge has slept badlyhas had an indigestible breakfasttripped over the cathas been roundly abused by his wife and scolded by his childrenor if his mind has been distracted by the children's school reportsa narrow defeat at a curling match or whateverhe may be temporarily off formWhere probation is appropriate a prison sentence may mistakenly be imposed or vice versaIf the judge makes a mistake by imposing too severe a sentencethen the accused canand often doesappeal to a higher courtIf the High Court agrees that the sentence is too severethen that sentence may be amendedThis is properthis is just andas importantlyit is the lawBut if a judge errs the other way and fines a rapist a few hundred poundsor puts on probation a bank robber with previous convictions who clearly ought to go directly to jailnothing happensSimply because the Crown does not have a right of appeal against sentenceThat is what the Government is changingIn my viewrightly soMany argue that such an appeal by the Crown against too lenient a sentence is simply not cricketIf an accused person hears that he is going to be sentenced to one year in jailit is argued that it would be distinctly unfair for a prosecutor to appealPersonallyI am not in favour of mammoth jail sentences except for the deserving few and that's not so much a matter of punishment as a means of keeping society free from their future depredationsBut society has an interest in the determination of the caseI readily acknowledge that in Scotland the Crown has no direct interest in sentence in as much as it doesn'tin contrast with Russia or Americarequest the court to impose a specific sentenceThe prosecutor presents the facts fairly and cogently to the judge whoafter hearing the defence submissionsreaches a conclusion as to sentenceWhether the Crown should have an interest in sentence or not isof courseanother matterI am personally seduced by the prospect of the Crown and the defence being able to agree a sentence prior to a pleaespecially in the case of large complex fraud trialsBut that's another major debateBut why on earth should the Crown not be allowed to appealIf we accept that mistakes in sentencing can be made and accept that sentencing is a matter of considerable interestimportance and relevance to societyand accept that the prosecution represents societythen it is simply monstrous that an appeal does not lie at its handsIn many criminal cases there are victims casualties of assaultrapetheft or fraudSentencing process encapsulates the interest of allThe victim does not have a special place in the criminal courtThe victim is not representednor indeed necessarily consultedThe victim has no right of representationSince sentencing is a matter of societal process and since we engage in an adversarial systema right of appeal which is given to one side should not be denied to the otherBy doing soI readily acknowledge that we are changingever so slightlythe role of the Crown with regard to sentencingI personally welcome that changeSentencing is too important to be left in the hands of one person without recourse to a higher authorityWhile supporting change to allow the Crown the right of appeal against too lenient sentencesI would advocate another changeI abhor sentences being increased sneakilyAnd this can happenWhen I was very youngand indeed Malcolm Rifkindwho was even youngerwas my counselwe represented two individuals who were charged with a serious assaultThey were both old lags and were sentenced each to ten years imprisonmentWe thought this was an exceptionally high sentence and both of them appealedOne of the accused withdrew his appealthe other proceeded with itHis sentence was increased to one of 12 yearsThisin my viewis totally wrong and contrary to my notions of natural justiceBy all means let either side appealbut you cannotin all conscienceincrease the sentence of some poor beggar who aversoften acting with appropriate legal advicethat the sentence is already too highFair's fairTaking note of sex and the single studentAs university teachers suggest a code of conductDea Birkett recalls a personal encounter with a lecherous lecturerAS EVERY student knowsaffairs with lecturers are as much a part of university life as examination nervesdrunken parties and late night deliberations on the Romantic poetsBut as long as these extra-curricular affairs are conducted discreetly behind closed departmental doorsthe academic establishment turns a blind eyeAt last the Association of University Teachers AUThas brought the subject of staff-student sexual relations out into the openIn a draft policy statement entitledUniversity Consensual Relationshipspublished last weekthe AUT recommends lecturers officially report romantic or sexual involvement and cease professional responsibility for the student concernedThe AUT statement is designed to protect students from sexual harassment and lecturers from charges of favouritismAs the statement makes clearStudents who are involved in sexual/romantic relationships with staff and who do not consider their involvement to be truly consensual should have the right of complaint under a sexual harassment policyBut in the hierarchical world of academiadrawing a line between consensual and non-consensual sex is far from easyAs the AUT statement recognisesto embark upon a sexual/romantic relationship with a student involves serious difficulties rooted in the unequal powerand hence choiceof the parties concernedMy own experiences echo these difficultiesWhen I was a 22-year-old Edinburgh University studenta tutor made unwelcome sexual advances to me in his officeFrom my perspectiveit was a clear cut case of abuseBut at the same time as my accusation was being assessed by a prestigious board of Edinburgh academicsjust a departmental door away a female student and her male lecturer were engaging in clandestine consensual sexThere was nothing forced or unwanted in their relationshipthey fancied each othermentally and physicallyand as two reasonable adults indulged their desiresShe felt no grounds for grievanceand many years later still has no regretsNow a lecturer herselfher former lover is a good and supportive friendNot all academic alliances are as equalI remember one dashing lecturer who regularly took his pick from each year's fresher intakeAll of his young women would have regarded their conduct as consensualThe lecturer may have been 20 years olderwealthierand inevitably wiserbut that is often why the student chose to sleep with himPowereven academic poweris very sexyThe AUT's draft policy statement points to this imbalanceBut is it the role of trade unions to monitor how equal personal relationships areShould an office worker's union draw up guidelines requiring bosses to declare publicly if they see their secretaries after hoursPerhaps the relationship between academic staff and student is essentially different so that regulation is requiredIt is only the medical profession that legislates for sex between doctors and patientsThe General Medical Council advises that if a medical practitioner engages in a sexual relationship with his patient this may be considered an abuse of privilege and lead to charges of serious professional misconductThe AUT's discussion paper points to many qualities trustconfidence and dependency shared by academics and doctorsIn additionit argues that in the academic arenaa single affair can affect more than two peopleFellow students and colleagues and the learning and working environment will be affectedespecially when conflict of interest and unfairness are involvedIn the United Statessome colleges implement policies which bar staff from engaging in any sexual conduct with a studenthowever consensualThe AUT has rejected recommending such strict policing of personal relationshipA motion supporting a code of conduct preventing consensual relationships as constituting an abuse of powerwas dropped in favour of a more softly-softly approachThe member of staff must reportbut need not terminatethe relationshipThe AUT's code is an implicit recognition of the right of university students to bed down with the partner of their choiceWomen should not simply be seen as smitten fools in need of protectionwhen they accept the advances of those professionally above themthey know the murky pond in which they plungeYet still many choose for reasons good or bad but their own to sleep with their academic teachersWe cannot separate power from sexBut we can distinguish between wanted and unwanted sexual attentionespecially important in universities where futures are forgedStaff-student sexual relationships are not role modelsbut nor are they necessarily deplorablesexual harassment of a student isMy own case dragged on for monthsswamped with innuendos if another student was having a clandestine consensual affairwhy couldn't I have been tooEventually my case was supported and the tutor asked to resignBy opening those departmental doorsthe AUT guidelines provide a powerful weapon against the hidden crime of sexual harassment in the ivory towersGetting smart on skivingPaola Buonadonna and Douglas Fraser look at the measures being taken to combat truancy in schools and collegesWe have actually saved money because the system saves the work of a teacher and a halfWe are able to identify absentees and use the extra time to tackle the problemSCHOOL pupils skipping classes to play with the latest piece of Sonic the Hedgehog software could find another computer is at work to track them downTheir absence may be noted by devices like optical mark readersand swipe cardswhich log them in and out of each lessonStudentstooare already finding further education colleges are tracking them electronicallywith interest likely to grow as universities become aware of poor attendance at lecturesThe use of information technology to keep tabs on truants is receiving particular encouragement south of the Borderwhere the Department for Education is putting Â£8.6 million into stepping up the fight against truancywhile Scottish Office research has put emphasis on identifying the varied causesThree main programmes have been tried and tested so far in schools and colleges on both sides of the BorderSmart cards are perhaps the best known of the devices in the fight against school-dodging and they also contribute to security and safetyThe electronic identity cards are swiped through readers stationed in every classroom at the beginning of each lessonThe systemdeveloped by the Dundee-based company Offcome Datacosts around Â£10,000 to installincluding the computersthe readers and the cardsIts advantages include the virtual elimination of the time-consuming registering routine and its versatilityIt can be used to gain access to libraries or computer rooms in the buildingsAnd in the event of fireit offers immediate and reliable information on the number and location of people to be evacuatedSatisfied customers include Perth College of Further Education which installed the system five years agoJack Gardnerdirector of the management and information system unit at the collegesaysWe needed a faster and more accurate registration method and this works exceptionally wellOur main concern was not truancybut our students still need to show high attendance to guarantee their feesThe system invested them with this responsibility and there is no room for errors or excusesWe paid for it ourselvesbut covered expenses by cutting soul-destroying administrative jobs which only involved keying in namesThe system has its drawbacks as a response to school truancyIt would be quite easy for a pupil to swipe in several cards allowing his friends to truantBut its time-saving qualities up to 30 minutes each day for each teacher attracted the St George's School for Boys in Southamptonwhich has been piloting the system for two yearsDEPUTY head teacher Brian Musk saysWe have actually saved money because the system saves the work of a teacher and a halfWe are able to identify absentees immediately and use the extra time to tackle the problem with academic counsellingOur pupils are conscious of being awarded responsibility and there has been no abuse of the cards at allThe Optical Mark Readerproduced by Johnson and Pinnockat Â£5,000 to Â£6,000is a cheaper and more effective way of keeping track of studentsIts drawback is the time involvedas it requires teachers to take register at each lesson by marking pink sheets that are then read into an optical mark readerFrancis Howlettof England's National Council for Educational TechnologyexplainsThe system can give teachers comprehensive information on attendance at the push of a buttonThat could include not only how often each pupil is absentbut also which lessons are being missedwhich teachers are being avoidedand even which ones tend to be absent when the local football team plays at homeRobin Chambersthe principal of Stoke-Newington school in South Londonwhere the programme has been used for two monthssaysWe are ironing out a few difficultiesfor instance getting the individual answer sheet completed in the correct way and working out who has the time to do itBut the machine saves a great deal of time in that it automatically produces statistics and its print-outs clearly show patterns in the absencesWe are able to spot problems earlier on and take actionThe most recent development in anti-truancy technology is the Electronic Attendance Registration System EARSproduced by Bronton Computers at prices varying between Â£8,000 and Â£15,000Teachers retain control of registration keeping the important element of one-to-one contact and perform it in the usual timebut instead of noting absences on paperthey feed the information directly onto a portable electronic register which then passes it to the central computerThe system will be piloted starting from next week by North Westminster Community schoolin Londonwith funds provided by the local authorityAccording to Guy Corbetfrom BroncomEARS allows excellent cross-reference of attendance throughout the school at any time at a fingertipStudents are not given chances to cheatdisappearing after the first registration and retain personal contact with their teachers every dayOf course the system is expensive and while it saves paperwork it does not appear to reduce registration times as suchMeanwhile many secondary schools north of the Border are opting for a cheaper optionthe Scottish Computerised School Administration Programmeor SCAMPThis is a set of databases which collect all the pupils' detailsfrom absences to courses taken and exam presentationsSCAMP speeds the process of filling the absences for the day and by 10amthe school has a complete map of absentees whom they can then begin to check onIts main drawback is that it does not discriminate between authorised and unauthorised absencesBut how do children react to this new electronic scrutinyThere's scope for any system to be alienating and oppressivesays Eric Blythdirector of the Centre for Educational Welfare Studies at Huddersfield UniversityBut we're talking about a generation much more computer-literate than the last and today's children are very unlikely to react badlyHe does point outhoweverthat the technology simply measures attendance it does not improve itThe answer to that may lie closer to home with parentsEric Blyth says the best option is to use the technology along with efforts to make children want to be in schoolWhite Hart Lane School in London used this approach when attendance had slumped to just 72 per centPaul Whitethe project managersaysWe have rooms set aside with comfy chairsmusic and televisions where pupils can go during break or before schoolWe've also introduced rewards for good attendance like pens and key ringswhich are very popular they've even got street credibilitystatusSince the pupil-friendly approach to truancy was introducedattendance has improved by 15 per centThere has also been an unexpected spin-off teacher attendance at the school has improved by 5.1 per centThe anatomy of a classroom truantWHATEVER our image of a truant may be layaboutglue-snifferpetty criminal a recent report from the Scottish Office urges us to dispel a few misunderstandings about truancyThe term covers a vast range of reasons for not attending schoolincluding phobiasparental pressure and the absence of realistic incentives for fourth-year leaversAlthough poverty and family problems enhance the risk of truancythis is not the major factorA child's personalitybe they shyviolentarrogant or insecurecan also lead to skipping schoolLow motivation to attend school has very diverse causestruants may be bored with unchallenging courses or scared by too demanding onesIn extreme cases they develop a real school phobiafor reasons ranging from bullying by classmates to schoolwork anxietyParental attitudes are fundamental in determining the response to truancySome parents may be encouraging their children to help at home or even take up work instead of going to schoolFor these reasons it is suggested that in tackling the problemgood monitoring arrangements should be coupled with an early involvement of school and parentsThe report says home phone calls can be useful but only in high phone-ownership areasand they may be regarded as intrusiveHome visiting is an expensive but helpful alternative for persistent truantsIt urges links between guidance teachers and other agenciessuch as social workeducation welfare officers and children's panelsand to work on a flexible approach to the curriculumenabling fourth year leavers to follow particular classes while performing work

riseBy Alison DanielsPOVERTY and cuts in social security payments are linked to the high number of deaths in Britain each wintercampaigners will tell the Health SecretaryVirginia BottomleytodayDelivering 40,000 ice cubes to the ministerrepresenting the extra number of people who die each winter compared with the number of deaths during the summerthe Campaign for Cold Weather Credits hopes to draw attention to the plight of the poor and the elderlyIn its reportthe organisation denies the Government's claim that there is a significant decrease in the number of winter deathsIt says that evidence shows a sustained increase in deaths since the reform of social security and the withdrawal of heating additions in 1988In Scotlandit estimates the death toll has risen by 7.5 per cent between 1988 and 1991According to Damian Killeenfrom the campaignthere are seven million households in Britain without adequate heatingwith the unemployedthose on low incomes and elderly womenthe most vulnerableThe report states that those who have lived on state pensionsincome support or low payare most likely to live in the most energy-inefficient homes which are incapable of being heated to a minimum comfort standardIt adds that many cannot afford the fuel required to keep even one room warmIt also claims that the UK's winter death rate is twice that of cold countries such as SwedenFinland and Denmarkand suggests that this discrepancy between the UK and other countriesputs in question the Government's focus on factors such as the effect of low temperatures on blood circulationMr Killeen said the organisation was calling on the Government to support proposals for regular weekly payments towards fuel costs for all households in receipt of means tested benefitsPeople in the south-east of England would receive payment of Â£1 while those in the North of Scotland would receive Â£6We also want to see more money spent on the Government's home energy efficiency schemewith all houses in poor physical condition upgraded to a minimum standardHe said the cost of the proposals would be offset by the resulting cut in National Health Service expenditureAt present the NHS spends Â£1 billion treating people with illness related to colddamp housingWe want to see resources redirectedMotoring under a dangerous illusionJane Fowler appreciates her own failings as she takes to the open road with an advanced driving instructorWITH nearly 20 years of trouble-free driving behind meI was relatively confident and assured when I switched on the ignition for my first lesson in advanced drivingI entertained the hope that while one or two lazy habits may have crept inthe passage of years will have added a certain maturity to my conduct behind the wheelI never anticipated humiliationBut Jack McKellarone of the most highly qualified advanced drivers attached to ROSPAthe Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidentsis not entertained by my drivingHe isin factappalledFoot off the clutchhands at ten to twomirroroffside mirrorsignalgearhe barks before I have gone ten yardsDon't sit at a roundabout in firstYour shoes are wetyour foot might

car in front to be able to manoeuvre round it if need beYou won't be able toYou should also see a newsagent on your leftso anticipate a man crossing the road with his nose in a newspaper and children darting across with ice-creams or sweetiesDesperatelyI scan the road for a newsagentWhere is itOhthere it ismiles aheadExactlysays my companionreading my mindand that's where you should be lookingTry to see five miles ahead on a country road and at least two to three hundred yards in a built-up areaAnticipationobservation and concentration should be your watchwordsThere's a garage on your right so look for exhaust fumes someone's about to movethey may pull out without lookingA schoolso watch out for childrenespecially five minutes after the bell has rungWee Johnnie's late and he'll belt across that road no matter whatThere are parked cars to your left so look out for moving feet children might dash outNow tell me what signs we've just passedI try to engage my brain as well as my gearsErI don't knowWellyou shouldSigns exist to make driving safernot to keep the regional council amusedYou are approaching an access road to your lefta side road to your right what is the speed limitNow I want a signI can't see oneForty miles an hourThirtyso why are you doing forty-twoNinety per cent of accidents are caused by people going too fast and there is nevernever an excuse for speedI was late for worktoo badI didn't stand a chance he ran right out in front of meWrongyou didn't anticipate that someone might run outNow what does this sign meanA wiggly bendI offertriumphantlyThere is no such thing as a wiggly bendcomes the swift rebukeYou mean a sharp double bendfirst to the leftthen to the rightSo why aren't you in second gearThe exasperation is growing nowAnd why do you insist on driving over every potholeYou missed one then why don't you go back and get itWhy not indeedWhy not drive straight home here and now and escape this humiliation for which I haveinexplicablyvolunteeredBecause I am aware that 95 per cent of road accidents are unnecessary and thatgiven the indices of probabilityunless I improve my driving I too will join the crash victimsWith three young children usually ensconced in the back of my carthis is a prospect I do not relishBut here I am without the distracting offspring and drivingor attempting to do sowith care and concentrationWhat is going wrongYou're no worse than the restsays my instructoroffering one small crumb of comfortBut we live in a society where we are ruled by the clockA few seconds delay at a junction and we regard it as minutesWe race constantly so it is not surprising that 90 per cent of accidents are caused by excess speedFive hundred people are killed annually in Scotland alone and the Lothian branch of ROSPA are currently running better drivingcourses every Wednesday eveningThese are free and demand has been so great that what was initially planned as a single four-week course has been extended to sessions running until the springDrivers are offered talks illustrated with videos followed at the end of the course by an assessment of driving with an advanced instructorPositioningmotorway and winter driving are some of the subjects covered but the night I attended the subject was speedThe videoswhich did not include the guts and gore of crasheswere nevertheless disturbingThe lectures were delivered in an unpatronising way with useful informationTake the factfor examplethat a quiet residential road is one of the most dangerous since the driver has a perception of being in a wideopen space and feels he is driving slower than he actually isOne video shows two drivers on a private circuitBoth attempt to go as fast as possibleThe good driver accelerates wellcorners well and understands his carThe bad driver goes even faster but shows no acceleration sense and skids repeatedlyAs in the best of parablesthe good driver wins he who drives more carefully actually gets there fasterPerhaps a little contrived but Paul Richardsona road safety officer taking the classcites a more practical exampleTake the journey from Edinburgh to Glasgowsay from the Newbridge roundabout to the outskirts of GlasgowImagine you did the entire 45-mile journey at 70 mphyou would take 41 minutesDrive it at 90 mph and you would take 36 minutesWhat do you do with your extra five whole minutesif you actually make itHave a cup of tea to recoverIT is stressed that the braking distances learned for that driving test many years back are not idle theoryMost people naively imagine they will stop immediately when they jam on the brakesYet at only 30 miles an hourthe braking distance is 45 feetStopping distance that isthe time it takes for the brain to register the need to stop and the time it takes for the brake to take effect is at 70 miles an hour a frightening 315 feetI revise my decision to abandon my first lesson and ask Jack McKellar if any drivers are particularly to blame business peoplelorry drivers or journalists with three childrenAnyone who drives too fastis his simple answerIn Americathey call advanced driving defensive drivingand that's what it isLearn to decelerate out of trouble rather than accelerate into itAs we continue our lessonI manage to keep my speed downkeep my foot off the clutch except when changing geartake heed of the signs wellmost of them and watch for potential hazards both near and farI feel I am making progressYou're doing a million things wrongis Jack's final summing upIf I point out all your mistakesI'll shatter your confidenceThe key to good driving is careconcentration and watching the speedThe ugly truth about being a glamour pussMy thighs are so wobbly that each day I thank God that my stomach covers themWHAT IS happening todayHas someone turned the clock back 100 years and forgotten to tell mePerhaps I have just become too comfortable with the cheering notion that women are far too busy getting on with their careers and their lives to crucify themselves worrying about ragged cuticles or the size of their anklesStupidlyI presumed that the ancient axiom that females were put on this planet for purely decorative purposes or that being pretty or perhaps a spot of procreationwere the pinnacles of achievement had forever died out alongside the bustle and/or the bubble carBut noWe're still talking about Fiona Armstrong's calves and debating fulsomely about the length of hemlinesAnd how enervatinghow disappointinghow absolutelycrushing to realise that nothing has changed over the last few decades at leastand that for many womentheir primary response is still to be beautiful rather than brainyAnd why the hell notThe current status quo demands that others remain more interested in the size of one's bust rather than the size of one's IQAnd good grief the news that it is successful and powerful females saying this is enough to make strong women weep into their double ginsOr should that be double chinsThis latest bulletin is so depressingI put on 6lbs just thinking about itAnd do you know somethingI don't careReallyFay Weldon of all people should know betterIn a volte-face that makes Germaine Greer's change of heart look like a tiny emotional triflethe former feminists' champion has switched from the red corner to the blue corner without a blush in the processThe author of The Fat Woman's Joke and The Life and Loves of a She Devil has suddenly decided that being one of Britain's highest paid and smartest novelists who can command fees of Â£200,000 per book simply isn't enoughI used to think that you should always be yourself but now I like to be made upsmile and look like a woman shouldpreens Fayshe addedLooking good on your book jackets means that more people will read youOh reallyI can't recall Alexander SolzhenitsynJeffrey ArcherFrederick Forsyth and Uncle Tom Cobley and all looking luscious on any of their best-selling titlesThere isof coursenothing wrong with trying to look your bestbut for the born-again Weldon to refuse to see anyone unless she spent half the day in the hairdressers and then proclaim that she's only doing it to further her career ohpleasesmacks of hypocrisy of the very highest orderWhat she is really sayingafter all this timeis that it is more important for a woman than a man to look goodSadlythis makes all her high moral stances and her bonny sights of yesteryear come tumbling down like a house of cardsAnd weeponce morefor Steffi Graf who was hot off the baseline this week with a whingeing moan about her physiqueGraf is one of the world's top tennis players whose supreme athleticism and guts have put her at the top of a very tough professionIs this enoughOf course notI am no

smile or her pretty blonde hairNot that you're interestedbut my thighs are so wobbly that each day I thank God that my stomach covers themIf I had a physique as powerful and beautiful as Graf'sI'd use the strength to knock some sense into her daft headWho does she want to look likeVanessa Paradis or Michelle PfeifferSometimes despair is the only optionAnd what about Body Shop supremo Anita Roddickthe woman who has been feted for the last ten years as some kind of environmentally conscious feminist iconI have always been deeply suspicious of Roddick and her cliche-ridden slogans and highly-publicised efforts to save the worldwhile quietly amassing a fortune on the sideI never bought that stuff about her ever-expanding conscience and I certainly never bought any of her beauty productsLifefor meis certainly not too short to stuff a mushroomHoweverit is at least ten million years too short to spend an evening piddling about with peppermint footbaths or rainforest elixir ear-lobe exfoliatorsBut waitAnita the fabled feminist has a complaint she want you all to hearShe thinks it is simply awful that being successful and reading the ill-camouflaged sub-textgorgeous means that men won't chat her upadmire her breasts or perceive her as a sexual creatureAnita doesn't want to save the planet any moreShe wants to save her self-esteemShe has decided that pretty compliments from members of the opposite sex are whatafter allis important in this lifeAnyone viewing all this nonsense from another planet as most men do can be forgiven for assuming that women are a bunch of mixed up crazies who don't know what they wantbut do know that they want it allboth ways and with jam on the toptooNo-one can deny that being pretty helps no female on breakfast television would have a career otherwise but I cannot believe that we are turning back to the dark days when it was deemed the most important thing of allThe recent controversies over both the Maastricht amendment and Workfare serve to betray the Conservatives' real economic aim of making Britain the low wage centre of EuropeSuggestions of obligating the unemployed to work for their benefits are quite in keeping for a Government which has done virtually everything else it can to ensure that millions of Britons will work for derisory incomesThe hobbling of trade unionsthe abolition of wages councilsand the refusal to legislate for minimum pay levels demonstrate that John Major is quite willing to oversee the worsening of living standards for a large part of the populationAny Workfare or similar scheme will heighten the problem by providing a cheap labour pool which will discourage the creation of real jobs with acceptable conditionsTied in by their own dogmathe Conservatives refuse to take any steps to build a genuine base for sustained economic growthUnless the Government crosses this ideological barrier and invests in educationtraining and infrastructurethen the spiral of increasing unemployment and low pay looks likely to continueBland caseWithout in any way making light of the distress of the parents of Tony Blandit is very important to keep a firm hold of the fact that Tony himself was not reported to be in any pain or distressso any change in the treatment he was receiving was not for the purpose of relieving acute suffering of the patientOne must wonderthereforehow his dignity was to be maintained by the withdrawal of feedingThe case is not entirely a private family matter since it has very serious implications for society as a wholeWhat we have now had thrust upon us is a precedent to hasten deathnot really to help the patient die with dignity but to accommodate the judgment of others that the patient's life is no longer possessed of qualityA hard caseand I am not disputing that for the Bland parents it is indeed a very hard case has been found which canand I believe willbe skilfully exploited to justify the dignifiedremoval of a subtly-expanding range of people who will be deemed to be living lives which are below some expert'scriterion of an acceptable standardProphets do not have a track record of popularity star-rating but they provein the endto

relegated to obscurityGross biasPhillip Whidden Points of View3 Februaryaddresses my earlier criticism of the report by the Association of Non-Smokers Rights claiming that passive smokingcauses over 10,000 deaths annually in BritainHe justifies failure to cite critics of the Wells paper on which the ANSR estimates were basedbecause these critics were mistakenWhether or not the criticisms were mistaken and many were notfailure even to notice themlet alone reply to themindicates gross bias in the ANSR reportMr Whidden cites the US Environmental Protection Agency report as support for his view that passive smokingcauses deaths from lung cancer in non-smokersstating that it ran the gauntlet of scientific criticismCertainly there were many criticisms of earlier draftsI attended two open meetings in Washington in which the EPA received comments from numerous sourcesIt was notable that many valid criticismsincluding some from its own scientific advisory boardwere totally ignored in the final reportIt is interesting that Mr Whidden does not cite the EPA report as regards heart disease or other cancersdiseases which contribute nearly all of the total of ANSR's spurious estimate of deathsCould this be because the EPAlike the UK Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Healthdid not conclude that an effect of passive smokingwas demonstratedIt is also interesting that Mr Whidden fails to point out that no authoritative report has claimed passive smokingcauses chronic bronchitis in adultsThe solicitors for Stockport Metropolitan Borough Councilwhich paid out Â£15,000 compensation to Veronica Blandhave confirmed that reports in the media may have given the false impression that such a relationship has been establishedNeitherfor the recordwas there any admission of liability and in no way was it conceded that passive smokingcaused her alleged illnessThe country is horrified by the upsurge in violent crimetypified by the killing of young James BulgerBut what is

franticallyNot one but two former homes secretaries have blamed television and films for what is happening in societyLord Merlyn-Reesa former Labour ministersuggested children are copying what they see on televisionwhile the Conservatives' Kenneth Baker claimed children faced a moral vacuum and that television and film are at least partly to blameTelevision bosses maintain they have tight controls on TV violencewhile the film censor claims to operate one of the toughest regimes in the western worldLethal Weapon 2 got a U certificate in Francebut the British censor wouldn't even pass it for over-18s without some of the violence being cutBaker expressed grave concern at the Bootle killing and attacked various institutions for the fact that society has become more violent and selfishHe suggested the Church should concentrate its message on violence rather than offering a view on the Social ChapterThere is one group that politicians seem reluctant to blame and that's themselvesThere have been several cases in the past where it appeared people were acting out violent scenes from filmsIt was suggested the Hungerford killer Michael Ryan was influenced by the film character RamboBut there is no evidence of such a direct link between the Bootle killing and screen violenceand many people may find such speculation insensitive and distasteful at this stageSome maintain violent programmes do encourage violent behaviour and something needs to be doneSome argue that violent programmes are cathartica safe release for aggressive feelingsThere's no shortage of opinionsHard evidence is difficult to come byRecent studies have posed the question as to whether there is a link between film violence and real violence and have come up with the answer that the majority of people think there isthough at least one study concluded the oppositeBut such research only reveals people's perceptionsIt doesn't evaluate whether they are right or notJohn Daviesprofessor at Strathclyde University's Centre for Occupational and Health Psychologysays these studies merely muddy the waterHe accepts it's extremely difficult to come up with conclusive evidence that violent films cause violent behaviourbut that a series of studies in America 20 years ago suggested it was a factorThe US research employed observation of childrenquestionnaires and long-term case studiesNevertheless the results were highly controversial and Sue Elliottthe official in charge of children's television at Britain's Independent Television Commission watchdogsaysExtensive research on both sides of the Atlantic has not established a clear link between watching violent television and violent behaviourMany people would say that even the possibility of a link would justify actionbut the ITC already has detailed restrictions and before jerking one's knee it's necessary to know the nature of the material that may be subject to cutsElliott saysTelevision is an easy scapegoat for people's anger when inexplicable acts of violence shock societyPoliticians should hesitate before reaching for the handy blame televisionsolutionThey know less about and watch less television than anyone else in the countryScottish Television produces about 40 per cent of ITV children's programmingAlistair Moffatthe station's director of programmessaysThe superheroes have goneHe-Man and wham-bang-crash has goneThe shows that top the ratings are softfor example we make Rupert the Bear and that gets a 60 per cent share of the kidsaudienceOlder children prefer humour to violencesays Moffatand when it comes to watching adult televisionthey like nothing better than soaps like Neighbours and Home and Awaywhich may tackle tough issuesbut approach them with a certain old-fashioned moralityand contain little violenceAnything shown before 9pm is regarded as family viewing and Elliott says the ITC has done extensive research on The Billa police dramato check the impact on its sizeable audience of childrenMoffat reckons the real cause for concern is satellite television and videoSome kids will take the video club membership card out of mum's purse and will go

banned both on video and in the cinema in this countryJames Fermandirector of the British Board of Film ClassificationsaysWe are one of the most censorious countries in the world regarding violenceWe are very concerned about violence and always have beenThis is in spite of the fact that he believes there's no evidence that watching violence on screen leads to violence in real lifeThere are some cases where the link appears to be quite closeSometimes it's a matter of the dripdripdrip effect and seeing too much violence and not being as sensitive to violence as one should beCertainly our classification policy is very much based on what kind of violence is safe to be seen at various agesAlthough media attention has focused on specific filmssuch as Reservoir Dogswhich show graphically realistic instances of violenceit may be the more routine violence of the Lethal Weapon and Die Hard action movies that should be causing most concernThe hero uses violence in an almost casual way and the consequences are never properly addressedIt's a type of violence that falls between realism and fantasyThe ITC guidelines make it clear that it doesn't see sanitisedviolence as innocuous and Ferman expresses greater concern about Lethal Weapon 2 than Reservoir DogsFerman believes every possible factor must be considered after the Bootle killingincluding films but also parental responsibilityOne of the things that worries me is too many parents allow their kids to see videos classified 15 or 18Something has to be done about it to make parents realise that these are classified as unsuitable for children because they genuinely are unsuitable for childrenDavies says there is some evidence to suggest that showing the consequences of violence is preferable to not doing soBut he feels it all has an effectincluding Tom and Jerrywhich is after all non-stop violenceHe recalls that US researchers came up with a list of programmes of which they approvedincluding The Waltonsand those of which they disapprovedincluding the old Batman serieswith its camp humour and captions saying Powwhen he punched the baddiePressed on whether he would ban Tom and JerryDavies says he wouldn'tHe recalls one study suggested that if you present youngsters with a diet of relentlessly insipid programmes then that in itself may stir up aggressive tendencies and encourage violenceAddressing aggressionthe British censor wouldn't pass Lethal Weapon 2 for over-18s without some of the violence being cutCENTRAL Edinburgh does notat a glancelook like an unemployment

longer guaranteed a generous redundancy packageMr Edwards saidThere was a time when bonuses would be generous and the person might work several months noticeNow packages are being refined and people are being asked to leave more quicklyIt is partly the recession and partly companies taking a realistic look at how much they can affordMany of the people who were made redundant during the first wave of financial job losses in 1990 have found work in other fieldsAdministrative posts have been snapped up by stockbrokers and merchant bankersNobody feels secure any moresaid Mr EdwardsYounger people

spite of forthcoming local government reorganisationhe has not forgotten how his brief spell of unemployment affected himThere are two sides to unemploymenton the one hand it can be a productive time as you start to question things and think harder about what road you want to go downHoweverit can also make you disorientated and you start to apply for less and less appropriate jobs as you get desperateYou start to see yourself in terms of an application formLike others in the streethe is not enchanted with the idea of working for dole moneyTo me it sounds similar to youth training schemes a disgraceSome sort of scheme would be reasonablebut only if there was training involved and a decent wageNo.11DIANE LECKIE39is divorcedwith a daughter and works as a teacherShe vividly recalls being

contractsproper jobs are very hard to come byThere are a lot of very qualified people who can only find work on a short-term basisSwedish lessonJ R Hall Points of View12 Februaryis right to suggest that British Rail would be able to make a profit if the Government took full responsibility for funding the provision and maintenance of railway infrastructure as it does roadsThis view is substantiated by experience in Swedenwhere such an arrangement has existed since 1988As a resultthe state railways turned a loss of 416 million kroner about Â£40 millionthat year into a profit of 28 million kroner the following yearwhich grew to 372 million kroner in 1990 and is expected to go on risingThe state railways pay a user charge to the track authoritywhich is broadly equivalent to the charges faced by road users and covers only about a third of total infrastructure costsSo successful has the state system been that it has lost only about 1 per cent of its operations to a private competitor under the system of tendering for the provision of local passenger services that was also introduced by the 1988 rail reformsIt is misleadingthereforeof the Government to hold up Sweden as a model for its madcap rail privatisation plansIndeedSwedish railway executives have publicly condemned the proposals as unworkableTown allergiesProfessor A Seaton suggests Points of Viewtodaythat the Rev J L Leckie's view that traffic pollution has caused the rise in the prevalence of asthma in Aberdeen school-children is simplisticBut Mr Leckie must be partly rightProfessor Robert Daviesof Bart'shas pointed out that exhaust pollution explains the curious fact that city dwellers these days are more affected by hay fever than those in the countryBoth these allergic conditions have the same underlying causea dysfunctioning immune systemTherefore all immunosuppressive factors can play a partThese include chemical allergens exhaust fumes and tobacco smoke among themfood allergens too often overlooked by asthma specialistsand physical and psychological stressTheir effects are cumulativethere is no single answer in cell-mediated allergyThe problem of congestion on the Forth Road Bridge and on the approaches to Edinburgh remains unresolvedSome people suggest that the removal of tolls would help to solve the difficulties to a great extentThey may well be rightbut are unable to prove their pointLet us suspend the tolls for a period of say14 daysso that we can all see if they are rightIf they arethere will be no need for an extra bridge and the projected cost of a second bridge could be used to strengthen the present structureCompared with the billions being spent out of the road fund in England to make the motorways even widerthe cost would be chicken-feedInfallible way to obtain release from military serviceAs a former National Service army medical officerI was much entertained by Albert Morris's reminiscences Conscripts who altered the script8 Februaryof the various ingenious methods used by unwilling conscripts to obtain their discharge from the serviceHaving spent some weeks in 1951 as medical officer to a basic training regiment in AldershotI recall with amusement many of the subterfuges and deceptions described by Albert MorrisHoweverI am surprised that he failed to mention persistent bed-wetting whichin my experiencewas the one absolutely infallible method of obtaining release from military serviceDuring my time in the army a regimental quartermaster who was repeatedly having to exchange soiled blankets would protest so vehemently to his commanding officer that drastic action had to be takenThis initially meant that the bed-wetter would be made to sleep in the guard-roomwhere during the night he would be wakened hourly for toilet purposesIf after perhaps two weeks of this regimen the bed-wetting continuedthen the enuretic National Serviceman would probably be referred by the unit medical officer to the local military hospital for exclusion of urologicalneurological or psychiatric disordersThis processof courseusually meant several hospital visitswith consequent very welcome respite from tiresome and disagreeable activities such as drill paradesguard dutiescookhouse fatigues and physical trainingThese medical investigations hardly ever revealed any physical or mental abnormality and if the bed-wetter continued thereafter to deplete the quartermaster's stock of blankets then the British Army had no answer to this situation other than to discharge him honourably from the service without a stain on his characterwhatever there might be on his bedclothesI do not know how the RAF dealt with bed-wetters in the days of National Servicebut I am certain that even although the Royal Navy had abandoned hammocks not long after the Second World Wara persistent enuretic on board a warship would create even more serious problems than he could in an army barracksWorkers' rightsIt can only be a reliance on public ignorance that can allow the Foreign SecretaryDouglas Hurdand other Toriesto spread lies about the social chapter of the Maastricht treatyMr Hurd has talked about these articles as if they were about the imposition of old East European socialismwith Chancellor Kohl leading the wayArticle 2which sets out the general areas of workers' rightssimply spells out many rights that already exist in lawor have been present in well-unionised work places for years before ThatcherismArticle 6 reinforces the legal rights on equal pay obtained by women in this countryin 1970Without any exaggerationit would be true to say thatapart from Tory ideologuesthe overwhelming majority of people in this country would agree to this legislationif they were given the chance to read it and in more simple termsThe Toriesand their ruling-class supporterswish to keep the ordinary worker from knowing what the substance of this social chapter ishow it really just gives more backing to much of what they have already gained through industrial struggles for nearly 200 yearsand the extension of these rights to every workerespecially the more isolated onesThe Tories want to trample over the workersparticularly through the instrument of unemployment which has already frightened workers into accepting wage cuts such as at CambuslangThe social chapter would not provide any protection here as pay policy is excludedapart from the equal pay issuebut in terms of social security and employment conditionsit would be an important advanceHoweverwhat is most galling is the inactivity of the party which is supposed to represent labourA high-powered focus on this issuealongside the campaign on the health servicewould undoubtedly have won the Labour Party the general electionBridge across Labour's class divideShould he stay or should he goLabour needs Tom Clarke to remain shadow Scottish secretarysays Peter JonesAT least one Labour MPand probably a few morethink that Labour leader John Smith should ditch his troubled shadow Scottish secretary Tom Clarkewho went back to work in January after a three-month illness and promptly inflicted two unnecessary controversies upon himselfThat Labour MP ishoweverbound to be disappointedIt is not in Smith's interestsor the Labour Party'sfor Clarke to be summarily dispatched like some allegedly politically incorrect Daily Mirror employeeFor the issue at stake is not necessarily whether Clarke is good or bad at his jobsomething which is indeed a topic of conversation among MPsnot just among the media's very well-paid political hacksas Clydesdale MP Jimmy Hood asserted this weekIt has much more to do with control of the party's thinking and its power structuresthe debate about modernisation of ideology and whether or not the Scottish party should become more or less independent of the rest of the UK Labour PartyThese debatesespecially the ideological oneare difficult enough for Smith to manageand they would get worse in Scotland if Clarke was put to the swordThey would also be worse than the ruckus stirred up by Clarke's remarks on firstlythe improbability of Labour being able to renationalise a privatised water industryand secondlythe worthlessness of the Scottish financial industryThe first was a mistake whichall politicians will tell youis easily made and relatively simple to correct with a few carefully worded statements and some abuse of the mediaThe second is not so easy to explain awayfor it implied a fundamental incomprehension of the financial industrymany of whose 200,000 employees are Labour voters in marginal Edinburgh seatsAnd it is that point which has raised questions in the minds of some MPs who hitherto have been relatively happy with ClarkeStillone bad speech does not merit a sackingAnd although there are some MPs who think Clarke should go now to prevent any worse gaffesit is only on past events rather than future possibilities that such decisions can be madeAnd certainly there would be the most almighty row if Clarke got the pushWhat was interesting about those MPs who were swift to defend him was that they come from the traditional working-class wing of the parliamentary party people like Jimmy Hoodor Aberdeen North's Bob HughesNow they are the sort of MPs who are most likely to support traditional Labour policieswhich Clarkeon the hypothetical question of water renationalisationwas implicitly rejectingClearlyon the evidence of Hood's letters of defence in the press this weekthey support himnot because of what he saysbut because of what he is fromand still part ofa traditional working-class backgroundAccording to Hoodthe criticisms of Clarke are born from jealousy and political snobberyIt has to be said that there has been for some years within the Labour Party something of a class divide a working-class element resentful of a middle-class takeover by lawyers and the likeThe divide has been bridged in a number of waysone being shadow Cabinet elections putting people like Tom Clarke or John Prescott into the upper echelonsNeil Kinnock also bridged that dividebut John Smith is definably and obviously on the middle-class side of itSmith therefore needs people like Tom Clarke in the shadow CabinetTurf him out of itand the debate between traditionalistsand moderniserscould well turn into a conflagrationThe row over what Labour would do with the water industry is a graphic first flare-up in that debateIt is potentially hugely divisive given the Scottish party's left-wing sensibilitiesbut less so if working-class traditionalists like Clarke can go down Smith's route to modernityThe water debatewhen couched in terms of the Scottish party's rights to determine policy in specifically Scottish areasalso directly affects the current internal demands for more Scottish party autonomyeven unto independenceThis argumentthat the Scottish party should elect its own leaderraise its own fundshire and fire its own staff and sit in a Westminster coalition with the English and Welsh Labour Partyis something which acutely interests a few hundred activistsbut not many MPsand one guessesprecious few votersBut if John Smith was cavalierly hiring and firing the shadow Scottish secretarysome more MPs might start taking an interestwhich would be wholly undesirable in the leader's officeSo Clarke will stayBut he has done himself some damage and will need to work hardand with some careif he is to secure re-election to the shadow Cabinet in NovemberForaccording to the soundings taken by The Scotsman this weekhe would not win

pictures cannot describe the disaster that is unfolding in former YugoslaviaHistory will deliver a harsh judgment on the politicians and warlords who are fermenting this chaos but I doubt if there are enough prison cells in Europe to hold all the war criminalsAnd we should not forget that ham-fisted European diplomacy contributed to the re-balkanisation of the Balkans by hastening to recognise unrecognisable statesWe cannot abandon people to the horrors of primitive siege warfareso the ramshackle institutions of the United Nations will have to be drastically overhauled to cope with this crisis and others like it which are festering in an increasingly unstable worldThe official mandate of the United Nations Protection Force is to ride shotgunwith relief convoysbut the British battalion has stretched that mandate into a peacemaking roleIt is no criticism of the FrenchSpanishCanadian and other contingents that the circumstances in their sectors have not permitted such tacticsbut if the Vance-Owen plan is to be implemented we will need to apply the pro-active approach which is being pioneered by the Cheshire RegimentCharacteristicallyand with the benefit of years of experience in Ulsterthis UK infantry regiment has extended its presence and its influence well beyond its camps and convoysTheir supporting Engineers are making roadsrebuilding bridges and the Cheshires are imposing their influence on local factions by both persuasion and forceThat has meant returning fire to suppress Croats and others who fire on the UN forceIt has also involved brokering deals to reduce tension in other areasThistogether with patrolling and gathering intelligence about the areameans that the UK element of UNPROFOR is doing the groundwork for implementation of the Vance-Owen settlement planThat has been achieved despite the restricted terms of the UN Resolutiondespite hopelessly inadequate and confused UN structuresand also despite the half-hearted attitude of British ministers at the outsetBut for the initiative of General Morillon and his transplanted European NATO staffand of the individual units in UNPROFOR and various aid agenciesthe whole operation would be hopelessly bogged downIndeedit is going to be bogged down unless the UN can get things moving with political and military action to make the peace plan workThings are bad enough now but if there is no sign of progress towards a settlementthe people who are still giving friendly waves to UN troops are likely to start throwing stones as they do in Northern IrelandThe UN must start driving the momentum towards peaceIndeed if they fail to take the initiative they might as well abandon the people of the area to a grim fateTwo things are requiredsubstantially more UN forcesalmost certainly including Americansand a UN supremo with direct authority from the Secretary General to drive the politicaldiplomatichumanitarian and military process forwardWhile US forces are neededYugoslavia is no place for a massive Stormin' Normanstyle of operationThe terrain and the highly armed militias would soon remind them of VietnamThe Americans would be well advised to learn from the British and others who have experience in the areaAnd the operation must be seen to be multinationalso the UK contingent should ideally be increased to brigade strength which underlines the case for reprieving the Highland regimentsThe need for better coordination cannot be overstatedWith inadequate communications between UN unitsrudimentary command and control structuresgovernments interpreting the UN resolution in different waysrelief supplies being administered through a totally separate UN agencyand the Vance-Owen initiative developing at another level altogetherit is hardly surprising that the international effort can appear confusedBoutros Boutros-Ghali must get the Security Council to agree an effective new Resolution and to appoint a special representative with comprehensive authority to do whatever is necessary to make a settlement workA top flight soldier with diplomatic skills would fit the billWe have avoided mass starvation in former Yugoslavia this wintersome time has been bought and soldiers and relief agencies have begun to develop strategies to begin to restore orderIt is vital that the United Nations should now act on that groundwork and drive the peacemaking process forwardIt is going to be difficult and expensivebut the only alternative is to abandon millions of people to an even worse fateIf the UN can set a precedent for peacemaking in the Balkans we

trying to make him take action against the MobAs you judge her storyyou may care to remember her considerable grievancesShe says she was taken to the Plaza Hotelto a party where Hoover sat in a fine black frock and insisted on being called Maryafter a whilehe retired to the bedroom to be petted by two bought boysone of whom prudently wore rubber glovesIf you wanted to invent a perfectly stereotyped queerthis is the story you'd tell down to the name Maryand the fact that his sexual partners were youngand prostitutesAnd just after the supposed orgyas Summers admits but in an end-notethe FBI began heavy surveillance of Meyer Lansky supposedly the blackmailer-in-chiefBut if this really was the sum of Hoover's sexuality sadmean and sporadica slight release from the need to control himself utterly he seems almost pitiableIt helps explain his fixation on the details of other people's erotic livesthe keyhole stuff that filled his filesthe anger envyperhaps which made him project homosexuality onto all manner of public figuresFor J Edgar Hooverhappiness was just another kind of disorderAT firstthe politicians thought they could run HooverAt the request of FDRHoover opened files on anyone who opposed the president's line on national defence and tried to intimidate press critics like the Chicago TribuneFDR allowed Hooveran officialto by-pass Cabinet members and come directly to the presidentin timethis back channel made Hoover uncontrollableAnd he extended Hoover's powersWiretappingtechnically illegalwas first authorised in 1940 the FBI had used itof coursebefore thatWhat Hoover could not doas usualwas the real jobFor thathe needed not just hundreds of incorruptible field agents writing down what they overheardbut also analysts able to detect when people were jokingsome of the oddest accusationslike Eleanor Roosevelt's supposed affair with two lefty trades unionistscome from the agents' innocence of dirty jokesHoover couldn't even see the point of intelligence reports which showed Japan's interest in how to attack a deep harbourand how deep Pearl Harbour might beThe OSSfore-runner of the CIAwas born out of his obtusenessand remained his bitter rivalHoover feuded with the CIA for decades and evenin 1970shocked Washington by breaking relations between the agencies altogetherThat's a reasonincidentallyfor caution on stories of photographs glimpsed at the end of dinners for OSS veterans the pictures of Edgar on his kneesmaking love to ClydeIf they existthese pictures come from specialists in disinformation with a grudgeBut for all his incompetence in wartimeHoover was now settled in the Washington game privilegedsanctifiedunbudgeable and with more and more information to useHe'd tell presidents about their appointeespromise appointees and Senators he'd suppressed their fileslet certain papers know on plain paperin plain envelopes what he'd overheard or snatch-shot or been toldThis powerSummers sayswas what brought Lyndon Johnson Hoover's old allyeven though he called him that queer bastardonto the ticket with John Kennedy in 1960Hoover knew how the Mob helped Kennedy buy votesmore to the pointhe knew about Kennedy's skirt-chasingThe Kennedy brothers went away to consider who'd be vice-presidentand named their loudest rivalLBJThey promised never to tell why but it wasSummers saysHoover's blackmailBy nowHoover was a politicians' nightmare perceived by some as the perfect copbut known at close range for his rantshis sexual obsessionshis card index and his file cabinets which by now contained all the sinsreal and imaginedof the political worldHe's rather a psychoRobert Kennedy saidoff the recordin 1964I think he's become senileand ratherfrighteningBut the Kennedys needed his special protection racket to destroy phone company records when Marilyn Monroe committed suicidefor exampleor to leak FBI reports that disproved stories suggesting John Kennedythe good Catholic boywas actually on his second marriageAnd when Kennedy was shotthe psychoHoover botched the FBI investigation personallyignoring evidence that there might have been more than a single gunman involvedsending agents to question the background of the Warren Commission's staffpunishing his own agents for failing to spot Oswald's violent natureHe went from briefing the new president that evidence against Oswald was too weak for a conviction to insisting that Oswald was the manIt's tempting to scent conspiracy did Hoover stall investigations which might lead to the Mobwho held those compromising

control on the depiction of extreme violence on films and videosThere is a clear trend for films to become increasingly violent and sadisticwith each new film trying to outdo the last in savageryThis must have a major part to play in the increasing mindless violence of young peopleimitating what they have been encouraged to believe is entertainmentnamely torturemurder and cannibalismThe greatest danger comes from videoswhere it is impossible to limit the age of the viewerWhat is now required is a law making it a crime to act inproducedistribute or sell films and videos depicting cruel and excessive violenceThose responsible should be charged with incitement to commit crimes of violenceEven if only one innocent person's life is savedit will be worthwhileThe producers of films should be aiming to bring pleasure and entertainmentnot pandering to the lowest savage instincthowever profitable that may beRespect for human life is surely worth more than easy profitPrice mysteryI read

dirgeHow often does it have to be demonstrated that Flower of Scotland is a good pub/folk song but is manifestly unsuitable as a national anthemAt Ibrox on Wednesday night we heard the usual rammy of an unco-ordinated band and throng and a pipe bandI regret to sayonly compounds the offenceand pretty awful it sounded on the radioGratitude that the Scottish Football Association and Scottish Rugby Union have apparently stopped insulting us with Scotland the Brave is not reason enough to allow them to inflict the people's choiceupon usThis emotional dirgealbeit popular and heartfeltis just not the right stuffScots Wha Haewhich some may claim is another emotional dirgehas tremendous credentials tune going back to the 14th century and words by our national bardIt only needs a slightly

everyday worldAccording to your editorial today Filling the vacuumtake all violence out of television drama and you disconnect it from realitywhose realityTelevision is already about as divorced from the realeveryday world as it could possibly bePerhaps one of the reasons why we are faced with the menace of increasing savagery among a minority of the young is that they fail to realise that TV is not a window on the worldbut a structure of smallangledmirrors reflecting different viewpointsI remember the editor of ITN saying at a meeting in the 1960s that he sometimes wished he could precede every bulletin withNinety-nine per cent of the people in the world went about their lives today without anything unusual happening to themThis bulletin contains items about what happened to some of the other 1 per centMan's inhumanity to man makes nations interestedThis is why current affairs programmes concentrate so much on doom and gloomeven away from the big stories of the dayThe lives of articulate people can be more interesting than fictionbut in general they would bore viewers more than the new vogue of delving into every aspect of sexual behaviour in discussion programmesWhy are these producers so fascinated by sexIn a country where teenage rape and murder are on the increasedo we really need this salaciousness and is it responsible to show a programme which lingers over the grisly reminiscences of a psychotic serial murdererAgainbombarding the young day by day with fictitious views of the sordid side of human life can distort their view of the worldPerhaps now that Morsewith its lack of overt sex or violencehas in recent weeks achieved the highest rating of any current programmeproducers and writers may realise that delving into the same old muck no longer wins large audiencesThey may realise also that to do so is perhaps a reflection of their own inability to create the excellent plot structurecharacterisation and atmosphere of this successful seriesOld

Road Track CostsThe current edition breaks down expected road expenditure and the tax-take from road users for the current financial year and showsas previous editions have donethat road users cover their track costs by a factor of 2.4 to 1In other words users of all typesfrom motor-cyclists to the owners of the heaviest vehiclespay almost two and a half times as much in taxes as is spent on all

special relationshipthat marked the Reagan and Bush years has gone and there is plenty of scope for disagreement over a packed agendaEwen MacAskill reports Face to face and an eyeful of the oppositionTHERE are few guarantees in politics but it is a more than reasonable bet that John Major and Bill Clinton will both be smiling and behaving as if they are buddies when they give a press conference at the White House tomorrow afternoonEven if they have found the previous hour of talks excruciating finding they have little in common on a whole host of difficult issuesthey will come out smilingThere is apprehension in Downing Street andto a lesser extentat the White House over the first meeting between the new president and the Prime MinisterThe nervousness in Downing Street is evident in the extent to which Major and his officials have been stressing since Clinton's election that the two have a potentially good relationshipDowning Street repeatedly points out the two have had friendly telephone callsBut the more Downing Street proteststhe greater the suspicion that Major is jittery about US-UK relationsMajor will spend tomorrow morning on Capitol Hill in discussion with party leaders and have lunch at the British Embassy with further US movers and shakersincluding the head of the Central Intelligence AgencyAt 3pmhe will meet Clinton and the two will be together for the next six hoursan indication that the president regards the Prime Minister's visit as more than just a courtesy callThey have a long agenda that includes the GATT trade talks and a host of foreign issuesincluding IraqBosniaRussia andto British embarrassmentNorthern IrelandBut British officials yesterday put at the top of the agenda the personal relationship between the two menhow the two will get on face to faceOne official said that the two shared a similar background and were of a similar age and added thatknowing the Prime Ministerhe was sure they would establish a rapportThe initial problem is that Major is a Conservative and Clinton is a Democratand although party differences are not necessarily a bar to a good relationshipthe problem has been compounded by two incidents during the US election campaignOne was a visit by two Conservatives from Tory Central Office in London to give advice to the Bush campaignThe Republicans had been impressed by Major's election victory in Aprilfelt there were useful lessons to be learned and invited two political advisersAlthough the two are not regarded in London as senior Conservative strategiststheir presence was resented by the Clinton campThe other incident was when the Home Office investigated files on Clinton's time at Oxford as a Rhodes scholarThis was interpreted in the Clinton camp as the Major government attempting to give Bush a hand by digging up dirt on Clinton as a Vietnam draft-dodger or pot-smokerWhen Major visited Washington in Decemberhe had expected to see ClintonBut Clinton refused to leave his home state of Arkansas and this was interpreted as a snub to MajorThe Downing Street line on the Home Office incident was that it had been a junior official who had gone through the files to help answer journalists' inquiries about Clintonnot to help the Bush Administration As for the Conservative Central Office foray to the USthe Government remains uneasy about thisBritish officialsrehearsing for questions from US journalistsattempted to distance themselvesFirstlythey pointed out that as government officialsparty matters were not relevant to themMore significantlythe Government yesterday made the biggest effort yet to defuse the row by saying the two Central Office officials' visit had been cleared by the Tory chairmanSir Norman Fowlerbut Major himself had known nothing about itClinton is said not to be seeking revengebut others in his Administration are bitterA source at the US Embassy in London dismissed the whole affair as one that has got out of proportion and a diversion from a packed agendaEven if the Conservative involvement in the US election campaign is pushed into the backgroundthere is plenty of scope on the agenda for disagreementnot least Northern IrelandClinton wooed the Irish vote in his campaign by promising to send a peace envoy to Northern Irelanda move regarded by Britain as an intrusion into a domestic issueSince the electionofficials on both sides of the Atlantic have toned this down to a special envoyone that would be on a fact-finding missionAlthough Britain still regards this as an embarrassmentit is putting a brave face on it by claiming that most Irish-Americans have a distortednationalistic view of the conflict and that such a mission might go part of the way to dispelling itOn his visit to Capitol HillMajor will meet Tom Foleythe House of Representatives' Speakeran Irish-American who has been mentioned as leading such a missionThe reaction from Ulster Unionists has been an almost automatic rejectionbut Downing Street has been keen to point out that Foley has been vocal in his criticism of the IRA and his appointment might not be such a bad moveIn the bigger worldthe GATT talks seem to have been going on foreverwith Downing Street promising for two years that the end was in sightThe fear must be that Clinton might unpick some of the dealssuch as the one on agriculturebut this was thought to be unlikelygiven his commitment to moving out of recessionOn the strategic frontthere has been no coherent approach since President Bush dubbed the post-Cold War position as the New World OrderIn factwestern policy has been notable for its lack of orderparticularly towards RussiaOn Bosniawhile Britain has welcomed US involvementit has had to keep itself from dismissing as laughable the feasibility of proposed US airdropsThe special relationshiphas long been a mythone which the UK has more of an interest in perpetuating than the USwhere the reality is that Britain is regarded as a second-rank nationMajor may have made it to the White House before Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrandbut that does not mean he is regarded as being more important than either of themTalk of a special relationshipis a

hurricanes decide to renew my acquaintance and pea-soupers that would have done Victorian London proud descend on the mountainThis was Aonach MorScotland's otherwise impressive new skiing facility based just north of Fort WilliamThe weather was ghastlyThe skiing conditions little betterwith snow as soft as sandBut through the murk there was a faint glimmer of lightThroughout the day those working the lifts and keeping an eye on skiers actually wait for it smiledThey helped load skis into gondolasThey made sure children got safely on to the chairlift and picked them up and dusted them down if they fellThey produced rather more appetising food than the normal congealed heap of pie and beans and dead sausage rolls which it is mandatory to decline at other resortsThey evenpraise beasked skiers at the end of the day whether they had enjoyed the experiencehopefully so that they could take positive action if they had any complaints or worthwhile suggestionsCould this at last be a Scottish leisure facility which was trying to put customer care into practiceNot being a frequent visitor to the area I have no way of knowing whether this was a freak occurrenceI hope notbecause it actually felt as if this new resort was intent on getting to know its customers and providing them with a level of service in tune with expectationsIt doesn't happen oftenGiven the sorry demise of Scotland's manufacturing basewe are allif the good Baroness Thatcher's doctrine is believedsupposed to be imbued with a service culture which recognises the value of the customer and produces the kind of quality response requiredButto quote one of Maggie's very own good and faithful servantsBunkum and BalderdashWe know the jargonWe spout quality verbiageCorporate luminaries cackle on about the importance of qualityyet all too often use this management-babble as a substitute for effective leadershipWe pin up quality ditties on corporate walls to enthuse staff of our good and noble intentionsWe claim to produce quality thisserve quality thatWe witter on about quality initiatives and produce myriads of little forms to show just how quality-driven we areBut how many have actually analysed just what quality isHow many truly realise that quality is knowing your buyergetting him or her to define qualityrather than producing some sort of static standard which demands slavish conformanceAndmore to the pointhow many organisations have managed to convert their good qualityintentions into effective staff training which ensures that customers are treated with respectThe sad fact is that many organisations would be unable to recognise a customer even if he or she fell in front of themAccording to a recent report from the market research company Mintelcustomer perceptions of quality in products and service have more to do with their expectation that companies should get it right first time than with the belief that they should provide a safety net to protect consumers once things have gone wrongConsumerssays Mintelregard quality as the totality of attributes of the product or service which combines to meet their needs and expectationsAndwhen it comes to servicesconsumers are quite unanimous that quality is mostly down to the staff and how they behave with customersConsumers do not confuse the availability of good physical facilities with good qualitysuch facilities may tempt a consumer to choose a particular shopbut it is the quality of the staff which will determine whether the consumer will buy or return a second timeButif the truth be toldalthough we would like companies to get it right first timeour experiences have led us to expect rather lessWe don't believe that British goods will be as good as foreign importsWe allow ourselves

what remains of the Scottish coal industry now has a more secure futureSomebody had to take a standWe were expected to put our hands in our pockets and shell out regardless of whether or not we were

sites I was unusual and it was pretty well guaranteed to stop operations in their tracksGoing first meant that Buckley did not have any role models or even mentorsI just look at whoever is in the job aheadIt is a question of whether they are good at managingIf they are you use them as a role modelShe knows that by virtue of her position many women see her as a role model and so is happy to give advice when asked for itAny problems she has encountered have not been because of her genderbut because she has had older people working for herWhat happens when women engineers come through may be a different matterThey are dealing with power station staff and other engineers who don't make any allowances for youIf you get sat on it is because you allow yourself to be sat onIt is not because you are femaleIn any case she thinks it is just a matter of time before more women start coming through to senior levelsboth because the company is taking on more female graduates and because they are a pretty self-confident lot anywayOne of the women who works for me is one of the toughest women I have ever come acrossand most of the women graduates are more than competentThere are a lot of good young women coming upWHERE difficulties can occur is in the matter of familiesBuckleywho is unmarriedadmits that being successful in business is easier for a woman who has no childrenIt is still assumed that it is the woman who will give up work to look after the children or take time off if they are sickshe admitsIf you are going to be in senior job you are going to put a lot of time in so you give up your social life a bit perhapsYou feel pressure not to be seen to fail in the jobYou have got to show you are at least as good and a little bit extra to cover your backLike many women who have crashed through the glass ceiling orperhapsignored it she is strongly opposed to positive discrimination in favour of women and has little time for the argument that women don't succeed because they are womenIt is almost certainly the case you have to do a little bit extra because you are female but you don't have to prove you are twice as goodBut how will we know when the glass ceiling has goneI suppose equality will come when you no longer notice whether it is a man or a woman across the tableBuyer of all she surveysGrace Buckley finds coal comfortNo skirting the issue of inequality on highWhy is the fairer sex so unfairly represented in the top echelonsPETER WOODIFIELD reports on the assault on the invisible barriers and speaks to one woman who has bypassed themCHANGING attitudes to women in business is like changing course in a giant tankerEverything happens slowly but eventually change becomes apparent as more business leaders realise the nonsense of wasting the talents of a large chunk of their workforceThe problem has been particularly acute in the top echelons where the blue and grey suits are rarely disturbed by a skirtJust 0.5 per cent of Britain's company directors are womenIn 1991 the Government launched Opportunity 2000 in an attempt to encourage industry and commerce to take the issue seriously and the past two years have seen two of Britain's top 15 companies BTR and Sainsbury appoint female finance directorsBut the focus on women at the top has tended to focus on entrepreneurs such as Anita Roddick and Scotland's Pat Grant and Ann GloagAt least that way there is no way you can be held back by the so-called glass ceilingthe phrase coined in the United States to describe the invisible barriers that allow women to rise only so far in an organisationOn 9 March the Scottish division of the Institute of Directorswith Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise and supported by The Scotsmanis holding a seminar in Edinburgh to discuss the issuecovering not just the boardroom but also senior levels of managementThe IoD's Scottish membership68 women of 1,640 membersunderlines the pointDonald Hardiethe Scottish director of the IoDfeels the problem stems from the education systemwith girls being discouraged from studying the subjects that would get them on to the business ladderThe problem is that they are not there to be promotedThat is by and large truebut Hardie is not certain that men have taken it on board and he is keen for plenty of men to attend to get a better understanding of the positionBut while there may a shortage of suitable female candidatesit also becoming clear that there are women who have made it precisely because they refuse to be deflected from their chosen careerIndeedone of the speakers at the IoD seminar is Lesley Balethe managing director of Aberdeen Airport at the tender age of 33For her and others like her it is a question of wanting it sufficientlybeing prepared to put in the work and not expecting concessions because they are womenThe glass ceiling does not exist because they don't let itBut not all women are like thatToo many allow themselves to be steered into what are seen as traditionally female jobsor suffer discrimination if and when they have childrenWomen also tend to have a differentmore consensual style of managementand often dislike playing by the corporate rules that are invariably laid down by menDouglas Kinnairdof PA Consultants and one of the UK's top headhuntersmakes the point that quite often women don't realise how hard promotion is to get and that men have worked for it for monthsif not yearsIf they want to get promoted they have got to fight tooth and nailThey have got to find out the rules and then fight by the rulesA failure to realise just how tough it is means such women are held back more by their own glass hat than any supposed glass ceilingOne reality that cannot be avoided in the whole discussion is childrenThere is still an unspoken assumption that it will be the women who make the sacrifices when it comes to childcare and it is perhaps the thickest glass ceiling of all for many womenGovernment statistics show that 74 per cent of women in managerial and administrative positions have no childrenand that is hardly likely to be a coincidenceAs it iswomen hold barely more than a quarter of all managerial and administrative postsyet make up nearly half the workforceIn the longer termthat particular barrier is likely to disappear through sheer economic necessity on the part of businessGraduate recruitment in many businesses and industries now tends to be evenly splitand companies will not be able to afford to lose a large chunk of talent in which so much money has been investedespecially as women in any case tend to be less tempted by the grass is greenersyndromeBut all that being saidthere is a real problem right nowKinnairdwho is chairing the seminarsays he is regularly asked to find a woman for a senior management job all other things being equalThe trouble is that things are not equaland he can hardly remember placing a woman in such a jobA headhunter for ten yearsKinnaird has just been commissioned by his first female clientwhich speaks volumesIt is hardly surprising that he cannot find the people he is looking for when even the largest organisations have so few senior womenThe Royal Bank of Scotland has a record in this field to be proud ofbeing a founder member of Opportunity 2000 and also one of just 150 companies entitled to call themselves Investors in PeopleIt has also just won its second national training awardNow 30 per cent of its junior management are womenalthough that figure falls away to a paltry 1 per cent at the highest levelsThe Royal has committed itself to increase that significantly in the next few yearsDr Mike Mossondirector personnel at the Royal Banksays the bank has a policy of positive assistanceand positive encouragementtowards womenalthough he insists that it falls short of positive discriminationFor some time it has had career breaks to help women and occasionally menwith family needs and he says it has been successfulBut while corporately the bank has adopted a positive approachMosson admits this is not always reflected in individual behaviourHe admits to being surprised at the split attitudes of middle-aged men and even some of the younger ones who want their daughters to have a proper career structure but then fail to apply that belief at workWe are winning in the sense we are finding it easier for women to make progress in the organisation and they are not the exception any moreI don't think we are moving fast enoughbut being realistic we are winningMost organisations are not so far advancedPerhaps more typical is Scottish & Newcastlewhich has a high proportion of female workersHenry Fairweathergroup personnel and services directoracknowledges that most of its female managers are in areas one might expect such as marketinginformation services and personnelWe have some in more traditional areas such as production but not as senior as we would likeS&N's executive committee has recently approved an initiative to find out what the situation is and is preparing an attitude survey to identify what managers are really thinking and what the problems are perceived to beAt the momentless than 10 per cent of S&N's senior managers are womenbut none of them are directors of any of the subsidiarieslet alone of the main boardLike the Royal Bank it is not setting specific targetsAt the end of the day it comes down to individual decisions about individual jobssays FairweatherWhat we have to do is create a culture in which appointing women to senior jobs is easierhe saysThat may not be as difficult

drove the amount to $935 million Â£635 millionBut AMR's balance sheet is strongits fleet young and passenger traffic has been climbing in recent monthsSowhen the company hosted 70 reporters for an annual review of business last weekfew expected chief executive Robert Crandall to say the sky was fallingBut he didWe are not going to be in business long termMr Crandall said at a dinner with the reportersAt the labour costs we incur todaywe cannot be in business long termHe was not predicting the end of Americanthe nation's largest airlinebut Mr Crandall said changing economics may eventually force AMR to sell parts of American to people who can make it profitableSimilarly gloomy comments by another AMR executive in a recent Wall Street Journal article prompted hundreds of travellers to call American about the soundness of their ticketsSome worried employees even called news organisations in Dallas and Fort Worth to find out what was happening at the companyThe comments come as American negotiates a new contract with the union representing its 21,600 flight attendantsBut Mr Crandall said the company will not seek concessions because that would hurt employee moralewhich he said must be maintained in a service businessFor monthsAmerican executives have been reviewing all aspects of the airline for cost savingsThe airline cut 600 managerial jobs in DecemberAmerican will not renew any expiring leases on Boeing 727sa move that could affect as many as 65 short-haul jetsAnd executives say they will decide by the end of March whether to ground up to 25 DC-10s or stop leasing a similar number of Airbus A300sRemoving the wide-body aircraft will force American to cut some routes and possibly some hubs by summerreversing nearly a decade of growthA delegation of North Carolina political and business officialsled by Governor Jim Huntwill visit Mr Crandall later this week to offer the airline a $620,000 Â£42,000incentive package to keep open its hub in Raleigh-DurhamI am not sure there is anything a state can do to change the economics of the airline businessMr Crandall saidPAMr Crandall has repeatedly blamed competitors operating in bankruptcy for

the sister citiesand omitted a line from a prepared statement that had said Tokyo and New York are more alike than any two cities on the face of the earthMr Dinkins said he wished that we could do as

reformminus the Russian example of shock therapyALEXANDER TKACHENKO reportsTHE former Soviet republic of Belarus is hedging its bets on economic reform with a mixture of market moves and old-style

serious crimesRapidly escalating violent crime figures are an indictment of British societyThey are also a reflection on those who administer justicein our courts and on the legislation that gives guidelines with regard to punishment for various crimesWithout questionmany judges and sheriffs are far too lenient in sentencing people found guilty of violent crimesThe soft option of imprisonment is not the answerMillions of British people support a call for the death penalty for a wide range of offences whichin my opinionshould include the followingMurderattempted murderculpable homiciderapechild abusepossession of a deadly weapon with intent to use itassault which results in permanent serious injury to body or mindkidnappingacts of terrorism and drugs' traffickingWe have reached the stage where no-one is safe to walk our streets at any time of day or nightThis is an intolerable situation and society has to remove those who will not conform to reasonable standards of behaviourThe argument that a small number of innocent people may be wrongly executed is far outweighed by the fact that thousands of innocent people are dyingbeing permanently maimedor mentally

self-perpetuating oligarchyMay God forgive us our hypocrisyGlobal warmingIn describing a proposed combined heat and power schemeAuslan Cramb claims in a report today that carbon dioxide emissions contribute to the greenhouse effect as if this was something to be avoidedCarbon dioxide is certainly a greenhouse gasbut 99 per cent of the greenhouse effect without which life on Earth would not be possibleis due to water vapourThe remaining 1 per cent is due to methanenitrous oxideozoneCFCsandcarbon dioxidePerhaps Auslan Cramb meant to claim as he has done beforethat carbon dioxide emissions from combustion are causing global warming a slight increase in the greenhouse effect raising the temperature of the EarthHoweverit has not yet been established that global warming is due to excessive combustion of fossil fuelsIt might be a natural fluctuation in the Earth's temperatureor even the result of the growth of the human and animal populationConsequentlycarbon dioxide emissions are not necessarily something to be avoidedSkye bridge and islanders' rightsI was intrigued to note that Scottish Secretary Ian Langin his recent address to the Edinburgh University Politics Societyshould choose to cite the Skye bridge development as an example of the great success of this Government's non-interventionistapproach to the future provision of essential public amenitiesIt is not without considerable irony that he should choose an example which is so uniquely interventionist as to render his previous assertion almost meaninglessThis developmentcurrently under constructionis an example of this Government's total disregard for the process of democracy and its equal contempt for the attendant principle of genuine accountabilityFar from being non-interventionistin this case Mr Lang has not only acted as promoter of the scheme itselfbut also as overseer of the setting up of the public inquiryIts reporter's attempts to implement even the most modest of safeguards for the people affected by the proposalswere simply dismissed by the Scottish Secretarythis time wearing the non-interventionisthat of adjudicator on the inquiry's finding and recommendationsIndeedthe only non-interventionist element in all these proceedings has been the Scottish Secretary's refusal to intervene to protect the rights of the people of these communities who must have the rightif it is their wishto have a bridge built as an integral part in the overall development of an infrastructure serving the needs of the areaThis basic right has been denied to the people in a high-handed and cynical fashionInsteadthey are to be shackled indefinitely to the burden of paying high toll charges which would not be tolerated in any other part of the countryThis is not simply for the purpose of recouping capital costsbut more importantly for the purpose of generating huge profits for the private sector developersThe Scottish Secretary has chosen to pursue this non-interventionistpolicy in the face of criticismnot only from the local communitiesbut from the National Trust for Scotlandthe Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland and the many other professional commentators who have expressed their opposition on a variety of groundsHe has permitted this developmentwhich if not in actual breach of European environmental lawis certainly at odds with its spiritHe is supporting a scheme that is essentially a monopoly and does not allow for any genuine competitive challenge whichas we have all been informedis the only real moderating influence on the free market provisionThe actions of the Government in this matter have been quite remarkablenot least in the degree of arrogance on displaybut more distressingly as a result of a public rendered powerless by a Scottish Office

citizensgoing to the disco becomes a risky venturehouseholders in urban centres suffer disturbances as pubs and clubs with late licences disgorge their clientscar owners fight a daily battle against thievesThere is an element of despair in the public's reaction to the apparent spread of the diseasethough the current political and moral debate about crime in general may hold out hope of an antidoteMore police officers visibly going about their business is the most commonly advanced solution to street crimeBut even if that were the case and the experience of the past 12 yearswith an increase in police strength being matched by an increase in reported crimecasts some doubt on it the authorities could not afford to apply it because of their limited resourcesThey areinsteadusing other strategiesIn Scotland these include a special campaign to make the carrying of knives an offencethe use of bullet-proof video cameras as a method of town centre surveillanceandmost widely applied of alla curb on late-night licencesFor some tastes these measuresand particularly the lastmight seem to be simplistic responses to public outrage based on the old principle of having to be seen to be doing somethinganything in a crisisYet all the evidence is that most violent crimes occur between 11 pm and 3 am at the weekendwith the largest number happening on a SaturdayReducing drinking hoursthereforewould seem to be a sensible way of curbing some of the worst examples of drunken violenceThe installation of surveillance cameras also seems to workif Airdrie's experience is anything to go byTruethis remedy contains more than an element of big brotherand it may be that it does no more than turn the criminals away from the areas covered by the cameras' eyesNevertheless it is clearly playing a useful part in a prevention campaignindeedthe greater the number of elements in such a strategy the betterSuch measures may not tackle the root causesbut they may help everyone to

degradationas witnessed daily by thousandsTwisted trails of blameDavid Ott examines the UN's tortuous route to secure the prosecution of those committing atrocities in war-torn BosniaADVOCATES of the rule of law in international affairs must welcome the decision of the UN Security Council to consider establishing a war crimes tribunal in the former YugoslaviaBut if this is to prove more than gesture politicsa number of challenges must be facedSome of these are obviousHow will prospective defendants be caughtWill people be prosecuted when their co-operation is needed to implement an eventual peace agreementOn the other handcan peace really be allowed to depend on the goodwill of people who have already shown their contempt for even basic considerations of humanityAnd what chance will peace have if the enraged victims see the criminals escaping scot-free with the spoils of their crimesNone of these problems should be minimisedBut even if they are overcomeother more fundamental difficulties will remainThe first of these is crucialwill the prosecution and punishment of Yugoslav war criminals be fairPredictablythe leader of the Bosnian SerbsDr Radovan Karadzichas already cried foul on the ground that war crimes in other parts of the world go unpunishedThough not without meritthis argument is weaker here than it might be elsewheresince the UN plan appears designed to punish all war criminals in the former Yugoslavia rather than to impose international law on one party onlyIt will not be a case of victor's justiceBut problems remain in connection with the scope of the tribunal's remitThe UN Security Council resolution 808 concentrates on violations of international humanitarian lawThat is much narrower than the jurisdiction given to the Nuremberg tribunal after the Second World Warwhich was allowed also to consider crimes against peace and crimes against humanity such as planning and waging of aggressive war and genocideIf the Security Council excludes from the new tribunal's jurisdiction such larger crimeswhich are perhaps more likely to be committed by higher state officialsthe resulting trials may end up dealing only with the small fry while the big fish get awayThis in turn impinges on the problem of deterrentsa point which the French authors of resolution 808 were keen to emphasiseA war crimes prosecution in which high-ranking commanders and political leaders were likely to escape justice would hardly deter people in such positions from continuing their outrages and it could encourage them to press their sometimes morally debased followers to obey orders regardless of their illegalityThe plan's success as a deterrent depends as well on how vigorously the UN will back it up with actionThe UN must now put its money where its mouth isOtherwiseraising the issue in the first place could in the end prove counter-productiveif an international war crimes tribunal is clearly revealed to have no teethpotential offenders may be emboldened to do whatever they likePunishment of convicted war criminals is also problematicThe Security Council has wisely ruled out the death penaltyhowever much it might seem justified as retributionThis leaves the problem of where and under what conditions prisoners would serve their sentencesWould those convicted have to be held in the national prisons of UN membersThis could expose willing states to charges of being unduly harsh or lenient in their treatment of prisoners and open to acts of reprisal or terrorism from sympathisers of those imprisonedSOME of these difficulties might be avoided if the United Nations would broaden its approach to consider the possibility of punishing what are now called international crimesA relatively new concept in international lawthis involves the guilt not merely of the rulers and agents of a state but of the state itselfAlthough proposed by the UN's International Law Commissionthe idea has been widely criticised as legally unsound and practically unworkableBut it does have the advantage of operating on a level where guilt or innocence might be easier to establish and where punishment could be imposed on a state basisThus if Serbia were convicted of aggression or ethnic cleansingits punishment might include enforced disarmamentthe disgorging of illegally-seized territorythe payment of reparationsand the application of self-determination within its own bordersThis would seem to be a more constructive approach than simply locking up individualsIt would also deal with the danger posed by ardent nationalists or super-patriots who might willingly run the risk of themselves being prosecuted for war crimes if they thought their state would gain some permanent benefit from their actionsIf these problems can be overcome by the planners who are now setting to work under the direction of the UN Secretary-Generalthe Yugoslav war crimes tribunal could be an important step in strengthening international lawRole models as safe as housesDid history really end when the Wall came downA leading French economist believes that the defeat of communism has merely presented capitalism with a new

coherentThere is a strand of social theory which says that society is defined by its transgressorsthat we know the civilised values that bind us together only through their breachwhich we call crimeSomething of the same analysis can be applied to capitalismWas it ever anything more homogeneous than the sum total of the systems which were not communismThat might seem to be precisely the sort of querulous argument which the Left has familiarly been scorned for posingBut it is also increasingly explored by the Rightconcerned to explain the electoral disillusionment which drove Bush out of

is the increasing divergence between them andfor a FrenchmanFrance's continued indecision about which system to pursueFor British readersthe first model which has been in the politicalif not the

buckmarketsincluding foreign exchangeleft unfettered to bestow their dynamism on the economya state rolled as far back as is electorally tenableand a participatory capitalismbased on profit rather than ownershipwhere almost anything is a commodity to be tradedThe Rhine modelby contrastvalues bankers more than brokersIt sees far fewer categories of goods or services as being susceptible to tradeand in particular sees companies as communities rather than commodities basing wages on structured scales rather than market rates or productivity achievementsIt places high worth on loyalties

the two models of capitalism diverge on the fundamental question of whether to live for the present moment and to hell with the consequences for future generations or to plan for a better tomorrowthough it may require sacrifices todayThis dilemma lies at the heart of the ethical choices facing every society as the 20th century draws to a closeThe crucible of these choices is corporate financeIt is a familiaryet penetratingcriticism of free market economies that the imperatives companies face to satisfy the adolescent greed of the financial markets and the escalating expectations of shareholders or else prepare for predators has diminished the scope of strategic planning to buffing up the next set of interimsThe consequenceat worstis a neglect of research and developmentstrategic investment and skills trainingBy contrastin the well-managed consensusof the Rhine modelbanks rather than stock markets are the guardians of the capitalist flameAlbert saysFrankfurt's total capitalisation is only a third of the London stock exchange and a ninth of Wall Streetwith many of the biggest German companies lacking even a listingCompany finance is the province of the banksgenerating the close and patient relationships that power the German economyThe banks are benignstable shareholdersMost German manufacturers have their house bankoften a major shareholder and locked into an enduring relationshipBy the same tokenbig manufacturers are often shareholders in their chosen bankThe drawbacks of this relationship are its stolid dullness and its tendency to focus

feetWOULD the last one outplease put off the lightsSome people may remember those words being splashed across the front page of the Sun on the eve of last April's general electionRupert Murdoch's mass circulation tabloid stooped to a new level of vicious scaremongering when it seemed that Neil Kinnock might just succeed in leading Labour back into governmentTodayhoweverthe Sun must be wishing that it had held that headline in reserveFor it neatly encapsulates the state of public morale in Britain less than a year into the fourth consecutive Conservative termIn an opinion poll published this week49 per cent of the British public said that they would emigrate if they couldThere has never been such a vote of no confidence in the country since Gallup began measuring the urge to emigrate in 1948Rival pollsters have argued that this finding should be handled with some cautionThey point out that disenchantment has been swollen no doubt by recent events such as the surge in unemployment past the three million markthe murder of two-year-old James Bulger in Liverpool and even the February weatherBut no-one has dismissed it as a rogue pollOther polling organisations have also detected a

Worcesterchairman of the polling organisation MoriOver the last several decadesthere has been a declineno question about itin the confidence people have in British institutionshe reportsThere is a declining belief in monarchyin Westminster and Whitehallin the judiciary and in the system of government as a wholeHenry Porter doubtless spoke for many when he wrote recently in the GuardianLittle in the post-war years of decline in Britain has prepared us for the deep sense of unease now being experienced by its peopleSuddenly what seems to be at stake is not economic and material wellbeingbut the Britishness of being BritainWe have begun to lose our confidence in our institutionsthe traditions and bodies that constitute a very large part of the national culture especially in the monarchy which a year ago appeared to be one of the unassailable certainties of British lifeHow can our fragmented society make itself whole againHow can a culture permeated by possessive individualism restore the fraying bonds of communityThese questions are being asked now not just by political theoristsalthough some of them are giving the most considered answersDavid Marquandone of Britain's most acute political analystshas written that only a notion of communityof fraternitycan make it a duty as opposed to a compassionate whim to help one's fellowsIn his bookThe Unprincipled SocietyMarquand deplored the conception of power and authority that has underpinned Britain's political order since the 18th centuryHe argued that our existing governmental arrangements are inimical to forging a sense of fraternityTalk of a new constitution may still be restricted largely to the so-called chattering classesbut the general public seems to have roused from what George Orwell called the deepdeep sleep of EnglandIn Homage to CataloniaOrwell wrote despairingly of the fundamental contentment of those who sleep deeply in the belief that the fundamentals are secureHe was referring to that curious mixture of kingslords and commons which have been the essential elements of Britain's unwritten and until now unchallenged constitutionRepublicanism may not be rampant yetbut the Duchess of York's indiscretions and the Prince and Princess of Wales's separation have certainly made it more respectableEven prominent members of the Labour Party traditionally timid on this front have started to argue openly that the Royal Family's role must be streamlined and modernised if it is to survive for very much longerPerhaps the nation's mood would be cheerier if we simply had someone else in charge

little drama and other scenes like it is played out method-acting style almost every day in this particular householdYesit's homework timeBut the children here go to a school where a steady and regular dose of homework is the normAt other schools and in other householdsit's differentMany primary age kids are recommended by their schools to take a break from the first three R's and take up another one relaxingGiven that the homework routine of different schools varieswhat can the anxious parent do to make sure that their child is getting enoughand what do they need to know about itif anythingIs the link between home and school strong enough and at what point do you interveneAnd can a parent become involved if they are dissatisfied with the homework programme of the schoolAt secondary school the allocation of homework is usually uniformThere are essays to be donemaths questions to answer and a still life to be drawn at almost every school across the countryBut there is no routine at primary schoolSometimes one school will have a set policy and even a policy statement on homework while another will leave it to the individual whim of the teacherJohn McCabejunior school headmaster at St Aloysius CollegeGlasgowan independent schoolsays that homework is an integral part of what the school doesIt reinforces and give practice to what has been going on during the dayhe saysPrimary 4 and 5 are given an average of 60 minutes conscious homework each eveningIn primary 6 and 7 that goes up to one hour l5 minutesChildren at St Aloysius College are given a home work diary which their parents must sign every dayThe diary tells the children and parents what is required to be done on any one eveningMr McCabe saysThe advice to parents is if a lower school child is struggling after 45 minutesthen don't let them continueThe teacher will look at the problem the next morningThe school believes their homework scheme is very successfulThey say that parents who pay for their children's education expect them to be given homeworkIt means children acquire a serious attitude to their school work and it's a good habitsays Mr McCabeIt makes them more responsible for their own work and gets them into the idea that they have to work outside normal school hoursThey acquire the habit of studying and that is worthwhileHoweverthis very stringent pattern of homework is not one that many other state schools with primary age children adhere toAt a non-denominational school in the west end of Glasgow a head teacher explained that the maximum time to be spent on homework was half an hourWe are of the opinion that if a child is working hard in school they really should be relaxing and doing other things out of itshe saidBut what if the parent is not happy with this and believes that their child really ought to be doing more homeworkIt is the school policyParents looking for advice on what to do to help with their child's education will be told that the most important thing is to spend quality time talking to their childrenthe West End headteacher saidShe advises worried parents to take their children out to museumsthe theatre and cinemaand to make sure that they are getting plenty of interaction with other childrenShe addsTalking to children is the biggest advantageAt Sciennes primary in Edinburghhead teacher Maureen Pollock tends to agreeShe says that her teachers are keen to make sure that all work should match individual children's needsParents are given a school bookletpart of which outlines the school's policy on homeworkA child's formal education stops at the end of each school day but education continues at all timesit saysIt is important that children have time to playpursue interests and hobbies and take part in informal organised activities with other children and aloneFor this reason we do not believe in formal homework on a regular basisAt Scienneshomework is phased in as children approach high school ageChildren from Primary 3 upwards do have diaries to keep parents informed if there has been any homework set but is rarely any until Primary 7 ageDifferent schools have different policies and different children have different homeworkWhat becomes clear is that a parent must listen to the individual school's advice on what they see as the best sort of homework to give and in what amountsHomework should not be used as a means of controlling children but as a key to the development to their educationAnd if a school feels that adding that fourth R to the old readingwritingarithmetic routine then it seems a parent

the problem the Government had to tackle the whole issue of deprivationAlison Hillhousedirector of ASH ScotlandsaidTime and time again you hear these women say their first priority is to feed their family and pay their billsThey don't have a lot left over for themselves and they see smoking as an affordable luxury which helps them copeHealth education programmes had to be targeted at poorer

a full night's sleep still exhaustedDo you often feel like dozing off during the day when you need to be awakeThe need for sleep varies from person to person some require more than the average eight hours sleep a night be perfectly normalHoweverwhen the need to sleep interferes with daytime activitiesthis is a problem known as hypersomniaHypersomnia has many causes and can vary in severity from slight drowsiness to falling sound asleepExternal factors include excessive heat or poor ventilationPsychological states such as boredom or depression can lead a person to escape into sleepPhysical illness can lead to extra sleepiness tooMany sleeping pillsantihistamines and other drugs leave the user drowsy during the dayso always check labels for warnings about this side-effectLifestyle is important irregular bedtime hours and spending too long in bed can contribute to over-sleepinessLounging in bed long after waking can leave you feeling only half-awake all dayDrinking alcohol during the daytime and over-eating can lead to an over-powering desire to nod off just think of the average household after Christmas dinnerShift work can cause problem sleepiness since changing rotas and night duties befuddle body clocksSleep taken during the day is less refreshing because body hormones triggered by daylightwhich aid activityare fighting against another type of hormone stimulated by

drowsinessThere are 1.5 million recorded sufferers in Britain and an estimated 2,500 sufferers in LothianThis condition is recognised by chronic snoring and choking during sleepThe good news is that not everyone who snores occasionally is a sleep apnoea sufferer and also the condition is curableIf in doubt consult your doctor who can refer you for specialist treatmentDr John Eaglesof the Ross

Februaryon behalf of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland gives a reasoned and balanced account of the present legal frameworkThis can enable those whobecause of mental illnessmay pose a significant risk to their own health or safety or the safety of other people and who are limited in self-awarenessto accept treatment or carewhether or not including medicationWhile the Mental Health ScotlandAct 1984 is undoubtedly superior to the English legislation in regard to the use of extensions of the leave of absence provisionsthis seems to me to be a less than satisfactory way of addressing the problem for a number of reasonsboth practical and philosophicalFurthermorethough the number of persons suffering from a mental disorder who cannot be helped on a voluntary basis is relatively smallthe number of such persons in the community is likely to increaseThis is because of the current emphasis on care in the community and the reduction in the number of bedsparticularly long-stay or continued care bedsin the psychiatric hospitalsIndeed the psychiatric hospitals themselves mayin many areascease to existFrom the practical point of viewthe use of the leave of absence provisions can cause problems in keeping track of the renewal documentationparticularly if a doctor has a number of patients on leave of absenceIt can cause problems if patients' case records are held at the place from which they went on leave of absencebut they are being seen for review elsewhere or are attending some other facility such as an out-patient clinic or a day hospitalIt can complicate the management of in-patients beds if beds have to be kept available to accommodate persons on leave of absence who may relapse and require urgent readmission and it can distort the patient statisticsDespite the fact that current legislation does make some attempt to provide a legal framework governing the treatment of the mentally illits central focus remains that of detentionIs it not time to look afresh at the foundations of our laws in relation to mental illness with a view to making the central focus that of providing a framework whereby those whose judgment is so impaired by their illness that they are unable to recognise the need for treatment will receive such treatment in as humanesensitive and effective a way as possibleThis would be irrespective of whether that treatment involves hospitalisation or notI refer to a legal framework that protects without stigmatisingwhich recognises and takes account of the needs of society in generalthe needs of the families and carersand the needs of the individual and which provides as equitable a balance as possible between the individual's rights of autonomy and liberty and the right to have access to the best possible treatmentrehabilitation and careThis would be with the minimum of bureaucracy and social alienationSecurity checkYou published last week an account of our ordeal at the hands of burglars who

not possible to acknowledge them individuallyWe would like to thank all those well-wishers most warmly for their supportHomelessnessGlasgow University's recently published study of homelessness among the young in Scotland simply highlights the facts which have been known to anyone who had been working in the social security system in whatever capacity for a number of yearsThe changes which came into place in April 1988 have had a devastating effect on young peopleAt the stroke of a pen they removed hundreds of thousands of needy youngsters from the benefit system and condemned many of them to a life of mendicant povertymany also slipped into prostitutionIn desperationin many casesyoung females deliberately become pregnant because they know that once they are in that state they are immediately restored to the benefit systemMoreoverthere is at least a possibility that local authorities will house them and their rent will be paid under housing costsHoweverthere is a snageven in this desperate solutionin that the changes also withdrew the facility which was available under supplementary benefit to make single payments for furniture etcPrior to 10 April1988a young person in this situation could apply to the Department of Health and Social Securityas it then wasfor a single payment grant for essential items of furnitureThe apparatus put in its placeof social fund grants and social fund loansis widely and almost totally discreditedI do not suggest that to restore benefit to 16 to 18-year-olds would solve this problem overnightbut it would go far down the road to alleviating this problem which surely must be unacceptable in 1993The UN was designed to oversee global peace and securitybut how can it fulfill this primary task in the violent post-Cold War eraasks Paul WilkinsonNations must unite to close credibility gapHOPES that the ending of the Cold War would lead to a new era of peace have been rudely dashedNo-one should underestimate the enormous gain in freedom for millions who had been trapped in the oppression of communist dictatorshipsbut the speed with which the liberation of eastern Europe occurred was so stunning that it raised what we can now

rebellionIn SomaliaSudanEthiopia and many other poverty-stricken countriesthe brutal violence of local warlords combined with the effects of droughthave brought death by starvation to hundreds of

desperately needed aid supplies into Bosniahis first major foreign policy decisionshows that America still has an outward-lookingfundamentally internationalistleadershipBut there are strict limits to what even American resources can achieveUS citizens want their government to solve their huge domestic economic problemsThere is also an abiding reluctance to see America getting drawn in to another Vietnama bitter and protracted war exacting a huge price in US lives and treasureWe should not underestimate the courage it must have taken for Clinton to give the go ahead to the Bosnian airliftIN the longer termthe only real hope of establishing an effective system of global peace and security is the UNThis is the primary task for which it was originally designedFor nearly 45 yearsit was unable to function properly because it became a political battleground in the Cold WarTime and again action by the Security Council was blocked by the veto power of the Soviet Union and other permanent membersYet the UN ideals embodied in the Charter still retained respect and moral authority because most people knew it was not the UN's fault that the Security Council was paralysedAndin spite of its huge handicapsthe UN was able to improvise some extremely successful peace-keeping operationsfor example in the Middle Eastand to show its effectiveness in social and economic development through the work of agencies such as the World Health Organisation WHOand the Food and Agriculture Organisation FAONow this has all changedQuite suddenly the UN has moved to the centre stage of world politicsWith the ending of the Cold WarRussia showed its willingness to co-operate with other permanent members on major issues of peace and securityThis was vividly demonstrated when the UN took steps to oppose Iraq's aggression against KuwaitThe coalition against Saddam was able to operate under the aegis of the UN with the full authority of Security Council resolutions behind itThis was a great boost to UN authoritybut of course it has alsoThis has raised expectations of similar operations to deal with major challenges to peace and massive violations of human rights elsewhereBut the harsh fact is that the UN was able to operate effectively in liberating Kuwait because it suited US national interests to undertake this taskand America and its allies clearly preferred to operate with the Security Council's approvalLacking any military forces of its ownthe UN is pathetically dependent on the goodwill of its most powerful membersThis carries two great dangersIt risks damaging the UN's moral authority and reputation for impartiality if it is seen as the vehicle of superpower foreign policyit causes huge embarrassment to the UN whenbecause of its own prioritiesthe US is unable to helpand the UN is then confronted with the question why have you failed to act decisively in our crisis while you were willing to do so in the case of Iraq's aggressionAnother important aspect of the changing role of the Security Council is its new attitude to the principle of absolute sovereignty of member states over their internal affairsIn the bold decision to set up the Kurdish safe-havens and the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq after the Gulf warand the decision to intervene militarily in Somaliawe see a significant departure from the principle of absolute sovereignty over domestic mattersPeace-keeping operations have also significantly changed in emphasisThe demand for the UN's peace-keeping services has risen alarminglyoverstretching the organisation's near bankrupt resourcesSince 1988the UN has been called upon to mount 13 peace-keeping operationsas many as in the entire 23 years up to 1987Many of these new operationssuch as United Nations Transition Assistance Group UNTAGin Namibia have performed a whole range of difficult civilian tasks in addition to the military aspects of peace-keepingFor examplein NamibiaUNTAG not only had to ensure that the ceasefire was observedit also went on to tackle a programme of repatriationand oversee the first elections for the new stateIt was a hugethough little known success for the UN and the people of NamibiaNinety-seven per cent of those qualified to vote did so and a new democratic constitution was adopted by unanimous voteThe role of civilian expertsranging from police to specialists in elections and administrationhas become a crucial part of the UN peace-keeping packageDespite such successes in imaginative shoestring operationsthe UN is desperately in need of reform and strengthening if it is to meet the critical tests of the post-Cold War eraThe great merit of the UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's Agenda for Peace report to the Security Council summit last year is its tough-minded and realistic assessment of the kind of reforms so urgently requiredThe huge gap between the UN's resources and capabilities on the one hand and the expectations of UN help in every crisis around the world is highlighted by the organisation's financial crisisBy May 1992member states owed the UN a total of more than Â£1 billion towards the cost of its peace-keeping and regular budgetsAGENDA for Peace estimates the current annual cost of UN peace-keeping at nearly $3 billionYetas the report points outglobal defence expenditures of the member states are estimated to total almost $1 trillion per yearThe report makes the excellent proposals that member states should plan to finance their peace-keeping contributions from defencerather than foreign affairsbudgetsThis makes excellent sense when one recognises that the UN's operations are actually helping to save further defence costs by preventing escalation into wider wars and by providing a form of collective burden sharing for peace-keeping purposesThe report also calls for new reserve funds for UN peace-keeping to be urgently establishedOne of Boutros-Ghali's most important proposals is for a strengthening of preventive diplomacyparticularly through the Chapter VI peaceful dispute revolution mechanisms of the CharterIf greater efforts were put in at this level at an early stagethrough early warning on emerging conflictsmany major wars could be preventedBut Boutros-Ghali is no woolly-minded liberalHe fully realises that there are situations when the world organisation must be able to use military forceHe wants the preventive deployment of UN peace-keeping forces in order to prevent hostilities breaking outas is now being attempted in MacedoniaThe report also emphasises the need for the UN to face up to the responsibilities of peace enforcement when peaceful diplomacyeconomic sanctions and all other measures have failedCurrentlythe UN as such has no way of implementing its enforcement powers under Chapter VIIIt depends entirely on the goodwill of America and other richer member states to take this on an improvised basisThe Secretary General recommends that earmarked forces should be provided for the UN to give it a permanent rapid deployment force with all the requisite logistic and technical support and air and sea lift capabilitiesFormer President Bush indicated America's readiness to offer US military liftlogisticscommunications and intelligence capabilities to support peace-keeping operationsThis was a generous offer and the Secretary General is alreadyin the case of the Bosnian airlift planshowing how dependent the UN continues to be on the generosity of Uncle SamBut is this really fair or desirableIs it not time that we took the Agenda for Peace seriously and gave the UN the resources it needs to save this and future generations from the scourge of warBoutros-Ghali's proposals are directed as much to the citizens of member states as to their governmentsIf our peace-loving citizens really care about the future of our world organisationthey must help to create the momentum for reform by mandating our politicians to adoptat least as a beginningthe urgently-needed measures recommended by the Secretary GeneralFeel the forcepeace-keeping operations have changed in emphasis and demand for the UN's services has risen

peace-keeping forces in order to prevent hostilities breaking outas is now being attempted in MacedoniaA criminal tendency to apportion blameIncreasing violence has led society to root out scapegoatsbut new research in Scotland suggests that those fingered don't fit in the framesays Mike WilsonMORAL panic is one of the more enduring items on the domestic cultural menu and in a month of fatal stabbingshorrific child murder and economic gloomsociety seems once again all too willing to frighten itself to deathAnd to root out scapegoatsThis week's focus is on juvenile delinquentsBut not far behind in the firing line are welfare-dependent single-parent familiesnow so used to being vilified it seems time to offer a blindfold and last cigaretteIt is theysay criticswho most accurately reflect the health of the welfare state in the late 20th centuryan underclass of the dependentthe criminal and the morally degenerateBut according to research released yesterdaythe facts don't quite fit the scriptChildren of welfare-dependent single-parent families have neither a monopoly on juvenile crime nor a disdain for conventional valuesIt seems the only thing which divides the underclass from the rest of society is cashThe findingswhich will appear later this year as a chapter of a bookare those of Edinburgh University's Richard KinseyWhat they amount to is an appeal for calmHis apparent heresy is not that of the smooth talking clericbut the statistician specialising in the field of criminologyCrimeDeprivation and the Scottish Urban Environment is a simple exercise in gathering factsa mapping the contours of crime in Scotlandsays KinseyBut in a debate often skewed by anecdote and rhetoricits steady empirical analysis makes it one of the most significant critiques of the underclass to emergeKinsey defines the underclass by turning to a bibliography spanning Social Darwinism to Monday's Daily Mailvia Sir Keith Joseph and the US political scientist Charles Murraypublished recently in the Sunday TimesBroadly speakingsays Kinseythese writers share the following claimsFirstlyfor a section of the population in practice the unemployed poor the availability of state benefits provides a basic financial guarantee allowing choices to be made and actions pursuedwhich previously were unavailable due to the constraints of the labour marketSecondlythe welfare state has unwittingly provided incentivesfor non-participation in workeducation and family lifeevidence of which is visible in the rejection of the work ethicthe relaxation of moral standards and the emergence of the dependency cultureAnd finallyevidence of the growing underclass is to be found in the increase in single-parent familiesthe increase in crimeand the lack of attachment to conventionalvaluesThese symptomsit is saidare most prevalent among young people living in poor areasTO test thisKinsey has analysed the results of one of the biggest surveys of its kind in Europeconsisting of carefully-monitored questions put to 3,500 young people from all walks of life in Edinburgh and the LothiansIf the underclass theorists have got it rightargues Kinseythen nowhere will it be more apparent than among the children of welfare-dependent single-mother familiesIt will be they who commit the most crimeit will be they who will stick two fingers up to conventional moresBut the underclass theorists seem to have got it wrongYoung people from welfare-dependent single-parent families just aren't artful dodgers ready to graduate into serious crime and a moral vacuumSurenearly 60 per cent of them admitted committing some sort of crime or incivility in the nine months prior to being questionedBut at 60 per cent offendingsuch children were being no more criminal and sometimes considerably less criminal than their more affluent peersSuch as latch-key kids from middle-class backgroundsIn contrastin single-parent families where the adult was workingthe offending rate shot to 74 per centIn two-parent familieswhere no adults were in workthe corresponding figure was 46 per centwhich rose to 55 per cent when one of the adults was in work and 59 per cent when both adults were in workOn the basis of these figuresthe issue of juvenile crime seems less to do with welfare dependencyand more to do with after-school child careWhere the findings are even more startling involves the social attitudes of young peopleFar from rejecting conventional values for example towards family relationshipsschool work and the environment underclass children expressed higher levels of concern than those from other backgroundsOf all the groups of young people questionedsays the findingsthe children of welfare-dependent single mothers consistently recorded the highest levels of anxiety about their prospects fortheir future 66 per centtheir school work 75 per centother members of their family 88 per centpersonal relationships with others 90 per centand even on green issues and the environment 74 per centSAYS KinseyWhat we have seen in newspaper editorials and in political speeches over a period of timeis a latching on to the problem of crime and a series of assertions about the so-called welfare-dependent underclassIn my viewthose arguments are based on very little researchhyperbole and appeal to the most crude stereotypesAnd they have become a Trojan Horse to undermine some very basic and strongly-held principles of welfare and the welfare stateHe is backed by Adrian Sinfieldprofessor of social policy at Edinburgh Universitywhose concern is that attacks on the welfare state are being carried out in a climate of increasing economic inequality and worsening povertyPoverty is increasing and it's being called dependencyOver the last decadebenefits for the unemployed have been cut in some 50 different ways so that the living standards of those out of work have fallen even further behind those of other citizensSince 1950 the number of those unemployed for more than a year has increased from 34,000 to more than a million at the start of this yearAccording to information just releasedonly a quarter of the unemployed are supported by a National Insurance benefitwhile two thirds are forced to rely on means-tested schemesIf there is to be a debate about welfare benefitsargues Sinfieldit must include the benefits accorded to the well-offsuch as mortgage reliefFor examplethe Â£10 billion of revenue lost in supporting occupational and personal pensions for the generally better-off must be set alongside the Â£6 billion spent on means-tested benefits for the poorest old peopleRichard Kinsey's final warning is that while it would be inappropriate to translate research conducted in Scotland to Englandvice versa you cannot generalise from the experience south of the Border to Scotland where we have a very different style of policinga very different system of juvenile justice and a very different welfare structureHISTORY is full of unexplained mysteriesfor which no current solutions have ever been foundSomeone reported a long time ago that an old ladyon her deathbedwas heard to sayWeelit will be a great blessing to

thatwhat are the facts behind the publication of the song The Road to the IslesOrstill in historywhat about the Douglas LarderWe all carry a few purely personal mysteriessome of which will never be solved in this lifebut may continue to gnaw for all our yearsMy great one isHow did Jim MacDougall dieThere is a lesser onewhich still remains an irritationIt occurs in a book called The Scots Week-endpublished by the Carswells in the late 1930sand crying out for some other publisher to take it up and put it on the marketwhere it would be grabbed by many eager ScotsCatherine and Donald Carswell were a husband and wife literary team who flourished at the same time as another pairWilla and Edwin MuirTheir book was published by Routledgeand a fine and stimulating rag-bag it iswith the best poems and songs and dance instructions and recipes and a whole round-up of the traditional wisdom of Scotlandif there be anyA section called An Examination Paper is where I met my downfallThey set a number of questions on many subjects whose answers are readily availablebut there is one above all which still scuppers meespecially as there are no solutions in the book nor in any subsequent editionThey mention the poem Lord Ullin's Daughterand the question they put isO who be ye would cross Loch GyleThis dark and stormy waterand then they go onDo you see anything in the boatman's question to suggest that he was the village idiotI don't get itCrackdown against nuisance tenantsCOUNCIL tenants in East Lothian were warned yesterday about terrifying their neighbours with anti-social behaviourThe district council housing committee signalled a crackdown on those who used and dealt in drugscaused nuisance and disturbance and threatened neighboursThe action proposed could throw families out in the streetThey would then be tagged as intentionally homelessThe hard line is part of a housing policy review on anti-social behaviour agreed by councillorsUnfortunately there are people with a total lack of respect for anyone or anything and the problem has grownCouncillor Tom Ferguson saidThere has always been a problemto a degreeof anti-social behaviourPeople are coming to us in great distressThey are being frightened to deathCouncillor Norman Murray said that the signal to unsocial tenants should be quite clear and had to be backed up with swift and firm actionA report to the committee from the director of housingBruce Walkersaid that complaints about bad neighbours in East Lothian had increased and become more seriousDrugs were playing a bigger and more worrying partCouncillors were told that a pilot scheme was to start in the Northfield-Coalgate area of Tranent in the spring with the support of Tranent Community Councilthe policeScottish Homes and the residents' associationIt would include a telephone helpline for bad neighbour complaintsIf it succeedssimilar schemes are likely across East LothianThe committee chairmanCouncillor Pat Fawcettsaid eviction would be the last resort as it showed failureIt was Macaulay who said that there was no more absurd and after the scenes in Liverpool I would say horrifyingspectacle than the English having one of their periodic fits of moralityHow salutarythereforeafter the hysteria of AA Miller's letter to findimmediately to handthe antidote of Nigel Bruce's down-to-earth common sensePerhaps it is not generally known that David Farrington's research on criminal careers suggests that the single most effective crime prevention policy is nursery educationwhich is denied to so many children in inner city areasWe also know that alcohol is the single most important cause of violencenot just directlybut also through the abuse committed on children by violently drunk parentsIt is time we actednot on the basis of hysteriabut on the basis of these and other related findingsAs the communal conscience is examinedin an avalanche of detailafter the death of little James Bulgerthere are certain aspects of contributory neglect which must be of great concern to everyoneFirst of all we must rid ourselves of the belief that punishment is wrong if it causes pain or inconvenience and does not have the full interest of the criminal at heartThe criminal rarely considers oursA surfeit of sympathy for the offender has brought this country to a level of tolerance which is an affront to the ordinary person's conception of justice and retributionWe must acknowledgeas we have done in the pastthe fact that a physically painful experience at an early agein the interests of disciplineis of more lasting value than a stream of compassionate understanding showered on a delinquent at a later stageOn this score there is much to deplore and despise in the activities of those who have systematically contributed to the breakdown of our society by embracing policies which have removedprogressivelythe props of discipline and authorityA catalogue of misconceived ideas has preceded our descent into chaosThey include the misguidedidealistic supporters of STOPPwho have eroded discipline in schools by describing a remedial stroke with a tawse or cane as a beatingor a thrashingThen there is the slack legislation passed by parliamentarians far removed from the sharp end of society and the liberal-minded intellectuals living in Cloud-cuckoo-landwhere tolerance for the assailant takes precedence over the suffering of the victimWe also have an over-compassionate bench and judiciary more concerned with the theory of justice than with its practical implementationMany parentsirrespective of classmust also stand condemned for similar dereliction of dutyThe fact that the average adult spends a minimum of 26 hours sitting in front of a television set in any one week represents not only time lost in sharing activities with their children and young peoplebut time lost in influencing and controlling themAiling economyWhile I am only too well aware of the ailing state of the UK economyI cannot help but agree with the comments made by both Scottish Liberal Democrat leaderJim Wallaceand SNP employment spokesmanRoger Mullinin response to yesterday's announcement of record Scottish unemployment figures of something in excess of 260,000In appropriately waterymetaphorsMr Wallace spoke of the Government's economic strategy in Scotland sinking beneath the wavesand Mr Mullin expressed concern that Scotland is being dragged down by the sinking ship of the UKIn response to R C Sneddon's letter todayI am afraid that I cannot offer any foolproof plan for economic recoveryHoweverI can agree with comments made by others that the way forward lies in a package of investment in small businesstraining and education to enable us to capitalise on the skills which existWe cannot simply allow ourselves to cash in on private sector industry at the expense of the many unemployed and low-paid whose living standards will inevitably decline as a result of the spiralling costs of wholesale privatisationFinallyat the risk of once more being accused of expressing my opinions in emotive termsI believe that we in Scotland must seekby whatever means possibleto establish a Scottish parliamentTV violenceI write on your article today on whether television affects children's behaviourIn July 1972 I spent a whole afternoon discussing teaching and children with the headmaster of what corresponded roughly to a middle schoolIt was in a remote rural areaHolmavika village of 300 inhabitants in the north-west peninsula of IcelandI asked about disciplinewondering how it compared with that at the central Scotland school where I taughtThe headmaster said that there had been no problems until the introduction of televisionAfter that they had begun to encounter the behavioural problems which had been occurring in Reykjavik and which are so depressingly familiar to us allAs a youngster in the 1950s my greatest delight was to run on to the pitch at Murrayfield after the full-time whistlepat my heroes on the back and not wash my hands for a weekmuch to the disgust of my motherFor reasons unknown this privilege has only recently been denied the young rugby followers of todayAt the Scotland-Wales match I was severely reprimanded by a steward 30 years my junior for daring to place one foot on the hallowed turf as I made my exit from the schoolboysenclosureDoes the alleged damage caused to the turf really warrant this controlas opposed to the pleasure gained by youngsters being allowed to run on to the pitch after the gameShrinkingA few years agoI wrote expressing my concern that the village of West LintonPeeblesshirehad movedfrom being 18 miles outside the GPO in Edinburgh to 16 and then to 14 milesThis fact was verified as being 16 by the road-sign in the village itselfbut it had shrunk to 14 via an advertisement in your newspaperNeedless to sayI was treated like a crankwas completely ignored by the so-called expertsand in general was subjected to ridicule by people who ought to know betternamely my own familyNonetheless I must stand my ground and restate that not only did it happen thenbut it is getting worseIn a recent advertisement for a house sale the same village of West Linton is now only 11 miles from EdinburghHow much longer will everyone ignore this phenomenonScottish cringeI am intrigued by James Rougvie's description of St Margaretin today's report on Dunfermline's 900th anniversary celebrationsas the Hungarian princess who civilised Malcolm CanmoreIs this Dunfermline's official lineIf soit shows the town suffering more than its fair share of the Scottish cringeI doubt if many Scottish historians would take this line nowadaysPersonallyI tend to see Malcolm's marriage to Margaret as part of a process by which our king invited in a team of management consultants from the Continent in order to alienate the land even further from the peopleWellthat's one kind of
