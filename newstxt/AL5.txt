Government contracta survey showed yesterdayTwo out of three dentists said they had extracted teeth that they might have filled before the contract was introducedMore than half said their pay last year had not increasedor even fellThe survey of 866 dentists in the dental journal The ProbesaysWhen dentists were asked whether they had extractedor referred for extractionany teeth which they might not have done before the introduction of the 1990 contract61 per cent said they hadwhile nearly 37 per cent said they had notMr Jeremy Cowanjournal editorsaid the contract's practical effect was to reduce preventive dentistry in favour of more extractionsThe conclusions were challenged by Mr Joe Richchairman of the British Dental Association's General Dental Services Committeewho said it was probably truethat more teeth were being extracted because dentists were seeing more patientsDentists had no financial incentive to extract teethhe saidThe extraction fee was Â£9 but the filling fee could be almost anythingdepending on the work neededMr Rich said many dentists were concerned that not enough money was being made available by the Government to implement the contract and he had

indigestion and ulcer tabletsThe NHS is not for saleVirginia Bottomley talks to George Jones in her first interview since joining the CabinetBy GEORGE JONESTHE NEW Health SecretaryMrs Virginia Bottomleyset herself an ambitious target yesterday to take the politicsout of the National Health ServiceBut her desire to provide a period of stability for nearly one million people employed by the NHS is coupled with a fierce determination to maintain the momentum of reformwith the overwhelming majority of hospitals becoming self-governing trusts by the mid-1990sLabour sought to turn the general election into a referendum on the NHSasking voters for a mandate to reverse the changesMrs Bottomley is convinced the Tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reforms and to give doctorsnurses and managers the confidence to make them workIn her first full interview since being appointed Health Secretaryshe said the election resultand Mr Major's unequivocal commitment to the NHShad finally nailed the lieabout privatisation of health careThe NHS is not for profitIt is not for saleIt will continue to be true to its founding principlesavailable to all and free at the point of deliveryshe saidShe recalled a promise made by Mr Major when he became Prime Ministerthat he would work for a nation at ease with itselfI want to see a health service at ease with itself optimistic and confident about its essential workHealth is something which touches every individual and family in the countryshe saidBut there must be changesAn organisation that doesn't change fossilisesHealth needs to develop and alterBy next yearshe is confident that two thirds of hospitals will have become self-governing trusts within the NHSShe pledged that the Government would safeguard those that did not opt for trust statusbut she expected this to be a minorityThe Government will also encourage more family doctors to hold budgets to buyservices for patientsand is looking at ways to enable smaller practices to team up to secure the advantages of fund holdingThe election result has given the Conservatives five years in which to press ahead with the changesMost people are likely to judge the reforms on how long they have to wait for treatment the issue behind the Jennifer's earcontroversy during the election campaignMrs Bottomley stressed her commitment to the Patient's Charterwhich has already eliminated almost all waits of more than two years for NHS operationsThe next step is to ensure thatfrom Marchno one should have to wait more than 18 months for a hip or knee replacement or a cataract operationA national standard will also be set for outpatient waiting timesMrs Bottomley's first big test as Health Secretary will come this summer with the annual public spending roundwhich will be conducted against a background of concern over high Government borrowing and pressure from the Tory Right for public spending cutsThe Conservative manifesto contained a commitment to increaseyear by yearthe level of real resourcescommitted to the NHS though it put no figure on the extra money to be allocatedMrs Bottomleyrepresenting caring Conservatismwill face Mr Michael Portillothe new Treasury Chief Secretarywho is equally keen to establish his Right-wing credentials by demonstrating he can keep keep a tight grip on the public purse stringsShe acknowledged that there could be difficult times aheadIt will always be the case that the holder of my office will need to fight the corner of the health service and there will alwaysinevitablybe more than we can doBut she stressed there would be no let-up in the search for greater efficiencyAs well as fighting for more moneyher task was to ensure that every last poundwas spent as effectively as it could beHer priorities include giving more encouragement to medical researchemphasis on preventive health to make the NHS a health as well as a sickness servicewith the publication shortly of new national targets for reducing deaths from heart disease and cancersand pressing ahead with care in the communityAs a former psychiatric social workerMrs Bottomley is determined to improve standards of care for mentally ill and handicapped peopleIt is not acceptable to have people who require a home confined to long-stay institutions when they could be in more domestic settingsThat is a real challengeshe saidMrs Bottomley's rise to the top has been swiftwith only four years between her first ministerial post and a seat at the Cabinet tableBut she bridles at suggestions that the inclusion of two women Mrs Gillian Shephard at the Department of Employment and herself has excluded more able men from the CabinetPrime Ministers always have to consider balance in the Cabinet and at least we now have the same number of women as old Etonians in John Major's teamshe saidFriday MattersMarital strife comes out in the washBy SUZANNE LOWRYFRENCH magazines love telling their women readers that while French lovers may be romanticFrench husbands are scruffybarely domesticated louts who don't clean their teethdon't shave at weekends and won't use deodorantsThe direst accusations always seem to centre on husbandly refusal to wash or change underwear and a tendency to wear socks in bedIf there is any truth in this colourful mythhow do the women stand itHow about their own standardsThe Frenchnotoriously obsessed with appearancesare disinclined to wash their dirty linen in publicBut sociologist Jean-Claude Kausmann has found out what they are doing with it in private in a major piece of research that takes the lid off the French marital laundry basketHe has definitively discovered what happens to socks and underwear once the wearers have been persuaded to shed themhow co-habiting men and women care for their most intimate garmentsand how couples come to joint terms with the washing machine or fail toHis two-year study of 20 couples reveals that the humbleoften smelly male sock is indeed at the centre of a secret linen war being waged up and down the landThe sock is a highly sensitive conjugal objecthe declares in La Trame Conjugale a cunning titlela trame means frameworkit can also mean linenSocks are often at the centre of the mini-wars at which couples engageFor instanceone of the bitterest reproaches from a wife to an untidy husband isYou might at least put away your socksSocks smell and get lostThey are also slightly ridiculous and can turn anger and tears to laughter very quicklyBut bewaresays KausmannThis laughter may not be a safety valve reducing tensionbut a device to conceal an urge to violenceKausmann is not a fetishist and is much more interested in the couple's relationship than in the efficiency of soap powderBut he believes that linen is the ideal instrument by which to probe the hidden depths of marital lifeLinen is everywhereall the timestuck to the couple like their skinhe writesIt is a reminder of the feminine role modified by ideas of equalityIt symbolises the subjugation of the individual to the joint personalityAt all timeshe claimslinen bears the traces of the war between the partnersDirty washing makes an equal division of tasks impossibleeven for those couples who wish to achieve itKausmann shows how far we have come from the 19th centurywhen a girl's linen boxfull of beautifully embroidered monogrammed sheetswas part of her dowryShreds of these hoards can now be picked over in provincial brocante shopsbrave remnants of anothermore confident ageSuch brides had cared for their treasureThese days laundry should be easier thanks to machinesEven a man can do itIroning is another matterGiven that Paris shop windows are piled with ever more beautiful bed and table linenthere must be plenty of that to doYoung bourgeois wivesI am toldsolved the problem by heaving the basket home to motherwho is still likely to have a bonne to wash itSome of Kausmann's female subjects did likewiseothers actually liked washingsome even ironed socksBut most others were desperate to avoid itOne was even teaching her husband to do itSome women in the study were obsessional about cleanliness and tidinessOne insisted on cleanliness but didn't care about tidinesswhile her husband didn't care about cleanliness but was fanatical about tidinessSabine begins the day by making her husband look at a pile of dirty washing by the bedAnne-Sophieon the other handlives a life wracked by doubt because she can never decide whether a garment is dirty or notEach time she tries to judge she suffers a feeling of agitation and indeed anguishHer chief horror is to have clothes lying around that are neither one thing nor the otherShe inspects the sceneshe smells the garmentEventually she puts it awaydeciding not to wash it because she hates ironingBut the malaise persists and all day she feels destabilisedOne of the most vexing problems is when and how to mingle the male and female laundrySome couples mix itsome don'tOne couplealasput too much strain on their new relationship by buying a washing machineBut then they couldn't bear the clothes to go in togetherThey tried having two machines but never had enough laundry to justify running them bothThey could reach no sane accommodation about sharing and areKausmann reportsno longer togetherOther families also experience other territorial difficultiesElaine cannot bear the thought of her husband using her handkerchiefWhile Sabine sees no need to wash table napkins after one partyThat would be stupidThey are not dirty because people have spat on them onceLeon and Madelainemeanwhilehave chairs on either side of their bed on which to put their respective clothesThey pile upMadelaine refuses to put Leon's awayThis bothers him deep downHe believes it is her jobOut loudhe complains about the pile on her chairShe resents thisWhen tasks are sharedit can be even worseAnne and Pat both do the laundry but have waged a nine-year guerrilla war over the temperature of the water in the machineAnne wants it at 30 degreesPat at 60 degreesThe dispute now rules their existenceAlthough they rarely speak about itPat puts his work clothes asideso he can wash them at 60 degreesBut Anne then does them at 30 degreesAfter she has washeddried and ironed the clotheshe quietly puts them all back in the machine at 60 degreesJean-Claude Kausmann doesn't get involved in laundering in his own home but he does do all the shopping and cookingAnd far from showing that the couple is going out of fashion in Francehe feels his research demonstrates that it is still at the centre of people's dreamsIt is just more and more complex and difficult to achieve the right water temperatureFriday MattersCALLED TO ORDERSUE BELGROVE had to tackle a wilderness when she
