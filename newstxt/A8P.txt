QuoteTODAYDe Klerk talks about beach apartheid and Separate Amenities Actbut what about those pillars of apartheid like the Group Areas Actthe Population Registration Act and the very fundamental laws that govern the political life of our countryWhat is the use of going to open beaches when we must return to segregated residential areas and schools and suffer under the laws that make the best medical treatment the prerogative of the whites only in our countryWhat is the point of bathing together in the beaches when in fact we cannot sit together to make the laws of our countryWe have demonstrated against petty apartheid because we are taking on the entire system of apartheid on all frontsBut these campaigns have never been isolated from the fundamental issue of powerthe issue of who rules our countrywho has this right to make and unmake the lawANC radioAddis AbabaNovember 17 BBC monitoringObituary Rene MuawadControversial conciliatorLEBANESE President Rene Muawadkilled in a

smiledWhat I'll be saying in a year's time I don't knowSeveral flights like thesesome from Budapest and Viennaare now arriving at Ben Gurion every weektheir human cargoes eloquent testimony to the swelling numbers of Soviet Jewish emigrants and the vast changes that Mikhail Gorbachev's policies have wrought in their homelandEconomic and political uncertainty and the rise of truculent local nationalisms from the Baltic to the Caspian have raised the ancient spectre of anti-Semitismnever far below the surface of Soviet lifeUnder glasnost and perestroikathe last great untapped pool of world Jewry is on the moveExact numbers are unavailable2.5 to three million is the accepted figurethough 70 years of cultural and religious suppressionintermarriage and assimilation means that the real number in Zionist terms those who qualify for automatic Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return may be far higherTurbulence at homecombined with an American decision to restrict Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Unionmean that the stream of emigration is now directed almost exclusively at IsraelThe challenge is immenseand no one is sure whether it can be metAccording to the latest projections100,000 Soviet Jews will arrive in Israel over the next three yearsand the numbers may be even higher if and when direct flights start from Moscow to Tel Avivthe most important tangible sign of the rapid thaw in Soviet-Israeli relationsIn comparative termssuch an influx is the equivalent of the movement of three million East Germans to West Germanya country unlike Israelwith a healthy economy where difficulties of acclimatization for the newcomers will be at a minimum and language problems non-existentIf the Russians do arrive on this scale it will be the largest single wave of what Israelis call aliya literally ascentsince the immediate post independence years in the early 1950sa heady return to the heart of the Zionist idea at a time when the country still fighting the Palestinian uprisingon a permanent war footing and its economy slipping into recession is far from readyTHE FIRST big wave of Russians came after the 1967 warwhen Zionist feelings were awakened by Israel's six day victory and Soviet support for the ArabsMoscow underestimated the phenomenonbelieving that if the hard core of provocateurswere allowed to emigrate the vast majority would stayThe emigration movement reached a peak in 1973 with 33,000 Jews leavingIt dipped after the Yom Kippur warrising again to 51,000 in 1979Until 1982 figures dropped steadily againreaching a low point in 1986Even in the good years Israel had only a shareBetween 1968 and 1988 280,000 Jews emigratedbut only 165,000 came to IsraelIn 1988 the drop-out rate reached a staggering 92 per centBut in the first 10 months of 1989 alone over 7,000 have arrivedand there are expected to be 10,000 by the end of the yearThe new wave is not in the heroic mould of famous refusenikslike Anatoly ScharanskyIda Nudel and Josef Begunwho finally arrived in Israel after years of persecutionexile and imprisonmentFew of the newcomers know any Hebrew and few have more than the vaguest idea about IsraelMany would have preferred AmericaWith the Berlin Wallthe most famous barrier of allfallingthe more media-conscious activists among the Soviet Jews already here are warning that Israel is just not prepared for the influxIsrael's lack of preparedness for mass Soviet Jewish immigration is psychologically understandable but not politically forgivablesays Yuri Sterna Muscovite who came in 1981Its very difficult to appreciate a revolutionto see today as really qualitativelydramatically different from the day beforeIts difficult to go beyond normal scepticism and see this huge number not just as a potential but as a realityIsraelis are pleased with the change in the US regulationswhich effectively signal an end to the drop-out phenomenonIsraelsays one senior officialhas never been interested in emigration as suchbut in aliya in having as many Jews as possible come to IsraelIn this perspectiveplaces like the Ladispoli transit camp near Romewhere thousands of Soviet Jews are still awaiting visas to the USare a disgraceA thriving Jewish life in New York's Brighton Beach will not reinforce IsraelFreedom of choice is no longer on the agendaespecially now that American Jews have discovered that it is easier to raise money for absorbing Soviet Jews in Israel than it is for resettling them in the USThe Israeli government has been agonisingly slow to take up the challengealthough it has calculated that US$3 billion will be needed over three years for housingjob creation and other aspects of large-scale immigrant absorptionThe bureaucracy certainly needs streamliningthe immigrants are met initially by the Absorption Ministrybut once in the country many of their needs are looked after by the Jewish Agencythe semi-private organisation that dates back to the early years of Jewish settlement in PalestineThe two bodies are often at loggerheadsand there are constant disputes over methodsare the newcomers best served by direct absorption being given money and subsidies for their first year and then left to cope on their ownor by being placed in one of the 38 Jewish Agency absorption centresLEARNING Hebrew is a priority for alland places in the famous ulpan system are
