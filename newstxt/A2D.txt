saysBy JOHN LICHFIELDWhere are the TV westerns of yesteryearWhat happened to Ben CartwrightHoss and Little JoeWhere is the Wagon Train that seemed permanently to be circling its wagons waiting for a drunken pioneer's wife to have twins in the last of themThe TV western seemed to fade into the sunset some time in the mid-1970svictim of a narcissistic age that preferred to look at prosperoussmart-alecky or violent images of itself DallasCheersMiami ViceIt was a time when children were encouraged to fantasize about machines and outer space rather than marvel at the open spaces where the deer and buffalo roamedNowhoweverit seemsthe wheel has turned full circleThe western is being revivedreinterpreted for the 1990sOne of the most successful Hollywood TV producersDavid Jacobsthe creator of Dallasbelieves the western also fell victim to late 1960s iconoclasmThe John Wayne stereotype was rejectedalong with his conservative valueshe saidA series of spoof or obsessively realistic 1960s westerns Cat BalouButch Cassidy and the Sundance KidSoldier BlueThe Wild Bunchstripped the mask from the Lone Ranger's faceThe legend could not be taken seriously any longer in what had beenadmittedlya threadbare formHoward RosenbergTV critic of the Los Angeles TimessaidJust look at the re-runs of the old western seriesYou had heroes scotch-taped to their horses and lightly sprinkled with dustYou can't get away with that any moreJohn Mantleyproducer of Gunsmoke for CBS for 11 yearssays elements of the old story began to fall apartWe all read Bury My Heart at Wounded KneeWe knew that the US Government had signed 453 treaties with the Indians and broken every oneA part of the myth just didn't work after thatAt their peak in the mid-60sthere were 39 western series on the three American TV networks almost two a day on each channelIn the US weekly audience ratings in 1965there were three westerns in the top fiveand seven in the top 10By the mid-80s they had all gone the way of the buffaloextinct save for preservation in the national park of permanent re-runsGene Autrythe first TV cowboynow 82says westerns dominated the early days of TV partly because they had livelycheaply produced visualsbut mainly because early TV was starved of feature films by the studiosWesterns were a handy substituteThere are encouraging signshoweverthat the TV western is struggling back into the saddleParadiselaunched on CBS last season and shown on BBC1 this summerwas the first new western serial for a decadeIt was the only new drama series in US network TV to be allowed a second series this yeardespite a relatively lowly 49th ranking in the ratingsIts creator and executive producer isperhaps surprisinglyDavid JacobsWhy did he follow J R Ewingthe epitome of 1980s TVwith a western about a gunfighter turned foster fatherI believed the genre was still an important and powerful oneIt's something I've always had an affection forI found it was possible with Paradise to talk about individual and personal responsibilitysomething which if set in a contemporary context would have had a preachy feel about itLonesome Dovea five-part story of a Texas-to-Montana cattle drivealso shown on CBS last yearwas the best-watched TV mini-series of any kind in America for five yearsIt won substantial critical acclaim and will show in Britain next yearThe 1989-90 seasonwhich started this monthbrought another new prime-time western seriesABC's Young Riderswhich tells the story of the Pony ExpressIt also says a lot about modern American TVBecause the networks believe westerns appeal mainly to middle-aged menYoung Riders has a cast of five pouting young male actorsin an attempt to make a western with good demographicsThe effect is rather like an extended advertisement for Marlboro LightsWesterns are no longer a cheap optionThe classic western TV series were filmed in back-lotsor in the semi-desert 20 miles from Los AngelesModern audiences no longer accept plastic bushesand the southern Californian suburban sprawl means the production companies have to take their horses and cows to locations far away in Arizona or MontanaDavid Jacobs also points out that the cost of hiring a stage-coach is now prohibitiveAt one time there were dozens of companies which specialised in renting out western paraphernaliaNow there are maybe twoThe cost has gone through the barn roofAnd actors can no longer rideThey have to be sent to cowboy schoolWesternsby their naturedemand more time on locationAs a resultMr Jacobs saysit cost nearly as much to make an episode of Paradisewith relatively unknown actorsas an episode of Dallaswith its big starsWill the western ride againJohn Mantley is cautiousWesterns have a gladiatorialtimeless qualityOn the other hand you have a whole generation of TV watchers that doesn't really know the rulesA western is like a Japanese Noh playIt is a stylised drama with understated dialogue that depends on recognition of key words and conceptsMany of the young people today haven't the first idea of what's going onIn the inert 1950s the western represented a troubledadventurous American pastIn the anxious and eventful late 1980s and 1990sthey may come to representlike All Creatures Great and Small in Britaina less confusing past with simplerdeeper valuesMaybeOn the other hand The Young Riders came 51st in the ratings in its first weektrailing farfar behind all the modern myths about modern times such as The Cosby ShowRoseanneGolden GirlsCheers and MatlockIt is prematurethento say that the western has galloped back to centre screenBut there is a puff of dust on the horizonMediaA discreet facelift for Le MondeSarah Lambert greets the relaunch of France's august paper of recordnow aiming at younger readersBy SARAH LAMBERTTHE LAST 10 days or so have not so much shaken the world as utterly changed itLe MondeFrance's daily newspaper of recordhas been redesigned and relaunched with the help of a Fr25m advertising campaign which proclaimsLe Monde is changingLe Monde is not just a newspaper but an institutionFounded after the war with de Gaulle's blessingits official brief was to recreate a national consensus and rekindle public faith in the Press which the collaborationist newspapersof the war years had almost extinguishedThat it is now required reading for the French Establishment and for anybody involved in business or education is a measure of how successfully it fulfilled its task without compromising a reputation for unbiased reportingBecause the country has a very strong regional pressLe Monde is not France's bestselling paper but is unique in that 85,000 of the 385,000 copies bought daily are sold abroadFor many readersLe Monde's view of the world is France's view of the worldThat view is presented in a classical Frenchrarely illustratedand then only with the smallest photographs or the occasional line drawingIt follows an editorial policy that believes foreign news should lead the first three pagesthat matters of national interest should be philosophically debated in the newspaper's columnsand that half a page of sport either side of the weekend is enoughHaving survived a financial crisis in the early 1980sthanks to support from the banks and from a staff prepared to agree to a voluntary wage freezethe paper is now making money and putting on readersso why has the management now decided to modernise the titleOn first sight it might seem a case of plus ca changeplus c'est la meme choseThe differences are minimalcleaner printa slightly smaller format somewhere between tabloid and broadsheetthe masthead underlined in blue andthe most striking developmentthe appearance of separate sectionsButas the editor Andre Fontaine explainsIt is not so much a new layout as a new presentationNewspaper readers are very conservative the changes are not supposed to shockAs in BritainFrench newspapers are having to respond to the growing demand for advertising space by adding extra pagesLe Mondeone of the country's most profitable publishing concerns producing special supplements and books while printing other publicationshas invested a sum conservatively estimated at not less than Fr350m in a state-of-the-art printing pressThe pressat Ivrya suburb south-east of Parisis the most technologically advanced in Europe and will enable Le Monde to print in colour and to produce 64-page newspapera third as much againWith so many pagesthe decision to divide the paper into separate sectionshome and foreign newssociety and cultureeconomics and business news with special supplementsbooks and ideas on Fridayarts and listings on Thursday and a radio/television guide at the weekendhas been dictated by the problems of readability as much as anything elseThe paper was just getting too unwieldlywe needed to give our readers some help in finding their way around the papersays Mr FontaineHe also hopes the new format will attract new readersboth those who do not regularly read a daily newspaper and converts from the rival Liberation which has won an extraordinary success among younger readers with its mix of lively writingnews features and bold use of photography and designMr Fontaine admits that the society and culture section of the new-look Le Monde has been inspired by Liberation's treatment of similar subject-matterSo many stories drugs or immigrationfor exampleare international stories and should be written from a point of comparisonset in their international contextThat takes time to researchand space to displayThat so-called softsubjects like health are now valid areas of inquiry and sport merits better and more detailed coverage has now been realisedThe colour-printing facilityinitially to be used only for advertisingmay be used to produce a weekend leisurecolour supplement early next yearI don't believe in the fatal decline of the written wordsays Mr Fontainebut we are competing all the time not so much against televisionbecause the screen image and the printed word complement each otheras against magazinesand against the time people spend getting to work and then their leisure time against music and the cinemaNot all the Le Monde journalists support the changewhich is the result of two years' market research and several dummy editionsA professional designerJean Baylewith a track record for breathing new life into tired titleswas hired but the changes he favoured were deemed rather too radical andin the end as is often the case on Le Monde where the staff hold a significant stake in the company the consensus view prevailedFor the chief sub-editorDaniel Vernetit has not been an easy transitionWe had to make sure that the paper read as a single publicationbut that each section stood up on its ownwhile avoiding undue repetitionhe explainsAll this disruption coincides with preparations to move to a new offices early next monthwhen all editing and layout will be done on computersMeanwhilethere are plans to change the management structure so as to divide responsibility for editorial contentday-to-day management and the business side of the Le Monde publishing empire more logicallyThe task will undoubtably fall heaviest on Andre Fontainewho with the death earlier this summer of the newspaper's founder Hubert Beuve-Meryhas to shoulder the burden aloneI look aroundhe saysand there is no one there behindThe differences he and his production team have introduced may be ones of detailbut are no less revolutionary for thatWhatever the readers' perceptionLe Monde is changing and will go on doing so for some time to comeMediaWomen's monthly magazinescirculation figuresBy SARAH LAMBERTWOMEN'S monthly magazines are battling it out in an extremely
