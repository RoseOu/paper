Revenge has no part in bidsays MulcahyBy Ben LauranceGEOFF Mulcahythe soft-spoken chief executive and chairman-elect of Kingfisherinsisted last night that in launching his £460 million bid for Dixonsthat revenge was the last thing in mindThis is a straight commercial exercisehe saidWe believe we can turn around this businessThe argument should not be confused by talk of revengeBut there is a certain piquancy in Kingfisher now trying to turn the tables on a company from whose clutches its escaped by a whisker only three years agoIn 1986Dixons was the darling of the CityIt was cashing in a spectacular consumer boomKingfisher or Woolworths as it was then called was still being reshaped under the guidance of Mulcahy and his teamwho had spearheaded a buy-out of the company from its US parent four years earlierNowit is Kingfisher which has become a favourite not because the people at the helm have great shopkeeping flair but because their cautious and unflamboyant management style has created a retailing empire of solid reliabilityThe Mulcahy approach could hardly be more different from that of Stanley Kalmsthe creator and chairman of the Dixons empireKalms is an instinctive entrepreneurHe joined his father's portrait photography business at the age of 16 just after the war and soon realised that selling cameras was more lucrative than taking picturesThe business grew Topsy-like as Dixons stacked its shelves with electrical and photographic equipment from low-cost suppliers in the Far EastCurrys was taken over in 1984two years before the unsuccessful £1.8billion bid for WoolworthsNowDixons is sufferingProfitsabove £100million in 1987/88are likely to fall to £45million in the year to next AprilThe surplus will come from things like property developmentfinancial services and the US electrical offshootSilothe 350 Dixons and 600 Currys outlets are losing moneyAttempts to move Currys gradually out of the high street to larger edge-of-town and out-of-town stores and to tone down Dixons' garish image have yet to bear fruitMeanwhileKingfisher has prosperedembracing far more than the relics of the British end of Frank Winfield Woolworth's creationWoolworths opened its first British shop in Liverpool 80 years agothrived on its nothing more than 6dformula until the second world warlumbered through the the 60s and 70s and came into the embrace of Mulcahy's team with more than 1,000 outletsIt has been cut back to 700 shopseach with just six departmentsAdd in CometSuperdrug and B&Qand that is Kingfisherrun with little of the flair which Dixons showed in its heyday but perfectly poised to withstand a downturnPAGEEurope to drop Japan car curbsBy Alan Hope in BrusselsQUOTAS which restrict imports of Japanese cars to Europe are to be dropped from the end of 1992in return for greater access to the Japanese market for European carmakersthe EC Commission said yesterdayThe Commission also confirmed that there would be no repeat of the rowearlier this yearover the local content of Nissan cars built in Britain and exported to the rest of EuropeCars produced in Europe are supposed to be European carsMr Frans Andriessenthe EC's External Relations Commissioner saidFive countries currently maintain national quotas on imports of Japanese cars -FranceItalySpainPortugal and the UKAccording to the Commissionthey should be progressively reduced as soon as possible most likely from the start of 1991On January 11993quotas will disappear but Japanese exports will continue to be strictly monitoredThe Community will keep the option of introducing safeguard measures if imports produce too much of a threat to the European industryThe decision on the Community's policy comes after months of debate in the 17-member CommissionThe Commission proposes that 1993 be the start of a transition period of indefinite durationduring which quotas will be lifted while imports are tightly monitoredIn any casean open European market will make national quotas impossible to enforceThe Japanese will be offered greater access to Europeon condition that they open their domestic markets not only for cars but for a whole range of industrial and service sectors to European businessmenThe Commission hopes that the threat of new restrictions on carsthis time on the Europe-wide levelwill spur the Japanese to do more in this area than they have to datePAGEAdjusting the Delors vision of a Social Charter to the needs of greater Europe NotebookBy Edited by Alex BrummerTHE main focus of British angst at the Strasbourg Summit is likely to be the Social CharterBut it is also plain that despite sterling's depreciation to a rate at which it might be reasonably competitive within the Exchange Rate MechanismMrs Thatcher's team are no more ready to sign on the dotted line than they were in Madrid this summerThe Strasbourg smokescreen will be differentThe Whitehall-propagated view is that the changes in Eastern Europe are so momentous they render European Monetary Uniona common fiscal policy and the charter obsoleteInstead of focusing on the narrow agenda of Delors the new Europe should be more forward lookingIt should examine the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe and issues of global importance in Europe such as pollution rather than pussyfooting with the Social CharterAs far as the charter is concerned they may be on the right track if for the wrong reasonsAlthough the aims of the charter are laudableensuring adequate social securitythe right of employees to join a union and the right to strikeamong other thingsthey could be unworkable if one assumes that some closer links between the emerging countries of the Eastern bloc and the West including German reunificationOne obvious problempointed out in the most recent issue of the National Institute Economic Reviewis the issue of relative labour costsA charter which encouraged the poorer countries to move towards the best practice in the richer nations would clearly affect competitiveness in the less well-off statesIf this already were true in traditional free market economiesimagine the gap to be closed with countries emerging from the iron hand of Stalinist controlIt would be clearly better for the UKgiven its dismal failure on the inflation frontto be exposed to the discipline of the ERM irrespective of developments further to the EastBut when it comes to the Social Charter there may well be a case for slowing the grandiose Delors ideasStateside bolt-holeTIMING was not on the side of Thames Television yesterday as it unveiled the £57million purchase of American TV production house ReevesFresh in the market's mind was the shambles which has engulfed TVS following its expensive foray into the American television marketThe purchase of MTM is likely to wipe out the second-half profits of TVS this yearThames is also choosing to launch the transatlantic venture its first major takeover as all eyes are focused on the British market where the Government will today reveal the details of its new broadcasting legislation including proposals to force ITV contractors to compete in an auction for the renewal of their franchisesShares in Thames slipped on fears that the company may not be able to shake off the jinx which has dogged so many American acquisitions by British foragersBut chairman Sir Ian Trethowan described it as a cost effectiveway into the US market which will add the adolescent delights of sitcoms such asGimme a Breakto Thames's programme libraryThe company is also hoping to exploit the link to pump its own programmes out to the thousands of mainstream and cable stations in AmericaPlunging into the midst of a soft US market may not look clever in the short termparticularly since Thames's own revenue is starting to feel the effects of the slowdown in advertising spendingBut America is still the largest television market and Thames now has a footholdIf disaster strikes and the company is outbid by one of the many expected rivals for its lucrative London franchise the largest in Britain Reeves could provide a bolt-holeLaw's delayTHERE is a growing belief in Parliament and among the hapless investors of Barlow Clowes that the Ombudsman's report into the Department of Trade and Industry's role in the affair willin partbe suppressed on sub judice groundsThe legal fall-out of the £190million scandal and the criminal cases which have resulted from it mean thaton grounds of fairness aloneit would not be right to pre-judge the trials due to start next yearSir Anthony Barrowclough's report couldindeedbe viewed in those terms and holding back some of the more sensitive parts would be consistent with the Serious Fraud Office's efforts to restrain some of the most recent civil court hearings on the affairHoweverthe SFO's handling of its investigations has hardly been consistent and it already has set a precedent for the Barrowclough report to be published in fullThe best case in point is the publication of the DTI report into the Blue Arrow affair which came before the arrest and subsequent charging of the 11 defendantsIt is no wonderthereforethat many people believe the current delay in publishing the Barrowclough investigation is for reasons of political expediency rather than legalistic necessityThe crux of the matter is whether compensation should be paid to the investorsif Sir Anthony has thus decidedthen the Government should duly obligeIn these days of financial sweetenerssurely there are more votes in rescuing 18,000mainly elderlyinvestors from dire financial plight just as there is ensuring that the UK's last home-grown car manufacturer remains in British handsPAGEBNFL to revivenuclear powerBy Patrick Donovan Industrial CorrespondentTHE development of Britain's atomic power programme could be resurrected under plans being considered by British Nuclear Fuels which is looking at the feasibility of establishing itself as a major player in the post-privatisation electricity marketAlthough the Government's recent decision to pull all atomic reactors from the sell-off programme and scrap the construction of three Pressurised Water Reactors was expected to freeze Britain's civil nuclear programme for at least five yearsBNFL yesterday disclosed that it was looking at ways of diversifying into generating powerDeclaring that the Department of Energy's about-turn will result in merely a temporary interruptionto atomic developmentchairman Mr Christopher Harding admitted that the nuclear industry's image has been damaged by fears about nuclear wasteDespite the wealth of evidence that nuclear power can never under-price fossil fuel-generated electricityBNFL is looking at ways of competing for supply in the open marketProposals involve the possible construction of up to four PWRs on existing BNFL sites at Calder Hall at Sellafield and Chapelcross in ScotlandThe new plant would have capacity of between 600 and 2,400 megawatts of powerThe company is also planning to expand the life of the existing Magnox reactors by another 10 yearsDevelopment costs could be reduced by expanding these existing nuclear sites which are currently used primarily to produce fuel for military purposesConstruction could be caried out as a joint venture with the new state-owned company set up to operate all existing nuclear plantAny BNFL output would have to compete on commercial groundsPAGEOfficial figures are hard to credit as families fail to claim benefitBy Mike GeorgeASTAGGERING

provided at least one adult is working at least 24 hours a weekWhen it was introduced in place of the old family income supplement scheme last yearjust 38 per cent of those entitled claimed family creditThe government subsequently altered its estimate of those able to claim and came up with a 50 per cent take-up rateAnd now Tony Newton's social security department is hoping a recent £7 million

$170 before the October 1987 crash and instead of recovering with the Index have just touched a seven-year low at $96This week IBM unveiled plans to shed another 10,000 employees about 4.5 per cent of its US workforce saving $1billion a year and it will buy back another $4billion-worth of its own sharesUnfortunately for IBMits problems are not simply that it has too many staffIts problems are not even simpleThey include threats to its hardwareits software and its networking systemas well as the weakness of the US economywhich is affecting many other suppliersAlthough the US economy is not in recessionit has visibly slowedProfits have fallen for three consecutive quarters and capital spending has fallen in responseSpending on information technology has also declineddemonstrating that the computer industry is no longer recession-proofLarge suppliers such as IBMDEC and Unisys have undoubtedly sufferedBut even in a bad market some firms do better than othersHewlett-Packardfor examplemanaged to grow its annual sales 21 per cent to $12billionand Apple managed a 30 per cent increase to $5billionAnd Compaqcompeting directly against IBM in desktop PCsincreased sales by 36 per cent and profits by 51 per centin its latest quarterThis suggests IBM's problems may be more fundamentalIn facttoday's three major computer industry trends towards downsizingportable operating systems and open networks are all working against IBMDownsizingsimply means that firms are tending to buy smaller computers to do jobs which used to require big onesand big computers are where IBM makes most of its moneyDownsizing has been made possible by the growing power of the microprocessor and the new economies of smallGiven that microcomputer power costs a tenth of the price of minicomputer powerwhile minicomputer power costs a tenth of the price of mainframe powera small shift in this direction can make a dramatic difference to revenuesPortable operating systemssuch as Unixare also a threat to IBM and other companies which once prospered on proprietary onessuch as Wang and Data GeneralTraditionallycomputer manufacturers have used proprietary software to lock inuserswho would then find it impossible or prohibitively expensiveto move their applications to other manufacturers' machines or evenin IBM's casedifferent machines from the same manufacturerThis strategy is being made obsolete by Unixan openoperating system that runs on hundreds of different computers from hundreds of different manufacturersfrom micros and minis through mainframes to supercomputersMoving applications becomes relatively simpleand turns hardware into a commodityManufacturers can no longer charge according to some idea of valuebut must compete on price and performanceThis can have a dramatic effect on marginsOpen networking provides the means for computers from different vendors to be connected together using OSI open systems interconnectionstandardsOSI enables all the different manufacturers to work to a common set of standardsAgain this works against IBMwhich is irrevocably committed to its own proprietary networking systemSNAThese changes are not just a matter of following technological devlopmentsbut reflect the way businesses are changingMajor firms like General Motors and Heinz no longer see themselves as machines needing only periodic maintenance to run foreverThey are no longer isolated and no longer see computers as providing mainly internal services such as payroll and stock controlInsteadlarge corporations are becoming more like living organismscontinually changing and adaptingThey must interact with the outside worldand networks of computers are the way to do itExamples include electronic data interchange EDIordering stocks and materials and paying bills electronicallyinstead of using paper factory automation and JIT just-in-timeproduction systemsIBM wants to compete in all these markets and is apparently enthusiastic about AIX its version of Unixand OSIBut open systems are backed by governments and controlled by committeeswhich means IBM cannot dominate or control themAlso by competing it risks cannibalising its own best profit sourcesIBM selling an AS/400 mini is a triumph if the buyer would otherwise have chosen a DEC VAXbut a financial disaster for IBM if it replaces an IBM mainframeAlthough one IBM manager recently got widespread publicity for pointing out that PCs were overtaking mainframes as IBM's largest source of revenuesthis is misleadingIBM's revenues from mainframe processors in calendar 1988 may have been only about $12billionbut sales of peripherals $11billionsoftware $8billionand maintenance $7billionshould be added to thisPerhaps two-thirds of IBM's income and an estimated 75 per cent of profits are still tied up in this threatened areaThere's no way round thatAs one IBMer saidYou can't build a $60billion corporation out of selling $400 networking cardsPAGEMassive surge in traded options contracts before £480 million offer attracts suspicion Kingfisher's bid for Dixons sparks insider dealing investigationBy Ben LauranceEVIDENCE of widespread insider dealing ahead of yesterday's £480million bid for Dixons was being investigated by Stock Exchange officials last nightRecords show a huge surge in deals on the high-riskhigh-return traded options market 24 hours before Kingfisherthe Woolworths-to-B&Q retailing empire unveiled its takeover offer for the troubled Dixons groupLast week saw an average 100 traded options contracts traded each dayEach contract covers the right to buy or sell 1,000 Dixons shares at a given price in the futureOn Mondayactivity was similarly subdued163 contracts were recordedBut on TuesdayExchange records show that activity on the traded options market leapt to 2,601 contractscovering 2.6 million Dixons sharesThe price of an option to buy a share in Dixons for 100p next March doubled between Tuesday night and yesterday afternoon when details of the Kingfisher bid were unveiledSpeculators who bought the options before the bid and sold 24 hours later showed a 100 per cent profitThere is no suggestion that people directly involved with Kingfisher profited from knowing that a bid was imminentBut company executives accept that there must have been a leak as they put together a financing package to back their bid for DixonsAfter the price of Dixons shares staged a strong rise on TuesdayKingfisher felt obliged to broadcast a statement to the Stock Exchange first thing yesterday morning saying a bid was in the offingKingfisher says that even if there had been no leakthe bid would probably have been launched this weekDetails of the takeover terms were announced yesterday afternoonSources within the Stock Exchange confirmed yesterday that the sudden pre-bid surge in the traded options market is being examined by an insider dealing investigation team which looks at suspicious activity ahead of the release of price-sensitive informationKingfisher's bid comes little more than three years after it fought off a £1.8billion takeover attempt by DixonsThe Kingfisher groupwhose name was changed from Woolworths earlier this yearincludes about 720 high street shops under the Woolworths nameelectrical retailer Comet with 307 outletsBritain's leading DIY groupB&Qand Superdrugthe high street chain which last week announced that it is buying Medicare from the Gateway supermarket chain's new owners IsoscelesThe Dixons chairmanMr Stanley Kalmsis expected to issue a formal rejection of the Kingfisher offer this morningKingfisher risks having its bid held up by a Monopolies Commission investigation because of the grip it would have on the electrical retailing market if it controlled Dixons and Currys as well as CometThe company insists that a takeover would give it only 22 per cent of the total market for white and brown goods everything from washing machines and fridges to video recorders and hi-fi and small electrical appliancesThis would be below the level which normally triggers a monopolies probeHoweverfigures from market researchers Verdict suggest that in 1988Comet had 7.6 per cent of the marketLasky's since bought by Kingfisher 1.2 per cent and Dixons almost 18 per centThat would mean a takeover would give Kingfisher over 26 per centDixons has been one of the first retail chains to suffer from the slowing of retail demandIt has also been hit by the lack of new products to draw shoppers into its stores and the failure of satellite TV to take off as hopedProfits fell from £103million in 1987/88 to £78million last year and are expected to fall to £45million in the current 12 monthsKingfisher is offering 120p cash for each Dixons sharebut analysts think that much more will be needed to win controlDixons shares stood at 141p last nightKingfisher says it would speed up the closure of small Currys outlets and the shift to larger out-of-town sitesPAGEBritish Land's shares soar on split-up plansBy Larry Elliott Economics CorrespondentSHARES in John Ritblat's British Land soared yesterday after the property group announced it was splitting the company in two in an attempt to provide a better deal for shareholdersA quarter of the group's assets worth £339million will be sold to a new listed companyNew British Landwhich will operate in the manner of the old group and look to expand its portfolio of propertiesThe remaining chunk of British Land's existing portfolio including all its blue-chip investments such as Plantation House in the City of London will be sold offMr Ritblat said yesterday that he was prepared to sell the properties off piecemeal and had put no timescale on the disposal of assetsbut that it was conceivable that a big foreign investor might move in to buy the portfolio in its entiretyHoweverhe stressed that the offer would have to be considerably more than the break-up value of the portfolioAlong with the rest of the property sectorBritish Land's shares have been trading at a considerable discount to its assets per shareand yesterday's move is an attempt to close the 40 per cent gap which built up as institutions took a dimmer view of the marketGovernment changes to the tax system in recent years had allowed the company to come up with a solution which would make shares which had been trading at less than £3 last month to £5Mr Ritblat saidLast night British Land shares closed at 403pup 46p on the 357p they were trading at when suspended on TuesdayAs part of the dealBritish Land's existing shareholders will receive 13 shares in the new company for every 40 they ownThere will also be a tender offer to repurchase 10 per cent of British Land's shares at 420ptogether with a voucher for the associated tax credit worth 89pMr Ritblat said he and his fellow directors were showing their commitment to New British Land by investing almost £12million in cash into the new companywhich he said would concentrate on the UK but also look for overseas opportunities provided by the creation of the Single European marketAnalysts said they expected the group to have no big problems persuading shareholders to approve the restructuring plans at an extraordinary general meeting on December 21The scheme is beautifully tax-efficientone analyst saidBut the success of the restructuring depended on the speed and

reorganisation and redundancy costThe company has slashed the dividendwhich is being paid out of reservesThe company admitted it had been a tough yearbut said the second half had seen a substantial recoveryin performance of the main communications businesses as costs were controlledCentral staff numbers have been cut by a quarterincluding the closure of the office in Washington DCAfter those cutstrading profits of the communications division were more than double those in the first half year and marginally ahead of the second half of last year as business held upBut profits continued to fall in the troubled consultancy division which is up for saleAnd a £27million swing in interest costs left trading profits before tax virtually halved at £61millionAfter taxreorganisation costs and preference dividends that turned into a loss of £58millionbut despite the loss the company is paying a minimal final dividendAfter careful thought it was decided that a final dividend of 1.6p be recommendedthe board statedmaking a dividend of 9p for the yearWe believe this level to be sustainableThe group is negotiating the sale of its remaining consultancy businesses and says this will leave it with a strong and focused base in advertising and marketing servicesCharles and Maurice Saatchi have stepped back from the top executive roles and have recruited Frenchman Robert Louis-Dreyfus as chief executiveDespite the results and the dividend being lower than expectedSaatchi shares rose 15p yesterday on hopes of a takeover bidOutlookpage 13 PAGESaatchi crumbles as Thatcher's star wanes OutlookBy Roger CoweIT IS grimly appropriate that as Mrs Thatcher's star wanes the fortunes of the advertising agency which shot her to stardom should also crumbleIt remains to be seen whether either can bounce backand whether Saatchi and Saatchi will soon be fighting off a rather more vigorous takeover bid than Mrs Thatcher faced this weekBut for the moment there is precious little good news from the brothers who built the world's largest advertising agency from a standing start 19 years agoin the process building Mrs Thatcher into a formidable vote-winner and doing themselves no end of good therebyThe cracks were already beginning to show at the moment of their greatest triumphEven as Mrs Thatcher stood triumphant for the third time on the stairs at Central Office the applauding apparatchiks were already honing the knives for the Saatchi team which was blamed for various mid-campaign woesAnd as the Saatchi shares peaked ahead of the 1987 stock market crash the seeds of its financial decline had already been sownThe shoots were pushing their heads above the ground even though the group was still able to claim record profits as late as January of this yearIn his statement with the annual report chairman Maurice Saatchi described the group as the most successful company of the decadeTwo months later the truth was outAt the annual meeting in March Mr Saatchi warned that profits would fall this year although nobody expected they would fall nearly as much as they have doneand there would be disposalsBusiness was bad in the main communicationsdivision while the consultancy operation was in big troubleCosts everywhere were out of controlThree years ago the agency was clearly struggling for profitabilitycoming well down the annual leagaue table for the industry prepared by accountants Spicer and OppenheimThe illusion of success was maintained only because the group's high share price enabled it to buy companies on the cheap and so keep pushing up total profits and earnings per shareNow the illusion is well and truly shattered and the only reason the share price has not plunged much further than it has is the hope that some brave soul will put the group out of its misery with a takeoverIn fact the share price rose 15p yesterday on just such hopes despite the fact that the results were much worse than expectedThe company was putting a brave face on it yesterdayas can only be expectedThe second half represented a substantial recoverythe company saidTrading profits in the communications division were more than double the figure for the first half year thanks to the cost control programmeNew executives had been appointedFour consulting companies had been soldBut in fact the worse may not yet be overThe doubling of profits in Communications brings the level back only to what it was in the second half of last yearConsultancy profits were down again from the poor first half levelInterest costs ate a great hole in what profits were left and will continue at a high level unless the group can raise substantial sums from asset salesThere is still no sign of a buyer for the main consultancy businessHayand uncertainty over whether an agreement is imminent on Gartner GroupAnd executives are still leaving even before new chief executive Robert Louis-Dreyfus and his finance director have joined the groupTheir task is unenviableThe whole rationale of a global advertising business is under questionBut quite apart from that the group faces difficult timesCosts may now be under controlafter 750 redundancies and the Washington office closed along with cuts in New York and LondonBut now the pressure will shift to revenues as the advertising industry environment soursSo far Saatchi and Saatchi has maintained its ability to win new business and remarkably has clung on to its status among advertisersonly recently being voted the best all-round agencyBut advertising is a mercurial businessMuch depends on the intangibles which produce whatever it is in the ether that allows creative sparks to igniteIn the past those intangibles have been fed by the group's apparent invincibilityBut who knows what debilitating effect sackings and losses will have on those vital fluidsPerhaps we will never knowForeign bodies have already appeared on the Saatchi share register and despite its problems the group would clearly be a juicy prize for someone such as the fast-expanding FrenchIt would be even more grimly appropriate for Saatchi to be swallowed by the French just as Mrs Thatcher lost her struggle to prevent the pound being swallowed into the European Monetary SystemPAGETiphook confidentContainer group Tiphook yesterday said it was still confident of winning its joint £643million bid for Sea

has already suspended production at one of its main assembly plants and cut back on managerial staffIt has announced plans to cut $1billion from its budget next year to cope with a slump in car

risesBy Daniel JohnMORE than 600 of the original 18,000 investors caught up in the collapse of the Barlow Clowes investment empire have died during the 18 month-long battle to secure compensationit was revealed yesterdayThe death toll has worked out at the equivalent of seven a week since the two companies responsible for investing £190million in government securities went into liquidation last JuneMany who invested in UK-based Barlow Clowes Gilt Managers and its Gibraltar sister operationBarlow Clowes Internationalwere elderly people whose plight has been made worse by the loss of their savingsThe latest number of deaths were released yesterday as the Barlow Clowes Investors Group BCIGsought to secure the release of the Parliamentary Ombudsman's report into the Department of Trade and Industry's role in the affairThe draft written by Sir Anthony Barrowcloughthe Ombudsmanis currently in the hands of the DTI for factual checkingInvestors have been expecting its publication for the last two weeks but are fearful it will be kept back for the week when Parliament goes into the Christmas recessThat will prevent MPs scrutinising the report in detail and from questioning Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley about the DTI's role in allowing Barlow Clowes to operate over the years leading up to its collapseThere are also indications that the current criminal investigation into Barlow Clowes may prevent the most sensitive parts from being releasedBCIG representativesincluding chairman John Dyeryesterday lobbied key MPs in an effort to secure the report's earliest releaseAn early day motion has also been put down in the House of Commons supporting their caseA spokeswoman for the Ombudsman's office said the draft report was still in the hands of the DTI and that publication could not take place until it had been returnedLabour's City spokeswoman Dr Marjorie Mowlam yesterday claimed the delay was part of a Government attempt to avoid further embarrassment over the affairThe possibility that the report would not appear before Christmas would mean another miserable time for investorsHow many more have to die before the report is published and they receive compensationshe saidPAGENew rules mean a set-back for army of casual workersBy Linda LennardUnemployment benefitNEW rules to be introduced from tomorrow will hit many part-time workers receiving unemployment benefitThose who earn £43 a week or more will lose benefit for the whole of that week even if they work only part of it and are unemployed for the remaining daysOnly people who earn £12 or less in any week will escape having their entitlement affected at allAnybody who earns between £12 and £43 in a given week may still be able to qualify for unemployment benefit on the days they are not workingHoweverthey will have to satisfy unemployment benefit officers that part-time work is not their usual patternand they are just doing it while looking for full-time employmentIn generalit has been accepted that people can take on part-time work in this way if it has not been their usual employment patternBut adjudication officers may eventually claim that part-time employment is your normal patternand that you should not be entitled to benefit on the days you don't work because you would not normally expect to be working anywayThis so-called full extent normal rulehas come under considerable criticism from the Court of Appeal downwardsThe new rules coming in tomorrow effectively mean the end of the full extent normal rule for people earning £12 or less in a weekThe government says the changes are interim measures and it intends to reconsider the whole question of the treatment of earnings received by people on unemployment benefitIf you do any part-time work while on unemployment benefit and your earnings do not affect your benefit entitlementyou will still have to meet the rest of the conditions for this benefit on the remaining daysThese include a new stringent actively seeking worktest which was introduced this Octoberas well as showing that you are available for work the rest of the weekAs well as earnings from part-time workother income can affect your entitlement to unemployment benefitIf you are aged 55 or over and have a personal or occupational pension which is more than £35 per weekthe rest will be deducted from your benefitMoney from a redundancy payment should not affect your right to this benefitAlso note that if your partner earns more than £21.40 the adult dependants increase will not be payable for her or himPAGEWater shares underpricedBy Patrick Donovan Industrial CorrespondentMR MICHAEL Howardthe Water Ministeryesterday effectively admitted that water shares have been underpriced as he formally closed the deadline for application amid City predictions that the issue will open at a premium of up to 30 per centAs he waited to pose for photographers drinking a glass of water in a City bankMr Howard said the Government's calculations had been overtaken by the surge in the stock marketMinisters however were not at fault because nobody could tell that the stock market would go up 150 points since we priced the sharesI don't feel any difficulty about thatAs flotation advisers suggested that as many as two million people could have applied for shares after a last-minute surge of applicationshe added that the issue would be a big step towards the Government's goal of increasing the level of share-ownershipMeanwhile Labour's water spokeswomanMs Ann Tayloryesterday asked the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee to investigate the loss suffered by taxpayers as a result of the privatisation of waterShe saidOverall the loss to the taxpayer due to the write off of debt and injection of cash is £1.291billionThe whole of the Government's political campaign to privatise water has been massively subsidised by taxpayersThroughout the year we have all had to pay huge amounts for advertising and for fees to PR firms and City advisersThis has added insult to injury of a privatisation carried out against the wishes of the publicThe industry has been massively undersoldThe price the Government has put on the water industry is a small fraction of the values of the assets shown in the prospectusThe 500,000 acres of land held by the water companies would be prey to massive exploitationPAGE
