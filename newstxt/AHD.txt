River pollutedNearly 300 litres of diesel oil were spilled into a tributary of the River Tamar in Plymouth yesterday after vandals released the fuel from a tank in a timber yardMorning sickness good for mothersBy Roger Highfield Science EditorBOUTS of nausea and vomiting that accompany the first months of pregnancy may be good news for the motheraccording to two new theories on the cause of morning sicknessOne argues that morning sickness helps the mother avoid exposing the developing child to toxins and the other that it is a side-effect of a hormonal power struggle between foetus and motherThe sickness peaks when the foetus is going though a rapid stage of development of limbs and organsmaking it highly sensitive to toxinsMs Margie Profeta research associate at the University of Californiabelieves the accompanying aversion to certain foodstastes and smells may help the mother to avoid more toxic foodsHer findings are about to be published by Oxford University Press in a book called The Adapted MindNatural toxins are contained in most foodsfor instancevegetables use them to fight off pests and bacteria produce them in meatHumans have defences against these toxinsshe saidembryo may be sensitive to small doses a healthy woman could tolerateTo help a pregnant woman avoid certain foodsMs Profet notes thatduring the early stageswomen's sense of smell becomes more acutefood lingers longer in their stomachs and the brain centre that triggers vomiting also becomes more sensitiveThe toxic protection mechanism dovetails with the fact that the pregnancy is three times more likely to miscarry if the mother does not feel sickan observation supported by the second theoryNew laws and more paperwork are forcing some people to stop being foster parentsthe National Foster Care Association said yesterdayNatural parents often had access guaranteed under a court order and foster parents had to be committed to support for parental responsibilitywhich could cause

landBy David BrownAgriculture CorrespondentSCIENTISTS have launched an investigation into the fate of partridges which appear to have been harmed by the increasing amount of land being set aside by farmers and allowed to lie fallowFarmers involved in set-aside have reported a drop in partridges breeding on land which previously enjoyed healthy populations of the birds when it was used to grow wheat and barleyThe reports have puzzled and confounded some expertsThey had expected game-birds to benefit from an increased food supply of insects as farmers stopped spraying pesticides to protect their cereal cropsNow the Game Conservancy Trust at FordingbridgeHampshireis appealing for farmers involved in set-aside schemes to take part in a research project starting this year to assess the impact on the partridge populationUp to 30 farms are being sought initially before scientists choose one which can be subjected to a systematic research programme in which partridges will be fitted with electronic tracking devicesDr Simon Dowellpartridge biologist at the Game Conservancysaid yesterdayWild gamebirds are currently under enormous pressuresSet-aside could be a unique opportunity for improving farmland for wild gamebut unfortunately the present proposals may not be realising their full potential for gamebirds and other wildlifehe addedScientists call for wise use of waterBy Christine McGourtyTechnology CorrespondentMORE water should be recycled and better use made of rainwater to help alleviate shortagessays a report by the Centre for the Exploitation of Science and TechnologyWe've always assumed that the country has enough water but the shortages of the last three or four years have shown this is not the casesaid Dr Neil Johnstonauthor of the reportBecause the quality of water was good and the price relatively lowit had not been used as wisely as it might have beenRestrictions on water use have been imposed this month in areas of the south and east of the countrywhich is experiencing the worst drought this centuryTo meet demands for higher quality and relieve permanent shortages in some partsthe industry should conserve and recycle more watersaid the reportAlthough technology to reduce pollution could make a significant contribution to the problemthe industry showed minimalcommitment to innovationresearch and developmentit saidAnd at £9 million annuallythe Department of Trade and Industry's budget for encouraging the development and uptake of environmental technology by industry to reduce water pollution was too lowMore investment was needed in clean technologyresearch as well as with more collaboration between companiesBut instead of concentrating on treating wasteresearch was needed into fundamentally cleaner processes that conserved water and reduced wasteDespite thisthe quality of Britain's water was as goodif not betterthan that of most other European countriessaid Dr JohnstonBritain is not the dirty man of EuropeThis mythhad created an inferiority complexamong Britain's water suppliers that was discouraging investment in newclean technologyPentland Crown has its chips with retailersBy Our Agriculture CorrespondentA potato variety which can survive Britain's increasingly dry weather better than most has lost its status as a priority crop for farmers because the supermarkets have turned against itRetailers say Pentland Crownthe Scottish-bred variety which increased farmers' yields by up to 20 per cent when it was introduced 30 years agobruises too easily and goes blackFrom next year the potato will be removed from the recommended list of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany in CambridgePentland Crown accounts for only two per cent of the commercial marketbut is still popular with gardeners because of its hardiness and resistance to diseaseWay of the WorldFarming notesBy AUBERON WAUGHMANY will take it as a further surrender to Common Market bureaucracy that an inspectorate will soon be established to regulate the smell of farm manureIn factwith the development of deep-litter hen houses and intensive pig culturesome such controls are necessaryThe smell released by a pig or chicken farm is indescribableand can affect 10 square miles of countryside aroundOne may doubt whether modern farming has any useful purpose nowadays when everybody is on a dietIt mostly seems to involve producing food for animals to eatwhose excrement is then collected to assist the growth of more food for animalsSmall children can sometimes be persuaded to eat cow cake in the same way that old people will eat cat foodbut the chief result of all this farming was to produce huge food mountains which we could then refuse to give to the Third Worldor to the socialists of Eastern Europein order to teach them the error of their waysHoweverthere is a new plan to turn land over to wind farmingIt involves nothing more than putting up 80-foot masts all over the landA 1,500-acre grouse moor will generate enough electricity in this way to power a town of 6,000 peopleThe farmer receives a rent of £15,000 a year and is relieved of the need to do any work for itAll the food we need will be provided by monster underground funguses producing a regular crop of mushrooms without human assistanceThe masts may seem unsightly to those unused to thembut I am sure it is simply a matter of getting accustomedCows were thought very unsightly when they were first introducedNowadayswe all swoon with pleasure at the sight of a cowIn The CountryOutdoorsIt's mink that gets the blame Michael J. Woods feels that the declining vole faces more than one enemyBy MICHAEL J WOODSTHE PLOP of the fleeing water volefollowed by an underwater smoke-screen of siltwas once a familiar indicator of the presence of these mammals on our waterwaysNo longerAccording to Rob Strachanwho has recently completed the field work for a Water Vole Survey of Britainfunded by the Vincent Wildlife Trustonly 30 per cent of the sites where water voles were found before 1939 still have them todayAt the turn of the centuryKenneth Grahame could confidently give the water vole a leading role in The Wind in the Willowsalmost everyone knew this small rodent from almost daily acquaintanceEven 20 years agoRob Strachan recallsthe vole was much more commonThere were rivers he visited as a child where he could sit and watch water voles every dayHe cannot do that nowThe water vole is about the same size as a brown ratbut with blunter featuressmaller earsa furry tail and a more gingery coatAlmost entirely herbivorousit excavates a maze of galleries in the banks of waterways and pondsThere are entrances at different levelsincluding some below the normal waterline for use in emergenciesIn times of flood the water vole moves upwards through its various tunnels untilin extreme conditionsit is forced to leave its underground refuge and resort to thick cover on the bankThe vole prefers slow-moving riverspools and marshy areas with some deep water whose level changes littlebut there have been great changes to Britain's wetlands during the past 40 years as a result of agricultural intensificationModern farming techniques have diminished the number and quality of the wetlands which remainDuring the same periodthe North American mink has escaped or been released from fur farms and has spread almost nationwideGordon Woodroffea zoologist who has studied the water voles of the North York Moorsdoes not consider that the mink is the total rogue it is held out to be in some quartersbut it certainly appears to have caused the vole's extinction on the MoorsHe actually witnessed the death of the last animal in his study groupIt was wearing a radio collar at the timeAs Woodroffe recountshe was watching it from the opposite bank of the narrow stream and was so close that he was worried the vole would hear his receiver pulsing loudlyAs he watcheda mink pounced on the vole andalthough the vole dived from the bank for safety at the last minutethe mink had grabbed it almost before it hit the waterDr Johnny Birks has been studying mink for many years and he admits with some reluctance that this extremely successful marten may have contributed to the vole's declineThe North American minkhe sayshas fitted into the niche which would otherwise have been occupied by the European mink had it ever reached BritainHe is convincedthoughthat the water vole would have withstood the pressures on it brought about by the mink had the vole's habitat been less degradedHe is not surprised by accounts like Gordon Woodroffe'sfor upland streams are certainly not prime areas for the water voleBut where the habitat remains of high quality Tregaron Bog in Wales or Stodmarsh in Kent mink and voles co-exist in good numbersStrachan and Birks agree that water vole numbers were in significant decline before the arrival of the mink which can overcome the water vole's traditional defences by following it into water and evenin the case of smaller minkinto its tunnelsCircumstantial evidence suggests that this animal is a significant problem for water volesStrachan's work shows thatwhen field signs of mink increasethose of voles diminishIt is always easy to blame an individual speciessays BirksAn alien carnivore is the perfect answerBut we have to look past the mink to find the underlying reasons for the vole's disappearanceWithout doing sowe could miss vital factors of detriment both to water voles and other wetland wildlifeRob Strachan stresses that the water vole survey is the first of its kindIt is only the baseline from which a repeat exercise can be carried outin seven to 10 years' timeMeanwhileStrachan views the water vole as an indicator of wetland habitat qualityand he looks forward with little optimismThe volehe saysappears to be coming perilously close to being endangeredand this means that Britain's wetlands are going the same wayIn The CountryFARMER'S DIARYOut of townout of mindBy R W F POOLEFOX DUMPING is the latest bit of animal welfarestupidityThe fox has taken to urban life with great successFoxes are great scavengers and the overflowing dustbins of our deprived society provide excellent pickingsThe thriving vulpine population is seen by various urban authorities as a problemFor some time there have been rumours that the urbs have been solving the problem by having their foxes caught and surreptitiously turned loose in remote rural areasA report in the Liverpool Daily Post quoted a Birmingham City Council member as saying that it was necessary to control fox numbers on public health groundsFoxes were humanely snareda contradiction in termsand handed over to various voluntary welfare organisationsthey were then transported we know not whereThe council's environmental health department subsequently stated that the trapping and transport of foxes within the city is not known to this departmentIt is obvious or should bethat an influx of hungrysemi-strangled and homeless urban foxes into a rural area will make a thorough mess of the local ecosystemThis is especially so in the remote sheep-farming areas of Waleswhich seem to be particularly favoured as fox-dumping groundsIt must be stressed thatso farthe evidence of sneaky fox transportation is circumstantialIt includes hunts coming across groups of foxes sitting about in fields hardly typical vulpine behaviourThese foxes appear disorientated and pay no heed to the houndswhich makes their learning curve a short oneThere are other reports of foxes collecting round farmhouses to scavengeThese foxes seem to have no instinct to hunt and have little fear of manFarmers do not welcome these incomersInspection of the corpses has shown that the animals were in poor conditionSome of the wretched creatures had been castratedno doubt for welfare and public health reasonsEvidence seemed to harden somewhat when a Glamorgan farmer went to the aid of a ditched van one dark nightThe grateful driver told the farmer that his cargo consisted of 47 foxes which were being transported from the Midlands to be let loose in Wales by order of the RSPCAAn RSPCA spokesman denied all knowledge of the vanits mission and its contentsAsked if he knew anything of fox dumpinghe saidObviously we are nothing to do with itThis is a seedy businessWell-meaning ignorance is one of the biggest causes of animal suffering in this countryHeaven preserve us all from welfarenaticsAN OLD gentleman once told me that the two things that caused the greatest rural rows were the Church and fox-huntingIt has to be said that fox-hunters are not the least quarrelsome of Her Majesty's subjectsbut they are as mewlingpukingbairns when compared with church personsI well remember attending an ecumenical garden partyminding my own business and trying to juggle a cup of weak tea and a sinewy rock cakeDown the garden came our C of E rectorAt the bottom of the garden his brethren of the cloth were submitting his character to a sustained and vicious maulingSo much for Christian charityI thoughtbut then it does not do to mix God and religionThis point was well illustrated in a Church row that once broke over the head of a certain manThis man lived a reasonably blameless life on an isolated steading on the boundary of two parishesFor some reason both the adjoining clerical incumbents wished to call his soul their ownor it may have been his jumble that they wantedThey bombarded him with letterseach cleric pointing out the justice of his claims and listing the iniquities of his brother in ChristOur man got fed up with this nonsenseCareful study of the map showed him that his house was in neither parishit was within the boundary of a parish in which he and a lot of black-face sheep were the only inhabitantsHe declared UDIIn a letter to the bishop he stated that he intended to appoint himself lay reader for the parishto stick to the King James Bible and the Cranmer Prayer Book and to preach to himself and the sheepHigh Tory sermonsso please would His Grace tell the neighbours to go stick their heads in their fontsThere was no reply from the bishopbut he didn't hear another squeak from the turbulent priests eitherIn The CountryNATURE NOTEBy Robert BurtonTHE STOCK dove must be one of our most overlooked larger birdsIt is easily dismissed as just another pigeonbut it is smaller than its close relative the wood-pigeonThe two species sometimes associate in the fieldsand their behaviour is similarso a special watch must be kept for the stock doveIt lacks the wood-pigeon's white bars on wings and neckLookinsteadfor black edges to otherwise pale wings when the stock dove is in flightIts gruff double coowith the second note clipped and emphaticalso reveals its identityAt one time confined to the south and east of the countrythe stock dove spread as arable farming expanded in the 19th centurybut the introduction of organo-chlorine seed dressings in the 1960s was a disasterThe stock dove almost disappeared from some areasbutlike other species that were hard-hit at the same timeit has since made a good recoveryIt is nowhoweverless abundant in intensively farmed countryside because herbicides have robbed it of weed seeds to eatand the old farm buildings and ancient hollow trees where it nested have frequently disappearedThere is some mystery about the origin of the stock dove's namebut it probably came from the habit of nesting in the stocks or trunks of treesAlthough tree holes are the most common nesting placestock doves have been found nesting in rabbit holes and they occasionally take over the abandoned nests of wood-pigeonsIn The CountryThe boys from the black stuff Sara Jackson sees how charcoal burners are surviving as a symbol of traditional methods of woodland conservationBy SARA JACKSONIN A WOOD in South OckendonEssexon the very outskirts of Londontwo brothers spend their days cutting dead timberloading it into a steel kiln and setting it alightThe brothersRay and Alan Mitchellare charcoal burnersTheirs was once a common line of businessbut now there are only about two dozen professional burners left in the countryRay and Alanwho took it up only two years agouse a method practised for 150 yearsAs ex-plumbers they are unlikely candidates for resurrecting ancient woodland traditionsyet they are part of a growing drive to do just thatThe Mitchells set up Eden Woodland Products in 1990after the builder they were contracted to went bust in the 1988 crashThey wanted a new start and found one in the form of nearby Hangman's Woodowned by the Marley Paving companyAfter the storm of 1987 it was just devastatedsays AlanWe thoughtthere's got to be something we can do with all that woodNow they produce barbecue charcoal from itIt's a growing marketIn 1987 Britain imported 20,000 tonsand by 199090,000 tonsHangman's Wood suffered so severely from the gales becauselike much of our woodlandsit had been neglected for decadesYet until the 1950s most had been managed as coppice since Norman timesIt provided grazing landtimberfruits and fuelwhile remaining an undamaged wildlife habitatCoppice management involves dividing a woodland into compartmentsor coupeswhich are cut on a rotation of five to 25 yearsThe small underwoodtrees or coppiceare chopped back to stumpsproducing shoots cut for sticks and brushwoodA portion of standardssuch as oaksare cut for timber at the same timebut saplings are left to replace themGrazing should be prohibited in the newly-cut coupe for about seven years to allow the establishment of new seedlingsThe wood therefore is constantly regeneratedyet also yields a steady supply of timber and grazingThe Mitchells were granted permission to burn charcoal from coppiced timber at Hangman's Wood if they returned it to this state of managementThey have cleared their first coupe andaided by the Woodland Grant Schemewill replant next springreplacing weed species such as sycamore with oakcherry and ashLast springbluebells grew in this cleared area for the first time in yearsAlan saidThey couldn't get through the undergrowth beforeThe Mitchells coppice their woodland to earn a livingBut other organisations supporting traditional woodland management have more far-reaching objectives in mindThe idea is a simple onebegin working our dwindling woodland again and we could be providing the best argument for preserving itThese organisations include the Woodland Trustand Thames Chasethe Community Forest in whose area Hangman's Wood liesCommunity Forestsfunded by the Forestry and Countryside Commissionswere set up in 1990 on the outskirts of major citiesThey encourage landowners and businesses to plant on their own landBut the woodland they create will be managed as it was in the pastThe principle behind this effort to resurrect the countryside is ecnomic viabilityLandowners are more likely to plant and maintain woodland if it provides incomeSo farlocal companies have been the most responsiveRhone Poulenc at Dagenham is financing the planting of 2,000 trees at nearby Eastbrook SchoolTwo thousand trees on a two-acre site is a lot too many to survive as fully mature trees but this excessive planting keeps the programme economically viableAfter 20 years or so thinning can beginthe excess trees are used as timber and the remainder form a naturally spaced woodlandBut it is the farmers who are the hardest to interest although all planting is grant-aidedFor companies the benefits of co-operation are clearIt is good public relationsThe mineral companies especially will find future planning permission easier if they put the land back to good usesays Max Hislopa community foresterHislop believes thatas crop subsidies fallfarmers will see woodland creation as a practical alternativeMeanwhilerecession hasn't helped the programmeWe'd have so much more plantedsays HislopBut when companies are laying off workersthey can't then be seen to donate money to charityIt's very difficultIt's very difficult too for Ray and Alan MitchellThe UK imports 95 per cent of its charcoalmostly from rainforestsCharcoal consumption from these sources is not environmentally acceptableBut the price isTo produce their charcoalRay and Alan cut the woodload the kilnempty it into sacks after the burn and then re-bag it for retail saleThey also drive around trying to market itLast year their turnover was £6,000None of this was profitThey subsidise their income by doing odd jobs for Marley PavingWe can't compete on price with Third World countriessays Raybecause it's so labour-intensiveWholesalers buy imported charcoal at around £1.80 a bagadd 130 per cent and sell it onWe sell these bags at £2.49 and have added only 15 per cent profitBut the brothers have faith in the product's futureThey believe it will sell becauseif consumers are boycotting tropical hardwoods stocked by DIY storesthere is no reason why they should condone burning them on the barbecueAs a sign of their optimism they have begun producing artist's charcoal from willowThe concept behind planting and working woodland deserves to survive current hardshipsAfter allif the Normans hadn't thought long-term and picked up their trowels 1,000 years agothere would be no New Forest todayIt is ironic that it has taken until the dawn of the 21st century to realise that the best methods of utilising and hence preserving our woodlands are those employed a millennium ago
