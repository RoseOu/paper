A Country DiaryNORTHUMBERLANDWhen we saw our first immigrant golden-eye bobbing on the waters of Bolam Lake in the early months of each yearwe always took it as the first sign of springBlack and white in appearancethe male golden-eye can be distinguished from the less strikingly marked male tufted duck by its lack of drooping crest and an ostentatious white patch behind the billBucephala clangulasounds noisy butin factthe golden-eye is a silent duck compared with the mallard and wigeonBolam Lake has now been designated a Country Park and has a warden to protect itI often see foxesroe deer and red squirrels in the conifer plantation thereSurely a tribute to sensitive managementDavid Noble-Rollinof the Natural History Society of Northumbria led a party to Bolam last weekMist hung over the water and the huge concourse of duck swam and ducked and preenedI picked out two golden-eye amongst teal and wigeonDavid told us that swan pattern of movement was currently being monitored in the north-eastso he was trying to read the leg bands through his glassAll on the same alder tree we saw coal titsgold crestsmarsh willow tits and long-tailed tits and I learnt to distinguish the

Border regionThe swan was once a highly regarded delicacy on the Christmas tableOrnithologists gave the bird a Christian foundation and believed that the first mute swans were brought to Great Britain by the Crusaders from Cyprus in 1192This theory was contradicted following the discovery of swan bones in CambridgeshireNorfolkSuffolk and EssexVERONICA HEATHPresents of mind Gifts say an awful lot

for generations to guarantee a Christmas kissmistletoe long a traditional part of the festive season is dying outThis yearthe white-berried twigs with their narrowleathery leaves are harder to come by and more expensive than everAnd if you do buy a couple of tiny sprigs for £1 it's likely to be French mistletoeThe decline in home-grown mistletoe is the direct result of the continuing loss of yet another typical feature of the English countrysidethe apple orchardMistletoe grows on old tree branchespreferring the rugged bark of apple trees but also poplarslimes andoccasionallyhedgerow hawthornsConifers it detestsApple trees are its bread and butter in Britain but mistletoe clearly has no meal ticketIn 1957England had 26,000 hectares of dessert apple orchardsNowfewer than 14,000 hectares remainMany of these survivors are not traditional tree orchards at allbut bush varieties on which mistletoe is incapable of gaining a footholdCider and culinary apple orchards have gone the same wayall helped along until a few years ago by government grants to grub up the old trees and replace them with easy to sprayprune and pick bush typesA partial parasitemistletoe relies on birds such as thrushes eating its oily berries and dropping the seeds out at the other end on to the branches of trees where they perchIf it ends up in a bark crevicethe seed may germinate and penetrate the treeThe growing plant partly relies on the host tree for nutrients but it also makes its own by the usual photosynthesisEvergreen mistletoe stems can be a metre or so longMistletoe was once quite common as were apple tree orchards in eastern and southern Englandthe south-west and parts of the MidlandsIt has always been absent from Scotland and IrelandIts decline explains why the wholesale

making big inroadsCovent Garden deals in itas do many provincial wholesale marketsBut nurseryman Peter Summers of Teme Valley Nursery at Tenbury reckons that the English variety is far superiorThe French mistletoe exactly the same speciesis cut earlier and dries out more because of the distance it comeshe saysThat is why the berries drop off soonerThe Frenchthoughhave retained far more of their
