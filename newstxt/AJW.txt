MeditationWeep for the worldBy BISHOP GEORGE APPLETONTOMORROWthe day of the London MarathonChristians will think also of another crowded journey into the capital citythe last time that Jesus went up to Jerusalem with pilgrims from Galilee to take part in the Passover festivalwhich commemorated the escape of their ancestors from slavery in building the pyramids of EgyptIt seems that Jesus himself organised this last journeyfrom the borrowing of a donkey and its foal to the challenging protest against what was going on in the Temple courtsRiding the donkeya humble domestic animalrather than a horsethe symbol of importance and powerthe meaning was made even more obvious by the little foal trotting happily beside its motherPreceding were the 12 apostlesto signify the 12 tribesThe approach to the city with the scriptural shouts evidently attracted the attention of the Passover crowds already in the cityas well as the disapproval of the religious leaders of the nationto whose critical remarks Jesus retortedIf these should be silent even the huge stones of the Temple walls would cry outThe route taken into the city was not the shortest way from Bethanybut over the shoulder of the Mount of OlivesWhen they reached the first sight of the cityit is recordedJesus weptexclaimingOJerusalemJerusalemhow often would I have gathered thy childrenas a hen gathers her chicks under her wingsand ye would notJesus in his Risen Being will still be grieved by all the tragediesinjustices and selfish motivations of the worldCardinal Basil Hume is untiring in his reminder that 12 million children under five die every year from hunger and diseaseWe are told that the global military expenditure every year amounts to Â£235,000 milliontwice as much as the nations spend on healthand half as much again as they spend on educationOne is dismayed to learn that 3,000 million do not get pure drinking water and so are too weak to undertake the work necessary to grow more foodOne last shattering figure is that 700 million adults cannot read or write and 250 million children under 14 do not attend schoolTo remedy these distressing conditionsUNO has calculated that if every countryrich and poorgave 0.7 per cent of its gross national productworld poverty could be banished in a generationHaving lived for 20 years in a country in which the dominant religion was BuddhismI thank God for the Buddha's inspirationNow may every living beingyoung or oldweak or strongliving near or farknown or unknownliving or departed or yet unbornmay every living thing be full of blissWay of the WorldKeep them movingBy AUBERON WAUGHA DESPATCH from Rome in Thursday's newspaper seemed to tell us that the Pope has been urging sex education for priestsWe can only hope that the message was garbled in transmissionor possibly in translation from the Italian a much more difficult language than many seem prepared to believeThe message is apparently contained in a 220-page apostolic exhortation to the clergymost of which is uncontentiouspriests must be ascetic and chaste as well as celibatetaking a keen and benevolent interest in the poor and in sinnerswho are the poor in spiritBut is it really a good idea that students should be taught about sex in seminariesThe idea seems to be that if priests are given a properly informed sexual educationthis will prevent their love of chastitybeing displaced by the temptations of the fleshbut I see no reason why it should have this effectThe Pope's theory is that priests should be specially educated to arm themselves with more than supernatural meansagainst possible temptationWhat can he meanMany doctors in the post-Freudian age believe that nothing but harm can come from sex educationOne has only to look at the United Stateswhere they take sex education very seriously but seem to have got everything wrongwith the most appalling results to the nation's healthIt can be argued that American children are not always very intelligent or easy to teachwith catastrophically short attention spansbut one can see the beginnings of a sad muddle even in Englandwith the publication of a homosexual prayer book giving instructions for a coming outliturgy next door to prayers for those who already suffer from the American diseaseI feel the Pope should draw his clergy's attention instead to these new things called Buzzboards motorised two-wheel scooters on which the driver travels upright at a dignified speed of 20 mphThere can be no question of indulging in sexual impropriety while driving a BuzzboardAn enthusiast points out that its real attraction is that it is funWhen you ride it you have a permanent smile on your faceExactly what a celibate clergy needs
