FashionFablecable and fishermen's yarnsVinny Lee on warm and woolly traditional chunky sweatersBy VINNY LEESAILING around the coast of England searching for shoals of fishGerorge Trowarka Cornish fisherman born in 1877must have visited dozens of ports and harboursAt each stop he noted down the shapes and stitch work of other traditional working men's jumpersFrom the Morecambe Cockler's Pullover to the Romney Marsh Smock and Norfolk Fenman's Weskit to Thames Docker's Jacketeach intricate knit and pearl motif was documentedTrowark himself would most likely have been found under the thick cable-knit cover of his Cornish Knit FrockTrowark joined his father Jelbert and brother Jago on the fishing boats of Newlyn and in time learnt to knit a craft popular among fishermen of the day as a way of passing time on long voyagesAlthough a skilled fishermanGeorge Trowark became renowned as a knitter and over many years and many voyages he accumulated detailed notes of designs and patternsThese notes have provided knitwear designer Martin Storey with much of the information and inspiration for his new George Trowark rangea new collection of chunky man-sized jumpersThe 12 sweater designs in the new Trowark collection are hand-knitted or quality machine-knitted and hand finished in cottonlinen or wool yarnsColours are muted blackblue or natural the dyed colours mature and look softer with wearIndigo-dyed blue jumpers are stonewashed to give a worn lookbut the stonewashing also creates an interesting highlight effect on the raised knitted detailsThe dye tends to stay darker around the patterns and creates an outline on the stitch-workincluding the discreet GT initials worked into the hems of the jumpersTrowark style is largeenveloping and extremely cosy with an almost indestructible quality one five-year-old jumper seen by The Independent is only just beginning to look broken inafter years of frequent machine washing and hard wearOnly medium and large sizes are made in these real men's jumpersbut the large linen shirt makes a wonderful tunic for a woman of average size and will probably keep her knees nice and warmThe designerMartin Storeyof

Jonathan GlanceyBy JONATHAN GLANCEYMODERN tramsas most continental Europeans knowneither shake nor rattlenor do they rollSleeksolidly builtgentle on the environmentthey are often an ideal form of city transportThey also exert a fascination very much of their own as they slither round circuses and brush through old city gatesflashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks on winter nightsSingle-cararticulated or double-deckertrams are one of the most reliable and enduring forms of public transport inventedThe orange-liveried 1500series trams in Milanfor exampledate from 1927Eventually they will be replacedbut more than 60 years on they run with the rhythmic reliability of a Swiss watchThey are as much a part of Milan as La Scala or the Galleria Vittore EmmanueleLast month it was announced that Britain will get its first new-wave trams in 1991Destined to run in Manchesterthey will relieve traffic congestion and help to reduce the levels of carbon monoxide in the city centreoutlying suburbs and satellite towns of BuryAltrinchamSalfordOldham and RochdaleIn Britainwith the main exception of Blackpool not forgetting the single-deckers of the Isle of Man and Llandudnotrams had been largely relegated to the history booksOtherwisethe best place to see working trams has been the tram museum at Crich in Derbyshire or else in old British Transport Commission films and Ealing comediesTrams disappeared from most British cities in the 1950sLondon's venerable red and cream double-deckers rumbled along the Thames embankment for the last time in 1952Somehow the image of the tallthinmournful double-deck tram with its wooden bodyslatted wooden seats and growling electric motor has stuck in the British mindTramsit was believed until surprisingly recentlyare old-fashionedThey had something to do with fish and chips wrapped in newspapermen in hatsNational Health specssmog and powdered eggThey held up the bright new diesel buses andeven worseblocked the progress of private motorists in bulbous Austins and lumpen Humbers in canyon-like city thoroughfaresThey picked up power from a spider's web of unsightly overhead wiresThey were inflexible in operationdraughtyand mobile reminders of TB epidemics with the enamelled Do Not Spitsigns screwed to their bulkheadsBut the modern tram could hardly be more differentIt plays a key role in keeping city streets on the move and is even the object of the best modern designers' desireIn Milanfor examplethe commission to design the new generation of Jumbotramswhich went into service in 1979was one that leading Italian architects and designers fought overAfter allthe Jumboa handsome and imposing articulated unit designed by architectengineer and critic Klaus Giovanni Koenigwill be seen on the streets of Milan for the next half-centurySpotlessly clean and popularthe Jumbo is a long-term advertisement for Koenig's design skillsThe modern tram is a green machineAssuming the power station at the end of the line burns cleanlythe tram is virtually pollution freeStanding at traffic lights a Koenig-designed Jumbo issave for the chatter insidecompletely silentThe overhead wires are so slight that you have to look hard to see themPowers of acceleration and braking are remarkablethe latter far greater than any carBut sadlythere is no indication that the GMA consortium which will designoperate and maintain the first of the new generation British trams in Manchester will share the looks of their Milanese counterpartsArtists' impressions show a tram that has more in common with the flat-facedcharacterless light trains of the toy-like Docklands Light RailwayThere is still time for GMA GECMowlemAmec and Greater Manchester Busesto consider employing an inspired architect or industrial designerAfter allMancunians and visitors to the Manchester conurbation are going to have to look at these mechanical millipedes for well into the twenty-first centuryNow that buses are no longer designed to enhance the streets they serveManchester has a chance to make a fresh start with its tramsManchester is not aloneOther British townsCroydon and Southampton among themare also considering modern tramwaysThese are all referred to as supertramnetworksthe implication being that the new-generation tram is an altogether more dynamic form of transport than its pre-war predecessorsWhat it really means is that the new trams are a hybrid between street car and lightweight suburban trainAlthough they will slip through the city centre serving the essential parts shopping mallsleisure centrestheme parksamusement arcades and museums the Manchester supertrams will also head out of town on a mix of reserved track and existing railway linesThe supertram isin effecta low-cost replacement for British Rail's ageing fleet of suburban diesel multiple-unit trainsthose rasping diesels which change gear to the accompaniment of voluminous clouds of acrid black exhaust fumes and the blessing of train spottersThey will perform some of the same functionsbut they will not be an exact replacement for traditional tramsAnd although the supertram concept will spread through major cities during the next decadeBlackpool will still be alone in its use of traditional double-deckersKeeping the fabric of historyTaking care of old clothes requires more than just

knits as he travelswrites Vinny LeeI knitted my way across the Atlantiche revealsOn a flight to New York I sat in my Club Class seat and knitted almost continuously for the seven-hour flightThe air hostesses inquired what I was making and a man passing in the aisle quite genuinely complimented me on my workMr Young started knitting 10 years agoA girlfriend made me a wonderful bigbright red jumper which I liked so much that I asked her to knit me anotherHer reply was knit it yourselfso I didShe taught me the basicscasting-onhow to knit and pearland I set to workTravelling on the train to and from Folkestone and London over a period of months I knitted a bright pink jumperSitting in the compartment in my dark city suitworking away at the bright knitting caused a lot of second glances from passers-bybut usually ensured I kept the compartment to myselfIn the beginning knitting was a challengenow it is therapeutic and satisfyingI have reached a stage where I can watch televisionas long as the programme doesn't require too much attentionand knit at the same timeMr Young does not have much time for fancy patterns with three dimensional fiddlybitsHe likes to knit quicklyI use chunky wool and big needles so that results are achieved rapidlyI love bright colours and knit most of the jumpers as presentsFriends like to be given something you've taken time and trouble to make for themApart from jumpers he has knitted a jacketscarvesa three-foot banana which became a cushionand numerous tiesMoss stitch is best for ties otherwise they tend to curl up at the edges and look
