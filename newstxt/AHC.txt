Letter to the EditorOriginal dishSIR In 1813 Sir Thomas Bernard published a pamphletAn Account of a Supply of Fish for the Manufacturing Poorwhich proposed to ameliorate the poverty among working people in London by increasing the supply of fishA Fish Association was duly set up under the chairmanship of the Duke of KentIn one report the association described the success of the fish industry in Penzancementioning that the shortage of corn lead to its replacement by increased potato plantingSo there you have itfish and chips were a West Country inventionBILL WEST ExeterDevonLeading ArticleHorses for coursesFOR THE thoughtful punterwith cash in handat least two openings present themselves this morning the Grand National and next week's General ElectionWeighing his chancesthe punter will naturally examine respective oddsThere is nothing at Aintree much shorter than 6 to 1whereas the two main parties in the General Election are offered on narrower termsThere are also minor differences of which to take accountA gamblertaking a sudden fancy to Mr Kinnock and planting £25,000 on Labour not a course we recommend will be felt instantly in this modest marketand shift the odds overnightHe would make less stir in the larger Aintree poolThere remains one major difference between the punter's chances withsayCool Ground or Twin Oaks at Aintree and his prospects with Messrs MajorKinnock or AshdownNo one in their senses puts money on a horse other than in the hope of winning moneyThe political punterthoughbets more with his heart than his headIf he is the sort of man who wears a red rose in his buttonhole every dayloyalty will drive him to have a bet on Mr Kinnockregardless of his chancesYesterday we observed that Mr Jeffrey Archer whose idea of canvassing for the Tory Party has revived the lost art of burlesquehad bet £10 that the Tories will win with a majority of 27 seatsIt illustrates our point beautifullyMr Archer publicly signals his confidence in the

STAFFORDWILLSFORDwhose careful preparation this season has been timed to bring him to his peak on Martell Grand National daywill carry maximum stable confidence at Liverpool todayEndless debate and speculation about the likely state of the going will count for nothing when the 40 runners line up at 4pmThe general consensus is that few horses should be inconvenienced by the groundOnly 11 of the 40 horses are inside the scope of the true handicapbut Willsfordwho carries just 3lb more than his proper markmust be considered well treatedHe won the 1990 Midlands Grand Nationalfrom a handicap mark

hurdlesin the intervening 23 monthsThroughout his careerWillsford has specialised in spectacular performancesHe won two novice hurdles by wide margins in his first campaignand then two novice chases the following winter before running away with the County Hurdle at Cheltenham from a field which included the smart mare Travel MysteryApart from his Midlands Grand National triumph in 1990 he also gained a verdict over Norton's Coin at Cheltenham two months before that horse's Gold Cup success and would have been an easy winner of the Greenall Whitley Chase but for falling when clear at the last fenceThat remains his only falland it was more a case of a slip one stride after landing than a regulation fallThe Pitman yardwhich has done so well in this race one winnera second and two thirds since 1983 believe he will adapt to the unique Aintree fencesand as long as he copes with the first fewthey feel he must go closeMy opinion is thatas long as Willsford is among the leaders coming to the last two fences and six furlongshis speed will be a potent weaponespecially as he carries the minimum weightVictory for Willsford would give Michael BowlbyMrs Pitman's brother-in-lawhis biggest

advanceeverything is set for an enthralling Boxing Day confrontation in the King George VI Rank Chase at Kempton ParkTrainers Nicky Henderson and Josh Gifford both named that race as their target and neither horse will run again this seasonDunwoody's day started badly with a fall on Gambling Royal andsetting out on Remittance Man for the Mumm Melling Chasehe must have had the fences more than usually in mindUncle Ernie's fall at the first was hardly reassuring but Remittance Man soon put his rider's mind at restA proud Henderson saidFast or slowhe can do it either wayBut the faster they go the betterSure enoughundisturbed by a slow early gallopRemittance Man's jumping warmed up from good to brilliantHe must be a dreadful horse to chaseand Pat's Jester and Edberg were left

Jodamithe abiding memory of this race will be the ride Peter Scudamore gave Run For FreeThe blunder he survived at the 15th fence would have sent 99 men out of 100 into orbitThenrescued by the invisible safety net of his own strength and balancethis amazing champion drove Run For Free back into contentionTheir distant third was worth a dozen victoriesThe equally indomitable Dunwoody had his second fall of the day on Calabrese and completed a painful hat-trick when King of The Lot unseated him in the Tote 7th Handicap Chasewon by Howe StreetIn the circumstancesDunwoodywho escaped with nothing worse than bruiseswas performing a miracle of tolerant good sense when he suggested that the Mildmay fences should perhaps be a bit more sloped and not quite so square at the topAs Josh Gifford also pointed outone root of the problem is that the Mildmay course hasuntil nowbeen used only once a yearIt is hardly surprising that horsesaccustomed to brushing through well-worn fencesshould find these brand-newhard-packed ones uninvitingJohn Parrettthe clerk of the coursestill regards his fences as perfectly fairand confirms thatbuilt to strict Jockey Club standardsthey were

Argumentand his rider Andrew SansomeEven Scudamore would have been proud of Sansome's recovery at the ChairThe Grand NationalMy best chance yetBy Peter ScudamoreAN OUNCE of luck is always welcome in racing and I have to admit that I feel the most fortunate man around this morning having been asked to ride Docklands Express in the Grand National a race I have never wonThe fact is that if I hadn't taken part in the BBC television previews of the big event I would probably be riding my old friend Bonanza BoyThe whole story is that I was asked to ride Docklands ExpressCool GroundAuntie Dot and Bonanza Boy in home gallops for the television cameras and then to compare the quartetNot many other jockeys are so luckyEven leading up to the filmingthere were doubts about Adrian Maguire riding Cool Ground as he had a previous tie to OmertaAlsoAnthony Toryregular jockey for Docklands Expresshad been having trouble with his shoulder for a whileand Mark Perrettanother of the horse's regular ridershad been claimed for RubikaI can remember vividly the whole episode with Docklands ExpressIt was our first morning of filming and when I rode the horse I really liked himHe felt greathe worked with class and he had the right attitudeI thoughtThis is the oneWhen we had finished filming I said to Kim Baileythe trainerIf you ever need somebody to ride this little horseI would love to be consideredHow quickly things change in racing and change they certainly have this weekWhen I rode Docklands Express in his workI was thinking I would probably be having my fourth Grand National ride on Bonanza Boy then there were reports of rain across the countrywhich made me feel quite satisfied to be on Martin Pipe's runnerHe knows his way around the course andwith any luckI felt the ground would come up softHoweverwhen I got to Liverpool on Thursday and saw the state of the groundinstead of thinking about such horses as Laura's BeauRubika and Cool Ground as the major chancessuddenly it was the good-ground types such as Docklands Express who re-entered calculationsWhen I sat on Cool Ground I was impressed with him tooHe had not been prepared for Cheltenham the same as some horses arebecause there had been a last-minute change of plan for him and he would not have been really galloped hardRacing against other horses is an entirely different thing from riding horses in their work and it is not always the ones who work the best that are necessarily the winnersIn factCool Ground worked with Romany King and Sirrah Jayand they actually worked better than he didAlthoughwhen we came back from one of our cantersCool Ground was very brightHe really marched in and he pulled 20 lengths ahead of the other two just walkingHe is in great formThe other interesting runner I rode was Auntie Dotparticularly as she has the advantage of being schooled over a National-type fence on her trainer John Webber's gallopsWith the TV cameras thereJulian Wilson asked Mr Webber if I could pop her over the fenceI joked about a jockey needing a large port and brandy to do that sort of thing cold in the morning and besides we might be risking the horse suffering a mishapYou let me worry about any injuries my horse might suffersaid Mr WebberI thought to myselfOh nobut Auntie Dot went into the fence and was brilliant at itOriginally I thought the ground might be too soft for hermaking it a real test of staminaand we know that she only just gets the tripBut as the ground is a lot quicker nowshe must have a bright chanceBonanza Boyone of my old favouriteshas been a remarkable horse over the years and I am a touch sad in having to desert him for a horse I consider to have a better chanceBut Martin Pipe is a realistand never for a moment did he stand in my way when the Docklands Express ride came upBonanza Boy will have blinkers back on and this may assist himHe knows the place so well and is a real hardy customerI suppose I am in a good position to weigh up the prospects of the major contenders in today's raceat leastand I have no hesitation in declaring my delight at being on Docklands ExpressOn the Form Book and after riding himI consider Docklands Express to be a first-class prospectTwin Oaks looks a great type for the fences and may be the hardest to beat but I also have a healthy respect for Cool Ground and Brown WindsorThis racing game can be funnycan't itI set off as a television test pilot and have ended up with my best-ever chance of winning the raceThe Grand NationalDavies hoping to go farBy John OakseyWISHFUL thinking is a notoriously expensive way of choosing winnersSo the fact thatlike all Sir Hugh Dundas's friends and admirersI would love to see Ghofar win him today's Martell Grand National does notunfortunatelymean it will happenBut never mindThere have been miracles at Aintree beforeand Ghofarfit and freshmay just have a better each-way chance than his odds of 33–1 suggestA nine-year-oldhe is the ideal age and will be ridden by Hywel Davies for the first time since they won the 1989 Hennessy Cognac Gold CupGhofar has a good deal in common with Last Suspectthe 50–1 shot on whom this sagacious Welshman won the 1985 Grand NationalBoth horses are thinkersin the sense that a lot depends on what goes on inside their headsLast Suspectan inveterate tail-swisheroften used to sulk and pull himself up if he did not like the way a race seemed to be goingBut having talked his reluctant owner and trainer into runningDavies proceeded to kid and cajole their unpredictable 11-year-old into running the race of his lifeHe achieved a comparable masterpiece on Ghofar in the 1989 Hennessy their only previous effort togetherand plans another this afternoonIt is all a question of mind over matterDavies says just like Last SuspectI shall want a good start and be up there over the first few fencesYou have to motivate horses like thesebut once I've got Ghofar's blood upwe should be cruisingMy only worry is thatwith the ground drying upthey might go so fast that he gets disheartenedBut I'm really looking forward to the rideFor Ghofar's ownersmost of the motivationhas come from the horse's trainer David ElsworthNeither Hugh Dundashis wife who is my sisternor their American partner Don Tafner were at all keen to run in the first placeThey did not enjoy Aintree two years ago and did not think that Ghofar who was unplaced to Mr Friskenjoyed himself much eitherBut like so many ownersthey have learnt from experience that when David Elsworth takes a view about horsesit seldom pays to disagreeNine times out of 10however improbablyhe turns out to be rightElsworthwho blames himself for choosing the wrong racefor Ghofar twice this seasonis now convinced the horse is a much more adaptable jumper than the rather hesitant seven-year-old Brendan Powell rode in 1990Ghofarincurably idle at homehas not run since FebruaryBut he was taken last month to Bill Wightman's gallops on the lovely downland on which the great Halloween was trainedElsworth saysA new place gees him up a bitWe went two miles not quite like Halloween perhaps but still not badHe is fit and there won't be a healthier-looking horse in the fieldGHOFAR'S gleaming coat is left unclipped for the excellent reason thatlike the immortal Crisphe won't allow a clipping machine near himIf only he could inherit a few more of the great Australian chaser's foiblesthis afternoon's first prize would be in the bagInsteadas David Elsworth admitswith Gold Cup horses giving him only a few poundsit is asking an awful lotBy modern standardsthis is a hard National to winIt may well bebut the question of how much the Gold Cup took out of Cool Ground and Docklands Express will only be answered when the heat is onThe dismal post-war record of Gold Cup winners is hard to ignore and Cool Ground is no Prince RegentA much fresher horse who has been trained for this all season is Brown Windsorfourth two years agoUnless it rainsthe ground should suit him fineand Richard Dunwoody showed on Thursday just how priceless his assistance can beNow that Party Politics has been sold reportedly for an offer Mr Stoddart would have been insane to refuse Brown Windsor and Auntie Dot are the only two runners bred by their ownersThat puts them firmly into my wishful thinkinggroup but strictly on formthey are still sensible selectionsBrown WindsorI regret to addis extremely well handicapped with GhofarWillsford would be my other suggestionHe would probably like it softerbut whatever your view of Mrs Pitmanhis traineras a strategist and communicatorthere is no doubt at all of her ability to train Grand National horsesGood luck to all of themand how wonderful it would be ifeven when things get tight towards the endthe

historic Second Division doubleBy Colin GibsonIF THE romantics have their wayJim Smith and Malcolm Crosby will lead their teams out to create a piece of FA Cup final history on May 9But while the FA Cup can still turn dreams into realitythe Second Division might have to settle for one representative at Wembley after tomorrow's semi-finalsIt is not always the best side that wins an FA Cup semi-finalin the mainit is normally the most experienced team that succeedsThat could be the vital ingredient for Sunderland as they attempt to embarrass Norwich and the Roker Park directors at Hillsborough by producing the club's best result in 19 yearsSince Mr Crosby became their caretaker-mangerSunderland have undergone a remarkable change of fortuneand that improved form has never been more obvious than in the CupThey have already knocked out First Division West Ham and Chelsea andin this cluttered sporting weekendNorwich could be another fallerThough Norwich reached the FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park in 1989they were left with only three survivors from the team which lost to Everton when Ian Crook withdrew yesterdayDave Stringerthe Norwich managerrecalls that Everton's greater experience was the decisive factorThey were much more relaxed than we werehe saidThey had seen it all beforeNorwich lost key components of their team in the run-up to the Everton game just as they have for tomorrow's tieThree years ago Mike Phelannow with Manchester Unitedwas injured and Robert Fleck was given compassionate leave after his father died on the eve of the gameTomorrow Fleck is again likely to be absent unless he overcomes an aversion to pain-killers and injectionswhile Scottish international goalkeeper Bryan Gunn is a long-term casualtyIn contrastSunderland have a rich seam of experienced playersamong them Paul Bracewellwho played for Everton in the 1989 semi-finalBracewell has been a three-times loser in FA Cup finalsbut this season his vault of knowledge has been a key factor especially in the recovery at Stamford Bridge against ChelseaJohn Byrnewho equalised that nightPeter DavenportWelsh international Tony Norman and Northern Ireland's Anton Rogana Scottish Cup-winner with Celticall provide Sunderland with essential experienceIt is a factor that Mr Crosby recognisesTactics can win you these gamesbut more often than not it is whether the players have the experience and the bottleIt will be a strange afternoon for the directors from Roker ParkShould Sunderland winthe pressure to appoint Mr Crosby as full-time manager will increaseThey have shown a stubborn reluctance to take that course so farwhich leads to the belief that they have already promised the job elsewhereMr Crosby saidI also have 10 important League matches left and have said all along that if we don't win these as well I cannot expect to be given the job hereIt wouldMr Crosby appreciatesbe wonderful to leave Sunderlanda club he has worshipped since he was a boyas FA Cup

Malcolm CrosbyMr Stringer48began his managerial apprenticeship at Carrow Road five years ago in similar circumstances to those Mr Crosby is facing at Roker ParkThough he survived and prosperedthere have been times this season when the chances of Mr Stringer lasting as Norwich manager until FA Cup semi-final day seemed remoteIn mid-February Norwich appeared on the verge of crisisThey had slipped down the First Divisionlosing five consecutive League matchesThe fans became restless and the soccer grapevine was alive with names of likely successors to Mr StringerSo intense did the criticism become that Mr Stringerwho has been connected as playercoach and now manager with Norwich for almost 30 yearstook the unprecedented step of going on national radio to defend himself and his playersHad Norwich not defeated Notts County in the fifth round that afternoonit could well have been Mr Stringer's first and last address to the nation's footballing publicBut win Norwich did and they have since gone on to preserve their First Division lives and reach the FA Cup semi-finalsMr Stringer now appears relatively safebut he could have been the victim of his own successAfter taking over from Ken Brown in the winter of 1987 he guided the club to unexpected heightsThe day he walked into the manager's office Norwich were bottom of the First Division and relegation was more a probability than possibilityWithin 18 months he had taken the club to the FA Cup semi-final and their highest League position in the club's 87-year historySuddenly a soccer backwater had tasted success butas Mr Stringer readily admitsWe have always had the problem of being sidetrackedThis season threatened to be another one of disruptive distractionsAfter reaching the Rumbelows Cup quarter-finalNorwich's season stood stillIt was then that the club's management co-operative gave Mr Stringer so much supportand the relationship is now reciprocated with Mr Stringer only too happy for the role of coaches Dave Williams and Mike Walker to be appreciatedWe all contributehe said without the slightest hint of a bruised egoWe all have our roles to play and I am delighted that people like Dave Williams should receive the credit for their workBut he also recognises that part of his role is to accept the criticismI know that comes with the jobhe saidIf I am the targetthoughI can be the shield so that others can carry on with their jobsI might understand it but I don't know anyone who enjoys the criticismYou would have to be a masochist to do thatDespite the disquiet at the club this yearMr Stringer still appears more relaxed and more in control than he did when he first took charge in that winter of 1987It was not really the normal way of getting a manager's jobThe circumstances were very similar to those the lad at Sunderland finds himself in nowhe saidThe position almost evolvedUnlike Mr Crosbythe Norwich manager did not have the groundswell of support when he was appointedIf the fans had been given their choiceMel Machinthen at Manchester Citywould have been offered the jobIt seems that Mr Stringer has never really enjoyed a close relationship with the supporters sincebut that could all change at Hillsborough tomorrow afternoonFor the management careers of both Dave Stringer and Malcolm Crosbythis is likely to be a crucial semi-finalSOCCERDIARY Press box king rewriting the record booksBy Colin MalamSHOULD Portsmouth beat Liverpool in tomorrow's FA Cup semi-final and reach WembleyMike Neasomfootball and cricket writer for The NewsPortsmouthwill prepare to visit the 95th English ground at which he has covered PompeyMr Neasom57must have set some kind of record since 1974when he began reporting Portsmouth matchesThe club's travels up and down the four divisions in the last 18 years have helpedand he completed the full set of 92 grounds at Watford three or four years agoThe total has increased because Mr Neasom has covered Bradford City v Portsmouth at Odsal as well as Valley Paradeand Bristol Rovers v Portsmouth at both Eastville and Twerton ParkBathSo what price the tonI suppose I could do itsays Mr NeasomI've not been to the new grounds at Walsall and ScunthorpeMaidstone's groundor covered a League match at BarnetThen there's the question of whether an extra club comes up from the Vauxhall Conference to replace Aldershot and the possibility of clubs moving to new groundsA lifelong Portsmouth fanMr Neasom watched his first First Division match at Fratton Park in 1947Obviouslythis semi-final is one of the highlightshe saysBut I won't be leaping out of my seat if Pompey winYou just don't do that in the press boxIF tomorrow's semi-final between Liverpool and Portsmouth at Highbury requires a replayit will have to wait until a week on Mondaybecause of Thursday's General ElectionOriginallythe replay was scheduled for next Wednesday at Villa Parkbut West Midlands Police objectedpointing out they did not have the manpower to handle a match of that magnitude on the eve of polling dayPLEASURE at the news that Paul Gascoigne is to begin his long-awaited comeback at the end of this month is matched by admiration for an unpublicised example of the Tottenham Terror's generosity off the fieldGazza recently put up £1,500 of his own money to get Spurs' hospital radio service back on air when shortage of funds forced it to close downA total of £3,000 was needed and the player offered to provide half the amount if Tottenham would supply the other halfwhich they proceeded to doGAZZA was the excuse for an April Fool's joke that backfired on Radio Nottingham this weekThe BBC station hoaxed their listeners with a report that the great man was about to sign for Notts County to prove his fitness before joining Lazio in the summerMany County supporters believed the interviewin which the England international was impersonated by Radio Nottingham's sports presenterMartin FisherSo when the station came cleanthey had to

for Pompey chimes and no clangersBy Christopher DaviesWHILE television has helped to make heroes out of many playerssuch as Portsmouth winger Darren Anderton during their FA Cup runthe publicity provided by the cameras can be a double-edged swordAlan KnightPortsmouth's longest-serving playeris only too aware of what television can do to his fellow goalkeepers not least Liverpool's Bruce Grobbelaarhis opposite number in tomorrow's semi-finalSecond Division Portsmouth are in the Highbury tie courtesy of a dreadful mistake in the quarter-finals by Nottingham Forest's Mark Crossleywho dropped the ball for Alan McLoughlin to score the only goal of the gameI'd be a liar if I said this sort of thing has not crossed my mindsays KnightI'm not saying I lose sleep about itbut the prospect of making a howler in front of millions of people is a worryTelevision has destroyed some goalkeepersCrossley's mistake was great for us but devastating for himand he's no longer in their sideAllen McKnight West Hamand Jim Leighton Manchester Unitedhave also sufferedA goalkeeper is in the most visible position of allHe can either be a hero or the biggest idiot in the worldBut this day is something I've dreamed of since I was a kid and I just want to enjoy itI don't want to speak too soonbut I think I've been fairly consistent this seasonOn any other dayKnight would hope Grobbelaar plays a blinder and is on the winning sideEver since he watched Grobbelaar play for Crewe at Fratton Park 13 years agoKnight has been an admirer of the extrovert Zimbabwe internationalHe gets a lot of stick about his mistakes but he's very positive and has the confidence to keep coming for the ballI think he won Liverpool the game FA Cup quarter-finalagainst Aston VillaI remember seeing him when I was an apprentice and even then it was obvious what a good goalkeeper he'd beI've not modelled myself on BruceI'm not one to do double somersaults I'm not that acrobatic but he's one of the best in the country and has been for a long timeI've met him at a couple of PFA functions and when it was my testimonial he sent some things down to be raffledConsidering I hardly knew the guyit was a very nice touchPeople call him a clown after he's made a mistakebut in my mind he's a master goalkeeperSuch is his make-up that he will come for just about any centre because he believes he can reach the ballI wish I had his self-confidenceBecause Liverpool are on television such a lot he's had to pay the priceas any errors have been magnifiedBut I think he's an outstanding goalkeeperHe stops short of hoping Grobbelaar makes one of his increasingly frequent mistakes tomorrowbut Knight is professional enough to know that a team has to take advantage of any breaks that come their wayKnight30may not have enjoyed the success Grobbelaar hasbut his career has rarely had a dull moment since he signed as a 14-year-old schoolboy when Ian St John was managerAt that time it was SOS Pompey and the club were said to have only a week to surviveThey were selling bits of turf to keep goingI played in the last game in the Third Division before we were relegated to the FourthI have played all the way

August 1999Lord Justice Taylorrecently appointed Lord Chief Justicesaid that the 95 deaths during and after the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest might have been avoided in an all-seat stadiumIn response to Labour's movethe Prime Minister is believed to be considering a similar actionMr Major has said privately that he does not believe it is necessary to follow the Taylor recommendations to the letterbut he will insist that the changes are made for First and Second Division clubsThe Prime Ministera Chelsea supporterbelieves that much of the cash needed can be

HomeNot quite creased up by the newimproved wonder ironBy MARK EDMONDSWITH the average freelance ironer charging Gentlemen Who Don't 50 pence a shirtthe professionalsteam iron to be launched next month by Philips sounds excellent value at £170Slobs like me who iron only when they are forced toand then only the bits that showstand to recoup their investment after less than a year's worth of shirtsThe huge price tag attached to the iron certainly promises a great dealSince you can pick up a no-frills steam iron for £40 or £50 I assumed it would take all the angst out of what is arguably the last of the genuinely ghastly domestic choresI had every hope that the industrial-strength whoosh of steam the manufacturers trumpet so loudly would present me with crease-free shirts and service my morning cappuccinoPhilips says this is the first example of a professionalsteam iron to hit the British shopsIn Italy and Francehoweverthese super-irons are commonplace and account for 50 per cent of annual salesThis probably indicates one of two thingsContinental Europeans are more particular about the state of their shirtsor they are less particular about the claims of the manufacturersIt comes in two partsThe first seems conventional enough standard iron shapeflex attachment to power source from handle although its separate vapour tankwas a new one on meThe whole caboodleheavy and cumbersomelooked as though it might be more at home in a grand hotel than a north London flatprecisely the image the manufacturer is trying to get acrossIt is the vapour tank that is the key to the machine's alleged superiority over other steam ironsThis takes a full litre of water enough for one-and-a-half hours of constant steam ironing without going back to the tapThe tank produces 50 grams of steam per minute about three times that of a conventional steam iron and feeds it directly into the iron via a cord in its sideA separate sole plate heats up the steam even moreproducing a much more powerful jetOnce I'd mastered a none-too-straightforward control panelwhich looks rather like those muticoloured ever-flickering computers you find on the dashboard of executive carsmy test run got under wayBriefed comprehensively by my fastidious fiancee on ironing strategy Never start from the front/make sure you give the cuffs a decent jet of steamnot like thatyou chumpI set about a pile of shirtsmainly cotton but one silkand a range of trousersFirst you must fill the tank a relatively idiot-proof exercisethough you must remember to unscrew it carefully and slowly when replenishing itsince the steam is kept under considerable pressureA pilot light on the tank's control panel conveniently lets you know when the iron is running out of steamThere is no doubting the iron's powerEven the shirts which had been left for many weeks in my laundry out-tray responded to the punishment it dished outThe iron's triggerconcealed in its handlewas jolly good fun to operateOne squeeze and you've strafed even the most determined of creases out of existencea separate jet of steamwhich is activated by a button on top of the handleis useful for sniper attacks on hard-to-defeat cuff wrinklesIrons I've used before have also offered this facilitybut I've always found I've ended up toing and froing between the tap once too oftenThe capacity of the Philips iron keeps this to a minimumAlso usefulI'm sureis the facility for ironing curtainsupholsteryand even jackets and shirts verticallyThe jet of steam can be aimed at particularly stubborn creasesand there is also a spray attachment which you can use to cover larger areasIts bulkhoweverwas a problemwhich might make vertical ironing a little impracticalA broad-beamed fellow like myself should have no difficulty careering it across the ironing boardalthough a woman or even a bachelor-wimp might sooner resort to an old-fashioned metal iron than attempt to put this monster through its pacesAnother design fault rests with the flexsince it protrudes from the heelyou can't stand it up when you're not using itYou also need plenty of roomsince the iron does not operate independently of the vapour tankBut I couldn't argue with the machine's efficiencyMy shirts and trousers emerged from the exercise crease-freewith only the minimum of effort on my partIt coped admirably with a range of different materialsWhile I can't say I actually enjoyed the experience as usualtwo shirts flaked me out and put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day I did find the whole process a whole lot easier on the nerves than throwing a glass of water across a shirt in the hope that somehow the creasesalong with the waterwould eventually evaporateAt HomePRIZED POSSESSIONSBy JOHN BLYSENT BY a reader in

millionIt was not always thusin 1983when Christie's sold the first batch of 25,000 pieces of Ming porcelainfound also by Hatcherin a junk on a reef on the South China Seaprices were lowbecause neither auction house nor collectors could see beyond the porcelain's dull glaze to its historic possibilitiesA year laterwith a second salethe British Museum and other astute buyers started to collect shipwrecked porcelainwhich was beginning to tell historians a lot about the 18th-century European buyers and their influence on the EastBy 198620,000 people queued to view the Nanking ware in AmsterdamWhen large quantities of Chinese blue and white porcelain first arrived in Europe in the 17th century the demand was so high it was nicknamed Chinamaniathe phrase is just as apt todayMichael Cohena specialist dealer in oriental porcelain who expects to be a big bidder at next week's salespent more than £1 million buying Nanking piecesI bought a lot at the saleWe sold over 22,000 objects in two or three daysThen I started buying from other dealers to satisfy demandAt the starta tea cup and saucer was selling for around £30 in my shopby the third day they were nearer £200 and still sellingThough Christie's says that the Vung Tau sale is lotted to encourage private buyerswith sets of between five and nine matching vases offered per lot and designed to be shownas they were in the 17th centurymassed together on a chimneypiece or high shelfCohen believes buying is more easily done through a dealerOnly 30 per cent of Vung Tau is perfectthe rest is damagedfrom a small chip to half the piece missingThen it's necessary to re-view the lots to make sure they haven't been further damaged during the viewHe's had 10 times the number of commission bids for Vung Tau as he had for Nanking and this is a much smaller cargoColin Sheafwho will auction Vung Taurang me from Hong Kong to say there was a great deal of interest there and in Singapore in the cargoand catalogues were selling fastThe first print run of 6,000 sold out and a second of 4,000 is moving quicklyAnyone worrying as dealers and Christie's once did that these thousands of 300-year-old pots will flood the

and goldand in 1988 homely spadesbelaying pins and scrubbing brushes from HMS Invinciblea Royal Navy warship which foundered on a sandbankButfor my moneythe most heart-wrenching of all was the discovery of the wreck of Nuestra Senora de Atochawhich sank in 1622dragged to the bottom in a gale by the weight of silver and gold aboard no less than 17 tons of silver and 500 pounds of goldNone of the 268 people on her escaped they were trapped beneath the storm-battened hatchesThe rosaries and crucifixes of four drowned prieststhe contraband smuggled aboardperhaps by a doomed explorer and his

are too highOffering the children a reward to achieve a standard they may feel they never can is often counter-productiveThey are quite likely to give upI feel that children should be brought up with the idea of doing the best they can for themselvesShe is amazed how many teenagers are allowed out during the week in the run-up to examinationsParents are too frightened to say noMany suffer from the liberal philosophy they remember from the '60s and don't want to sort out their priorities on their own however much they assure you they canAnd if parents have special knowledge of a subject they should help the childBanning television or video games during the week is common senseDealing with your children's friends who pop round in the evening calls for consummate diplomacy and the setting of time limitsAccording to Dr Judith Haynes of the educational psychologists' group Child Consultantsthe crucial thing is for parents to gain the child's co-operation in establishing a revision regime in the weeks leading up to examinationsThere is no point being heavy-handed and threateningshe saysYou must regard exams as a joint problem you must solve togetherSupport and involvement rather than nagging are the watchwordsShe is not averse to briberyBut it should be for work done each day or week not a promise that hangs on resultsThere is little point in distant bribeshowever juicyIt is too easy then for children to put off the evil day when they have to get down to workThe most important thing is to organise a system that encourages them to stick at it day by day and week by weekGiving extra pocket money for good work on a daily basis is far more effectiveBut it does mean parents must be totally involvedALASTAIR GRAHAMheadmaster of Mill Hill Schoolnorth Londonsays parents who have

to involve children in every aspect of the parental lifeIt is a commonplace that children now seem to grow up alarmingly fasteducation and the media combining to erode the apparent gap between the generationsWhere kids become worldly-wise with such rapidityit is easy for a certain laissez-faire to creep inthey expect to have unbridled access to everythingand in the long run this is not doing any favours to either party concernedOne of the most difficult things for modern parents is to remind ourselves that we must maintain a life of our ownIn practical termsthere are the notions of

weathersays Fred WhitseyPut the first seeds downBy FRED WHITSEYTURN the page of the calendarand before you is the first weekend of AprilAnd you feel anxious about getting the first lot of seeds sown out of doorsAnxiousbecause you know from past experience that when the convenient moment arrives for you to sowthe weather will turn wet or coldeven snowyand effort and seed would be wastedyet time is slipping by and the crops most worth raising are those that come firstBut this year the condition of the soil is on our sideAdd to this some newly-evolved simple techniquesand this year we can work according to the calendarindependent of the weatherCharts published recently show how severe is the water shortage in many parts of the countryBut this means that the soil for seed-sowing can be done simply by covering a patch for a few days with a sheet of polythene anchored by bricks or stones in the absenceof courseof clochesThe plastic ones now on sale in every garden centre are much more manageable than the old glass typewhich were always getting brokenThe arrival of fibre fleecea lightweight fabricalso sold in garden storeshas transformed vegetable growing in several waysOnce you have sown the seedyou cover the whole area with thisIt traps the warmth of the odd sunny spelland wards off the critical few degrees of coldIt admits both light and rainthough impedes the force of those heavy showers that can cake the soiland sometimes wash out the seedsYou can leave the fabric in place almost until you are ready to gather your crops as it is so light the plants just push it up as they growOf coursethis lightness means the wind can take it unless you anchor it downRegular users of it wrap the edges round wooden batonssecured with a few tacksleaving these to rest on the groundand rolling it up on the batons when the season is overAll this applies to open-ground sowingsand of course it is the crops from these that move fastest as they suffer no transplanting adjustmentsThey include beetlettucebroad beanscarrotspeas and spinachall of which need to be sown as soon as possible nowWhat must seem stupid to non-gardenersor those who take a rational view of the whole businessis that when you prepare the ground for sowing you first dig it over and make it looseonly to tread it firm againBut in the process you are refining the soil to the liking of the roots that in a little while will ramify in itYou are letting in the air they likeYou are incorporating humus on which the beneficial bacteria thrive and which both drains the soil of surplus moistureyet holds it in the right degreeYou are also turning up the relics of perennial weeds that can be difficult to eliminate laterWhile vegetables generally have the capacity to germinate soon after spring sowinghowever low the temperature dropsflower seedsalso due for sowing soon on adjacent land to provide cut flowers during the summerdo need more warmth to get goingThe same techniques and ground preparation suits themthough of course the fleece has to be removed when the seedlings are upThese include the old favourite annual chrysanthemums and larkspurclarkia and godetiasweet peas and

early summer pot plant and zinniasthe closest thing you can get to those expensive gerberasWhen you tip the seed from the packet it is hard to believe that from almost every one a plant will ariseso do not let them fall too thickly into the soilThe impulse to make suremust be curbedAgainwhen the seedlings are up you have to be harsh and thinthinthinPerpetual spinach and carrots will tolerate

offer you can refuse Mark Edmonds is all for haggling but not when it turns to meannessBy MARK EDMONDSTHE depressed state of our own economy recently presented holidaymakers bound for Asia and Africa with an unexpected opportunity to practise shopping techniques common in some parts of the globe before they set offWith retail sales in declinehaggling usually more appropriate to the souks of Tangier than our domestic department stores is becoming more common hereIn Morocco and many other Arab countrieshaggling is a deeply ritualised affairAnd while holidaymakers are whipped up to almost frenzied levels of opportunistic greed by guidebooks which insist that real travellers never pay the first price they are quotedfew have any prospect of coming out of a deal better than the merchant who initiated itSometimes a merchant in a souk will settle for perhaps a profit of only five per centsays Mr Latif of the Moroccan Tourist BoardThat will be enough for himbecause he knows that next time he will make more moneyperhaps 10perhaps even 50 per centThat is the way he conducts his business and that is the way it has been for centuriesIf you don't want or don't have time to hagglesays Mr Latifyou should make sure you buy your carpetyour jewelleryor your woodwork from a fixed-price storeThese shops sell items which are produced and sold by co-operativesand both price and quality is guaranteedIf you do decide to buy from a private bazaar you will be expected to haggleNo merchant will imagine that you will agree to pay the first price he suggestsYour first offer should be about half what the merchant asks and you should beat him down from thereGuidebooks and holiday brochures make a point of explaining ploys which can be adopted to bring a price downThe Rough Guide for Moroccofor instancesuggests that it may help to take along an apparently disinterested friend to the shop or bazaarin an effort to hurry the deal alongyour friend is supposed to express the desire to leaveIn Asiahaggling is widespreadalthough its intricacies are neither as complicated nor as deeply engrained as in the Middle EastIn Indiafixed-price shops exist not only for the benefit of travellerslocals use them as wellAlthough haggling is common in countries such as Indiait is a mistake to assume that it is standard practice throughout the worldTo their shamemany tourists fired up by the prospect of making a fast rupeedirham or peso are prepared to haggle for everythingranging from the price of a cup of tea to an airline ticketSuch is their determination that the actual value of the item they want to buy in comparison with what it would cost at home becomes irrelevantAll that matters is getting one over the traderIn generalthe rule with haggling is to do as the locals dotaking particular care not to beat down those who are selling items they have made themselvesMiddlemenas Trisha Barnett of the pressure group Tourism Concern points outare much less vulnerableWe came across some people from Papua New Guinea who were selling handicrafts and were confronted with a boatload of western tourists all convinced they could buy for a knock-down rateThe people selling the stuff had never come across haggling before and they were left thinking that it is the norm in western societyThe saddest thing is that we've been persuaded that true travellers know how to

accidents take a tumbleBy Peter HardyTHE number of avalanche deaths in the main Alpine countries has dropped by as much as 70 per centperhaps because of the consistency of snow cover throughout the winterWith only four weeks of the season remaining10 people have so far been killed in avalanches in Switzerland against the national average of 37 during the winter monthsUnofficial figures from the other major Alpine countries suggest similarly low statisticswith Austria reporting only six avalanche deaths to dateThe reasonaccording to the Davos Snow and Avalanche Research Centre which recorded the figuresis that there is so much more snow than usual this yearWe've got more snow up here and all over the Swiss Alps than we have had in 50 yearssaid Dr Othmar Buserwhose research centre is perched at 2,660m on the Weissfluhjoch above DavosGenerallythe more snowthe less danger there is to skiersThe snow is so deep three metres outside the door here that after big stormspotentially dangerous ski areas remain inaccessible for a few daysThis allows the snow to gain some stabilityOf coursethe more snowthe more avalanches come down on to roads and into the valleysbut it is skiers who are normally most at riskThe sub-zero temperatures which have accompanied the latest heavy storms are good news for skiers planning late Easter holidaysNot only is the snow cover likely to remain comfortable in the high resorts right into the start of Maybut the lower the temperaturethe safer the snowAs long as the low temperatures continuewe are happy that the avalanche danger is containedadded Dr BuserThe number of skiers killed or injured on piste is also continuing to fallaccording to statistics released by the Austrian Ski FederationIn the 11 weeks up to March 20a total of 46 people died on the snow in AustriaThe statistics include heart attacks and other natural causes as well as accidents to hikersclimbersand mountain workersA total of 14 people died on the piste including four casualties of the chairlift accident in Carinthia and four heart attacksOnly one person was reported killed as a result of a collision with another skierA further eight skiers were killed in accidents close to the prepared pisteand 18 were killed climbing or skiing in open countryDr Klaus Leistnersecretary-general of the Austrian Ski FederationsaidOne death in skiing is one death too manybut our statistics show thatbecause of public awareness and the great improvements in equipmentthe sport is becoming saferThe number of injuries is actually going down in proportion to the increased number of skiersWhen you consider that Austrian lifts handled 480 million passengers last year and that 2.5 million native Austrians are skiers excluding tourists the accident figures are very smallThe chance of being killed is 0.9 per 100,000TravelA Wright little gem Hugh Massingberd visits an intimate manor housenewly opened to the publicin the Derbyshire plague village of EyamBy

ancient cattle thieves of the Cheviot HillsBy CHRISTOPHER SOMERVILLEWHEN a Charlton chief sat down to dinner in times gone by and found a spur on the table where his meal should have beenhe knew the cupboard was bare once His wife was telling him to saddle up and steal a fresh batch of cattle from his neighbour's herdsThe families of North Tynedale in westernmost Northumberland Charltons and RobsonsMilburns and Dodds were never slow to lay hands on each other 's property in the lawless old daysHerewhere the Scottish border ran across the Cheviot Hillsfar from civilisationreivingor cattle-thievingwas a way of lifeRemoteness is still the keynote of this regionbut a Charlton reiving party would be hard put to it these days to work up a good gallop along the upper reaches of the North Tyne RiverSince 1926 the western fringes of the Cheviots have been planted with 250 square miles of close-packed coniferswhile in their depths sprawl the seven miles of the Kielder Water reservoirEurope's largest man-made lakeI found it hard to picture what kind of landscape those statistics might have shapeduntil I opened the Ordnance Survey map to find half of it coloured green with a great blue stain in the centreKielder Water is beautifuland the Kielder trees formidably impressive in their domination of the hillsBut by the time I had turned off the road from Bellingham at Kielder village and driven up the bumpy Forest Drive to East Kielder FarmI was longing for the sight of something other than water and treesRelief was at handThe farm stands on a spur of moorland on the northern edge of the forestand within 10 minutes I had turned my back on the corduroy battalions of trees and was striding under a stillcloudy sky over tussocks of rush and coarse grasswith my face to the longbare shoulders of open hillside that flank the winding shallows of the East Kielder BurnThe footpath that runs with the burn is not one of those carefully waymarked and leafleted by the Forestry CommissionThere are few attractions for the Kielder tourist hereThe burn threads a wild and inhospitable crevice of the hillswhere the wind blows cold and the sense of isolation grows with each lonely mileWalking hereyou leave the 20th century behind on the outskirts of the forest and enter the reconstructed emptiness in which the reivers and cross-border raiders of the past could operate unhinderedI squelched across tiny burns running in black channels of peatand stood looking down from the hillside on to the grey roofs of Scaup FarmThe hollow barking of a dog came from one of the stone shedsbut there was no sign of life around the buildingsScaup must be just about the loneliest farm in Englandtucked down in the shelter of the hills with Kielder Forest's dark mass blocking its southward view and the narrowing valley of the burn filling half the sky to the northThe East Kielder Burn divides here into Scaup Burn and White Kielder BurnI dropped down the hill to ford White Kielder upstream of the ruined farmstead of Kielder Headwhere a line of stunted aldersshaggy with lichenleaned over their leafless reflections in the peat-brown waterSpring comes late to this windbitten and rain-soaked valleyBut there were new-born lambs in the sheep pens of Scaupand a cheery Hello nowfrom the farmer and his wife tending themThose were the last human voices I heard all dayNo-one lives up here in the cleft of the White Kielder BurnThe rough land is altogether too harsh and unyieldinggiving sustenance only to sheepand to the conifers high on the flanks of East Kielder Moor and Grey Mares Knoweimmense sweeps of hillside to right and left of the valleyThe footpath on the left bank of the burn was little better than a sheep trackbut there were clues to its former importance as a droving road over the hills to Byrness in RedesdaleLarge boulders stood out beside the path as grey blobs in the featureless sheets of pale grassand flat stones had been placed as bridges across the burnstheir backs hollowed by the tread of feet through the centuriesFollowing these now disregarded signs of past activity along the old pathI traversed the hillside and came down to a crumbling stone sheepfold with the roofless remains of a shepherd's hut built into one wallThe tiny single room was jammed with the mossy timbers of disused sheep pensbut the little iron fire grate that once warmed the hardy men who worked here was still set in the foot of the hut's tottering gable endand the massive stone lintel had not yet fallen from its place above the doorwayA dipper flew up from the burn as I emerged from the huthis white breast flashing as he darted downstreamSomewhere ahead in the crags of Kielderhead Moor a hawk was whistlinga piercing sound in the lonely valleyoverlain for a few heart-stopping moments by the snarl of a jetThat jarring manifestation of furious technology seemed as remote and ridiculous as a dreamas silence settled down on Kielderhead and the hawk's whistle came down from the moorsThe valley of the White Kielder Burn steepened again as I trudged northits curves tighteningNow the path ran through heather high above the burnpast circular sheepfolds long disused and over the stony beds of side streams where the grass hung smooth and invitingconcealing ankle-breaking dropsA mile above the shepherd's hut the hillsides ceased their upward rolling and curved together to form a dead-end valley of broad-breasted slopes five miles from the nearest tarmac roadhidden deep in the folds of the moorsThe old drover's road turned aside here and climbed under the rock faces of White Crags to continue its lonely course over Girdle Fell and down into RedesdaleI could have gone with itgiving myself four blissful miles of upland walking followed by as many miserable hours of fruitless searching for return transport to East Kielder FarmInstead I lay back in the heather and savoured the trickle of the burn and the crisp smell of peat-laden groundNot a sign of spring had yet penetrated this secret valleybut another month would put that rightThere were five miles of return tramping to facebut theytoocould wait awhileTravelA

17 19and we were on a month-long adventure organised by World Challenge Expeditionsa company which offers young people the opportunity to join treks around the worldfrom the mountains of Nepal to the rainforests of EcuadorThe expeditions are based on the ethos of ChallengeParticipation and Environmentand strong emphasis is also placed on teamwork and leadershipSelection for the trip involved an interview for every candidate andfor somean assessment weekendthough I missed this as I was a late entrantThe build-up training at Easthampstead Parkin Berkshirewas a chance for the group and the two leaders to get to know each otherPeople came from all over Britain from a quiet Scottish village to the suburbs of Manchester but everyone appeared to have a relatively comfortable backgroundThis did not mean their parents had happily shelled out the £2,000 for the trip many had been sponsored by local firms and one girl had taken out a bank loanAs guidebooks will tell youyou should not rush your acclimatisation period when you arrive in the Far EastBut we had only a month in Borneo and after just three days rather than the recommended three weeks relaxing in Mirithe capital of Sarawakwe were looking forward to getting down to some trekkingthe purpose of the tripThis first phaseof the trip took us to the caves of Mulu National Park and Gunung Mulu mountainOnce we started trekking we soon discovered that mental attitude and camaraderie were far more important than physical fitnessThere was a lot of teasing and we had soon thought up nicknames for each otherAs we walked some of us played Twenty Questions to keep us goingYessaid the Mr Bean lookalikeIs he an entertainerOthers preferred WalkmansSinging along to them in the middle of the jungle did seem a little oddbut it kept our minds off thingseven if it invited torrents of abuseOur first trekup Gunung Muluwas the hardest of the whole expedition and came as a shock to the systemIt was supposed to take three to five daysbut we aimed to do it in twoAlthough there were tracksthey were not very clearand the going was made harder by the tree roots and vines which tripped up anyone who was foolish enough to try to look aroundThe climb was so steep that in places it could be made only with the help of ropesThe group tended to string outwith the fittest boys at the frontand the girls well behindThe leaders had their work cut out keeping the group togetherand one or both had to remain at the back to motivate the slower ones the most effective method seemed to be carrying their kitthough this tended to be a last resortWhen we got to the halfway camptwo of us were not feeling up to the rest of the climband spent the night thereFor those who made the summitit wasdisappointinglyshrouded in cloudThe next dayalthough three of the team made the descent by mid-afternoonthe rest spent three or four hours walking after darkwith only a few torches between them to light the wayTo say we were physically exhausted does not begin to describe how we felt when we finally made itand it was only a small consolation to hear that we would not start until 9 am the following morningThis trek also marked our first encounter with leechesThe less squeamish members of the group had the delight of checking the others' feetwhile they sat with gritted teeth and eyes tight shutThe most effective prevention for leeches was not our trouser elasticsas we had believedbut a squirt of insect repellent around the tops of our bootsThis was about the only use for insect repellentas the mosquitoes seemed to have become hardened to the hundreds of tourists who had trekked through before usThe next trekking phasein Bariowas a much easier eight-day walk through a series of villagesAlthough described by the World Challenge brochure as an area rarely visited by Europeansit turned out to be popular enough with tourists for each village to have its own visitors' bookThe villagers lived in a singlecommunal building known as a longhousebuilt on stilts to prevent flooding in the rainy seasonEach family had its own bedrooms in one buildingjoined by short plank walkways to the main living areawhere again each family had its own space with a small cooking areaThere were no solid divisions between neighboursand the children played up and down the length of the houseEvening distractions were fewalthough we did hear Sinead O'Connor blasting out in the early hours in one villageand we spent one evening joining in with some traditional dancing the original TwistThe longhouses were a welcome break after a day's trek and were a great experienceOur hosts were most generoussharing their food with us and insisting on giving us their bedroomsThis made our Bario trek the easiest in terms of home comfortsFor much of the rest of the time we slept and cooked outthough most people never actually slept in their hammocks as the trees grew inconveniently far apartInstead we used our ponchos as makeshift tentsBetween two people one poncho was used as a groundsheet and the other was strung up and pinned down with home-made pegsThe high point of the whole trip for me came when seven of us trekked into the mountains to spend the night by a waterfallThe climb was very toughtaking eight hours in alland in places the guides had to cut away the plants to clear a routeAs we climbed higher the jungle became more marshy and exoticwith the sort of plants you usually only see as plastic decorationsNow the guides' training in jungle warfare came into its ownTheir curious calling attracted some gibbonsour first real sighting of wildlifeThen the guides lured a barking deerwith the sound of a pipe they made out of half-split bambooThey promptly shot it for dinnera welcome break from dehydrated rationsThey spent half an hour skinning it and gutting ittaking almost everythingincluding the brain and intestines whichfortunatelythey kept for themselves to eatThe waterfall itself was spectaculara 50 ft torrent falling over a sheer rockfacewith moss-covered precipices rising on either sideWe made our camp in a small clearing by the top of the fallsAs it began to get darkwe all settled around the guides' firesharing the barbecued deer for supperAs one of the leaders commentedthis day's trek was exactly what we had come to the jungle forOur month in Borneo certainly didn't feel like an organised holidayThe fact that we had definite goals on each treksuch as reaching a summit by sunrisemade the whole thing feel like an expeditionBut our two leaders had bitten off more than they could chew when they tried to make leaders out of the rest of usOur sense of adventure only went so far and we relied on them to make the decisionsTeam spirit was much in evidence thoughwith the fitter people helping the strugglers and always giving encouragementIn this friendly atmosphereplans for a reunion had already started before we were halfway throughand many people still keep in touch with each other back homeTravelIt's a quite different class of excitementBy Richard SnailhamTHIS SUMMER the British Schools' Exploring Society is celebrating its Diamond JubileeSince its founding in 1932 the BSES has given more than 4,000 youngsters a taste of adventure and a chance to do some survey workmainly in Arctic terrainThis year there will be a Jubilee Expedition to the forest region of northern Finland to which the founderSurgeon-Commander G. Murray LevickRNled the first expedition 60 years agoLevick's brainchild began life as the Public Schools' Exploring SocietyAfter the Second World War it broadened to include all boys' schoolsIn the late 1970safter a considerable hoo-hagirls were recognised as fit to be young explorers and the first mixed expedition went to Arctic Norway in 1980In the early years the society mounted just one annual expedition for 50 65 boysthis year there will be fourinvolving over 150 young peopleBut the essence remains the samea Chief Leader has his team of leadersthe young explorers are divided into

from the parent's point of viewBy MARY KEENNEGOTIATING a holiday for teenagers is extremely delicate workTears though thankfully no bloodhave been shed in our house trying to reconcile demands for freedomadventure and excitement with worries over healthsafety and expenseThe result for our three daughters has been French and Italian exchangesEurorailingand country holidays in England or IrelandLast yearwith her sisters now undergraduates17-year-old Clare was our chief concernOne spring evening we had been out to dinner and came back to find Clare bounding downstairs with excitementI'm going on an expedition to Borneoshe saidIt will be for a month this summerI can't believe my luckReallyI saidplaying for timeWill it be with the Student Communist Party or Opus Deiboth risks springing to the mind of a parent living in an ancient university cityWith World Challenge Expeditions if I pass the interviewAs the selection process hinged upon the spoken word I knew she'd be chosenWorld Challenge Expeditions meant nothing to usIts brochure promised amazing adventure in distant places BorneoIndiaSouth America costing about £2,500The Borneo trip might have been designed to match Clare's wildest dreamsbut it undoubtedly involved real riskA group of teenagers with two team leaders were to survive the rigours of a difficult climate while trekking through remote jungle and mountain areas with their possessions on their back and only their fellow expedition members to rely onThe organisation's credentials and experience looked impressivebut our anxieties were genuine as we sent Clare off for her interviewHoweverWorld Challenge has a way with worried parentsClare was let off the residential weekend which is a normal part of the selection process and was taken on the strength of her interview and written applicationOnce acceptedshe received detailed instructions for a fitness training programmeinformation on injections and medications needed and a pithy list of dos and don'tsThey recommended equipment and had a discount arrangement with the mail order company Field and Trekwhose advice was excellent and whose rucksack proved a boonOur respect for the organisation grewWe went to a reception to meet fellow members of the team and the leadersThese were two ex-marinesone of whom had led the trek the previous year and who answered endless questionsWe also met the organisersAs ex-Servicementhey had not only dealt with the situations I feared mostbut also those I could not imagineAfter Clare's six weeks of personal fitness training at homeas recommended by the marinesthe day came to deliver her to Easthampstead Park for the 36-hour preparation period before the flight to BorneoAgaineverything was done to reassure usWe had coffee with the team members and their families and saw a slide-show of last year's tripPassportstravellers' cheques and malaria pills were all checkedOne of the organisersCharles Rigbyput the whole thing into proportion as I was anxiously sorting out with Clare a second name for the next-of-kin slot at the back of her passportIt's a wonderful thing that they're all here and all OKhe saidOne of the team members of our Nepal expedition had to drop out yesterdayHe'd picked up dysentery at a game fair in HampshireA month later we all met again at London AirportClare looked incredibly fit and had had a wonderful timeShe is saving for another tripprobably in an informal group of friendsThe advantage of having trekked with a World Challenge Expedition is that another time she will know how things ought to be plannedTheir treks cost a lot of moneybut strike a good balance between looking after people and keeping planning flexible enough to take advantage of unforeseen opportunitieson the Borneo trip some of them camped by a waterfall andinstead of eating dried provisionscooked a deer shot by one of their guidesThe calibre of the expedition leaders ensures that these young travellers are able to complete trips that would be too complicated to organise for themselvesMy conclusion is that if your teenager has the temperament and enthusiasm for an expedition type of holidayand if your purse will stretch to ityou should go for it but choose the organisation carefullyTravelThe great beyond Richard Snailham surveys organised adventure schemes for young peopleBy RICHARD NAILHAMArcturus

its reputation for fine engineeringRolls-Royce has never been shy of using outside technology and componentsinevitable now for a company of its small sizeThe current models use a General Motors automatic transmission with R-R's own finger-light electric selectorand German-made electronic engine management systems and anti-lock brakingWhich would I prefer to ownAs pure driving machinesthere is no real comparison the Mercedes is streets aheadDespite its bulk and weightit handles like a much smaller carIts performance is formidablein this contexta fairer comparison would be with the Bentley Turbo R from the Rolls-Royce stableBut at the end of the daysuperb machine though it isthe Mercedes is still just another Mercedes one of more than half-a-million produced annuallyall bearing the famous silver starSo if you want to be noticedand enjoy a more exclusive sense of well-beingthere is still nothing like a RollsAlthough the boy racers may jeerit is still a very pleasant car to driveas wellBut they are both just too big for everyday useMotoringCan R-R keep up with the timesJohn Langley asks whether the best car in the worldhas any sort of futureBy JOHN LANGLEYTWENTY-ONE years agoRolls-Royce Ltd went bustand the nation shudderedDeveloping the new RB211 aero engine had proved too much for the world-famous engineering group's financial resourcesThe collapse was not directly linked to the motor car sidebut it threatened the cars' futureSo we all swelled with pride whena fortnight laterthe car company went ahead with the launch of its new Corniche coupe in the South of FranceSince thenRolls-Royce Motorsthe new public company formed two years later from the ashes of the parent grouphas successfully re-established itself in its own rarefied niche at the top of the world's luxury car marketEven those who did not endorse the company's claim to produce The Best Car in the Worldwere prepared to give it the benefit of the doubtBut now there is a new battle for the body and soul of Rolls-RoyceOnce againthe car company is in trouble and some are questioning its futureFrom record profits of about £34 million and near-record sales of 3,333 cars in 1990the car business turned in a loss of about £60 million last year as worldwide sales dropped to 1,731dragging down the profits of the parent groupVickersThe setback has led to new speculation about a take-over or co-operative deal with BMWToyotaGeneral Motors and othersThere are suggestions that Rolls-Royce may be unable to fund the cost of the new modeldue out in the next few yearsand that Vickers will not be able to carry the burden much longerMore ominouslysome are now asking whether the days are numbered for the last of the Edwardian motor cars Rolls-Royce was founded in Manchester in 1904 and whether cars of this sizeweight and cost can really be justified in an era of increased social awareness and growing environmental concernsHoweverboth Sir David Plastowthe Vickers chairmanand Peter Wardthe Rolls-Royce Motors chairman and chief executiveinsist that the gloom has been overdone and that structural changes introduced in the last year have made the company leaner and more efficientThe introduction of Japanese-style working practices at Crewe is said to have brought the break-even point down from sales of about 2,700 cars a year to about 2,000Even sosome analysts question whether the company can finance a new model costingperhaps£250 million without outside helpSir Davidwho piloted Rolls-Royce Motors back to success after the 71 crash and who is due to retire next monthsaysIt depends how we do it there are so many ways of developing a new Rolls-RoyceWe are under no pressure to do anything immediatelyWe are not anxious to sell the companybut we are in discussion with a variety of people about co-operation and prospective linkages of various sortsPeter Ward agreesPeople are not walking away from the carWe knew we would get a big loss this year partly because of the cost of the changes we have madeNowwith sales of around 2,600 cars a yearwe could actually make the same profits as we did in 1990 with 3,300 salesBut one insider who believes more radical changes will be needed is the erstwhile engineering directorMichael Dunnwho resigned this week to join an engineering consultancy groupDunn was brought in from Fordwhere he was director of product development in 1983he will be best remembered for the development of the Bentley Turbo Rnow the company's best-selling modelHe did the engineering for the new Rollsbut is believed to have felt that a smallerlighter and more economical new car should have been developedHe says that surgery rather than an aspirinwas requiredespecially at the top of the companyIs there a future for the Rolls-RoyceIs it still the Best Car in the WorldI asked himI never say it's the best car in the worldhe repliedbut I believe we are the best at making a car in our classThere is a future for Rolls-RoyceThe challenge is to produce a car which is more attractive to more people and costs less to makeand to minimise or eliminate any social embarrassment in running oneThere is a change in social awarenessWe have to make better use of material resourceswith lighter and more efficient carsIt has to be seen to be more socially responsibleto make people feel more comfortable about owning a RollsAlthough the fuel economy has improved by around 30 per cent over the past decadethere is evidence that the younger generationin particularfeels the car is too ostentatious in today's environmentDunn believes the company has failed to put across the significant improvements made in the new car's fuel economyreduced emissions and extra safetyAnd he saysI don't think Rolls-Royce buyers want a small carThey want space and they would expect it to be one of the bigger carsBut we could well encounter sales resistance if it is the biggestThe main need is to minimise weightNowwith the demands for fuel economycarbon dioxide emissions and toxic emissionspeople will be taking extreme measures to reduce weightSo does Rolls-Royce still have a credible future with or without outside helpThe success of the new Continental Rand before that the Bentley Turboshows that if it can make the sort of car that new customers approve ofit should still be able to find 3,000 buyers a year around the worldBut even Rolls-Royce must be seen to be moving with the timesThat will certainly mean a slightly smallerlighter car with an engine of less than the present 6.75 litresMotoringRough ride back to to the roaring '40sBy DAVID TAYLORMY MOTORING seems to be bobbing about through a series of time warpslike Dr Who in his TardisI had hardly finished rummaging through my snapshots of cars of the '50s pictured here a fortnight agowhen I was transported back another 10 years to the 1940sHere and there it felt more like the Middle AgesWhat brought all this on was driving from Berlin to Leipzig and backI've been known to moan about the state of some of the roads in our neck of the Surrey woodsbut the byways of darkest Saxony make my local rutted tracks seem smooth as glassWhen you have one wheel stuck in bent tramlines while the other is banging through mud-filledcobble-strewn potholes the size of small mineshaftsit sharpens up your steering technique no endA year or so ago I motored for the fun of it through Latvia and Estoniafrom Riga to what was then still Leningradand never thought to encounter such ramshackle roads againBut nearly half a century of neglect has left the former DDR's network in a no less lamentable state of collapseThey're working on itbut there are about 50,000 kilometres of roads in all and I was told that fully half of them need to be torn up and rebuilt from scratchUnfortunatelyit appeared to be the same half that I had picked to exploreAnd joining me on the journey was a never-ending line of lumbering construction plantBrobdingnagian

of the roaring '40s was more in evidence on the Berlin-to-Leipzig Autobahnroute No 1That was built by Hitler andby the look of itlong stretches of its concrete had hardly been touched sinceDeserted watchtowers on stilts loom over major intersectionsI passed a military truck in the hedgeFilling stationsrest roomsor any other signs of roadside life can be 50 or more bleak kilometres apartThenjust as I'd half a mind to twiddle with the radio in case Marlene Dietrich was still onthere would be another lurch of the Tardis-like mood and I'd come upon a garishly-lit motelfreshly shipped across from the Westor else be smartly overtaken by a monstrous new Mercedes doing 200 kph or more with effortless abandonat least until the next plunge into potholes and waterlogged screeCentral Leipzig presented a similarly surreal mixture of eager aspirations and a down-at-heel recent pastShiny new BMWs were lined up for sale on the forecourt of what I took to be a condemned block of woefully austere flatswith a dilapidated factory next doorI was carved up by a let-me-through Porschewith a chap at the wheel chatting into his Deutsche Telekom mobile phoneand then caught up with the car again a few kilometres further onwhere it had slithered on the wet cobbles and collided with an antique tramLater I turned and walloped back towards Berlinby way of Magdeburgwith just the one tweak of the Tardis en route as I saw the signs for PotsdamNext day I was thrashing along the Kingston bypass againThe traffic queue into London stretched back milesfor a sewer had collapsed in the centre of Wandsworth and gangs of workmen were tearing up the shattered roadapparently rebuilding it from scratchI sang Lili Marlene to myself as I inched past the concrete-mixers and lorries full of

private eatermost decent restaurants were cluttered up with expense-account company clodhoppersmaking maximum use of their up-market luncheon vouchersBut nowadays there's more elbow room and less cigar smoke and the shrewder restaurateurs have set out to replace their lost business regulars by constructing lunch menus that are brieflight and designed to show off the chef's talents rather than the customer's credit ratingit's hard to believe that anyone can produce a good meal so cheaplyOften the set lunches are so cheapin factthat they work as a loss leader a taster to tempt people back in the eveningAnd in a well-run establishment the leisurely lunch can actually be more fun than dinner the kitchen is under less pressurethe room is less crowded and less smokyEven at the very top of the market there are amazing bargainsThree courses may cost almost £100but when the cooking is done by masters like Nico Ladenis or Pierre Koffmann this is real value for money and barely half the evening

unsung corners of the worldand began to round up the usual suspects CyprusIsraelCanadaBelgiumMy interest in whether they were making much progress towards the glorious flavours beginning to arrive from AustraliaNew Zealand and Southern America was only somewhat tempered by a certain nervousness on behalf of my liver and my headThen I went through the samples in my kitchen and realised thatrather than look at the non-mainstream areasI could look at wines from perfectly accepted areas that broke the usual conventionsor in one brilliant exampleI could see what great traditional winemakers in this case a pair of Burgundian grandees could do when they decided to rough it a bit in France's far southThis wine is so goodlet's deal with it straight awayDomaine de Triennes is a new venture in the Mediterranean Var region from the chap who makes Domaine de la Romanee-Conti wines and the chap who makes Domaine DujacThe Pinot Noir is their Burgundy red grapebut at Domaine de Triennes they've planted the Bordeaux grape Cabernet and the Rhone grape Syrahand the result is explosively goodpacked with pepper and spicea deep lush damson and blackberry fruit and a light swish of sweet leatherThe Australians often use this grape combinationbut they would be hard put to equal this quality for £4.65Corney & Barrow sell it from 12 Helmet RowLondonEC1tel071 251 4051For this 1990 vintage they had the outstanding winemaker from Martinborough in New Zealand working thereNowI wonder if that made a differenceAnd talking of unexpected wine stylesAustralia has made something of a speciality of mixing Bordeaux Semillon grape with Burgundy's Chardonnay grape recentlyAustralian Chardonnay has become so popular they have been suffering shortagesbut there has always been loads of Semillon availableSo the Aussies blend them together andwhen they apply a little oak ageing toothe result is a lovely fat winemildly spicybut with a streak of limeYet no-one else in the world had even considered such a blendcertainly not the CaliforniansThat isuntil one of Penfold's Australian winemakers poled up at Geyser Peak winery in California and realised the price of Chardonnay was so high around the Sonoma Valley he'd never manage to make a £4.99 class white for our marketGoing back to his Aussie rootshe remembered the role Semillon played down therebut good Semillon is virtually non-existent in CaliforniaExcept in one areaSouth of San Franciscohemmed in by housing developments and shopping mallsthe ancient Livermore Valley vineyards survive by the skin of their grapesAnd on these gravelly soilsthe Semillon flourishes just as it does in BordeauxSemchard Oddbins£4.99I knowI don't like the name either is 75 per cent Livermore Semillon and the rest Sonoma Chardonnaythe flavour is quite unlike anything from California or AustraliaThere is a lovely smell of apricot and cinnamon spicea light but extremely attractive dry texture and the same gentleapproachable apricot and cinnamon tasteIt's more like a modern white Bordeaux than anything elseSuch a pity Chardonnay is banned in BordeauxAnd I must admit I was pleasantly surprised to find Burgundy's Pinot Noir taking ever firmer root in GermanyThe Baden region is well to the south of Germany's more famous wine areasand so receives far more sunshinegiving the growers greater flexibility in what kinds of wine they can makeBecause Germany's reputation was created by the Riesling wines of the Mosel and Rheingau areasthere has always been a sniffy attitude to the southSniff no moreBaden is undergoing the same transformation that is revitalising southern FranceTesco's Baden Pinot Noir £3.99has all the delightful gentle fruit flavours of the Pinot soft strawberry and fresh pear but it is assertive enough to boast a pretty deep colour and a nip of tanninAnd one more remarkable transplantThe Alsace tradition of making a fragrant dry Muscat has been gaining ground in southern Franceand of all places in IsraelIsraeli winesapart from the expensive Golan Heights wineshave generally been pretty poor thicksweetishover-ripe and a million miles away from thirst-quenchingSo I was staggered to open Baron Wine Cellars' Dry Muscat and find a wine fizzing with sherbert-sharp freshnessIt is dry and it is almost aggressively refreshing great starbursts of lime juice and orange peel and just a little

DAVISthe defending championlost his quarter-final clash with Ken Doherty in the most humiliating circumstances when he forfeited the deciding frame and the match on the missrule at the Benson and Hedges Irish Masters at Goff'sCounty KildareDavis failed to make contact with either of two clearly visible reds in three attempts when leading 37–36 in the ninth frame and thus allowed Doherty safe passage into today's semi-finalsAlthough warned by referee John Street of the consequences of a further missafter two failuresDavis still could not hit either of the two balls and thus became the most notable victim of the controversial ruleIf the meticulous Davis was the last player one would expect to lose in such a mannerthe six-times Masters champion retained his reputation for sportsmanship by the grace with which he accepted the verdictRules are ruleshe saidand you have to abide by themI was well aware of what would happen and I just have to accept itDoherty's opponent in today's semi-final is Mike Halletta surprise 5–1 winner over Jimmy Whitewhose recent form deserted him in a lacklustre performance when he could compile only one break of more than 30 compared to four by

crew around has a message stuck to its windscreenprobably more for the benefit of its occupants than as an exhortation to other motoristsJust Do Itit saysThis could be the year they dothough they say that around the Cam every year and have been wrong for 15 of the last 16Listening to John Wilsonthe Cambridge coachthoughthe idea does grow that Oxford's run of consecutive victories currently five is about to end and that Cambridge will lift the trophy provided by Beefeaterthe sponsorsfor the first timeThere is not a shred of doubt in my mind that we will winhe saysI think we are at least as strong as the Oxford crew physically and we have more experiencethough the ages of the crews are almost identicalWe row technically better and in a more efficient wayFor all his obvious biasWilson has a better overview of the race than mostLast year he was coach to OxfordThey will have a confidence that they will win on the dayhe concedesThey always have an ability to get the best out of the crew on the dayBut CambridgeWilson insistsare not imbued with the loser's mentalityYou get different people each yearhe saysThey are almost all from winning schools and programmes and are used to successWe are the underdogs but that's not how we see itThe desire of the Cambridge Boat Club to win this year began the evening they lost last yearWe have got the best-trained Cambridge squad there has ever beenfitter and more technically ableWe have been more thorough in our approach to training and developing our techniqueThey have also made more use of video analysisThe best coach is the athlete looking at what he is doingsays WilsonWilson grew up in rowingrather than the Boat Racehaving been born at HenleyHe modestly describes his competitive career as not particularly specialthough he was good enough to winin an eighta silver medal in the world under-23 championships of 1983A back injury effectively ended his career seven years agoHe immediately took to coachingaiding the scullerCarl Smithto the world championship in 1986and has already had three successful years with the Nottinghamshire County clubHe has also taken quickly to the Boat RaceIf you ran a mile raceyou would go off fairly quickly then settle at an even pace before building up towards the endIf you did that in the Boat Race you would get left behindIt is like running the first 100 metres like Carl Lewisgetting into gear but pushing really hard for the whole race as you go alongIt's not the most efficient way to do itThen you have got the tactics of finding the right streamgetting the right cover from the windIt is a battle to press your opponents until they concede mentallyYou pressurisepressurisepressurise until finally they don't think they can win the raceThenwhen they don't think they can win the racethey can'tIt is clear the event has Wilson in its gripdespite his being associated with it for only two yearsI will be devastated if we don't winhe admitsFor both the universitesit's the only race of the year that really mattersIf you don't win the Boat Raceit might be a good year otherwise but it's not really a good yearMotor RacingMansell produces masterly displayBy Timothy Collings in Sao PauloNIGEL MANSELL produced one of the most masterly qualifying drives of his 12-year Formula One career here yesterday as he claimed provisional pole position for tomorrow's Brazilian Grand

question is whether Cambridge's skill will be enough to overcome Oxford's greater punchIn recent yearsthe punch has wonCambridge have shown themselves to be fast starters but Bangert has sometimes lacked the rhythm to capitalise on an early leadwhile Oxfordthough led in practice raceshave rowed strong opponents downOxford expect to be led but must keep in touchIt is easier to visualise Oxford

considerable Tideway experiencewhile Elizabeth Chickthe third woman to steer for Oxfordhas also impressed in practiceOxford remain marginal favourites but Cambridge have a slight weight advantage and

scienceBy AUBERON WAUGHTHE more scientists write to The Times threatening to vote Labour unless we give them huge sums of moneythe more many of us feel it is time to call a halt to scienceIf Labour wins the electionI imagine all scientists will emigrate anywaybut a new Conservative government should give serious thought to my proposal for deporting any research scientist who asks for government moneyRecently we read in this newspaper how two remarkable new numbershad been discovered by Atomic Energy Authority scientists using a super computer at the Harwell laboratoryThe first was the biggest prime number227,832 digits longenough to fill nearly six pages of The Daily TelegraphThe otherwhich is a new perfect numberwas 455,633 digits longable to occupy more than 12 pages of The Daily TelegraphPeople complain about City prices and Leicester University class listsbut if we started printing all these digits even our most faithful readers would complainI wonder how much money we taxpayers paid for these completely useless pieces of informationI myselfrecently playing with a calculatordiscovered the only number whichlike the number oneis its own square root but whichunlike the number oneis not its own squareThe answer is 0.9 recurringbut I do not expect to be awarded great sums of public money for this discoverywhich I freely give to the worldnor do I demand the overthrow of government and its takeover by a gang of lower-class hooligansThe real reason why scientists should be seen as a menace is that they have reduced all our savingsour pensions' prospectsour records

GrahamTHE SENIOR Daughter is about to leave homeWe've been together now for 18 years and it don't seem a day too longbut I can see there does come a time when it's good for mother and child to view one another from a distanceThat time is now upon usI was 19 when I left home and went to universityI tumbled out of the nestwhere I'd been a cosseted only childand into digsThey turned out to be very nice digsbut I was still facedfor the first time in my lifewith the practicalities of keeping myself fed and clothedand getting to lectures and passing examsFranklyI didn't have a clueI didn't make any enquiries about how the laundry got done until the day I ran out of clean tightsMy catering was limited to brewing endless mugs of insipid coffee and opening packets of custard creamsBut I got byIn factwithin two years I had gone to the other extremewashing shorts for lads who were old enough to do it for themselvesand baking cakes for the sole purpose of giving them awayIt was as though playing in the Wendy House was something I had to do before I could settle to weightier mattersI vowed that my children would be better prepared when they left homeFrom an early age I expected them to do things for themselvesand sometimes for meand when they snivelled about their friends having kind and conscientious mothers who changed their sheets and made fruit piesI said Some daywhen you're at Sunderland Polytechnic and living by your witsyou'll thank meWellthe Senior Daughter isn't going to Sunderland to studyShe's going to Italy to be a Mother's HelpNo sooner had the news leaked out than my telephone started ringingI was in a fever of vicarious excitementlooking at street plans of Florence and trying to remember the name of a boy I'd met in the Boboli Gardens in 1961but friends and relations were wanting to know whether I had really vetted the familywhether I'd like to hear a selection of au pair horror storiesand whether I'd made good any gaps in my daughter's domestic skillsI've relied on someone else to do the vettingApparently the family is not related to the Borgiasat leastnot to any seriously worrying BorgiasAnd we have talked about some of the extra-curricular activities that pretty young girls sometimes get invited to tryI've seen enough middle-aged English husbands getting pink and sweaty over Scandinavian au pairs to know that lust can be an occupational hazardWhich just leaves her domestic credentials to knock into shapeand now that they're under scrutiny I realise I've not done a very good job at allI saidI think you should know how to cook a few thingsin case they ask you to feed the childrenbut she seemed to think that knowing how to make a Marmite sandwich would be enoughI pressed onThey probably don't have Marmite in ItalyI could see her working out how many jars she'd be able to carry in her hand luggageI asked my friends who have had au pairs what they'd expected of them in the kitchenOne of themrecently relieved of a large Norwegian and still visibly tensesaid she'd lost interest in food and would settle for not having all the cup handles knocked offAnothera veteran who's been sorting out homesick Latins for yearssaid it was the greatest treatonce in a whileto get them to cook something just-a like-a Mama used to makeThat's the thingshe saidSend her off with some traditional British recipes under her beltSo the problem is greater than I had first thoughtShe can't cookshe doesn't especially want to learn to cookand I have only the sketchiest notion of British cookingI could show her a bit of IndianChinese or Middle Easternall heavily adaptedbecause I like messing around with other people's culinary canonsbut mainly I'd have to show her my version of Italianand the liberties I've taken with that don't bear repetitionNot in Tuscanyat any rateTo show willing she has watched while I've prepared dinner this weekI think she's picked up a few pointerslike how to chop an onion and how to dissolve an Oxo cubeI was going to tell her about proper beef stockbut the girl has to walk before she can runHer repertoire now consists of Pasta with Meat SaucePasta with Tomato Sauceand Pasta with Onions but No SauceIf Yorkshire Pudding ever catches on over there it won't be any fault of mineNext week we're going to do omelettesand how to say Please take your hand off my bottomAnd if time permits we might do the

had robbed us of Voyage to the Bottom of the Seaour weekly TV fixI shall never get used to the changing of the clocksLike middle agethis takes me unawaresfor even when I have noticed that single paragraph on the front page of newspapersI still can't work out what is happeningI lie awaketrying to remember whether the clocks go forward or backand what this means in terms of daylight or the day beforeAll I knowlike the protestors when the Julian became the Gregorian calendaris that I must have missed somethingEither the afternoons are as endless as those in old folks' homeswhich prompt the matrons to pin up Reality Orientation charts When is your birthdayWhat are the names of your childrenor night comes so abruptly it is as though someone has pulled down a blindWhatever happensI always seem to end up watching The South Bank Showsomething I never do normallythe changing of the clocks is forever associated with the Arts and adenoidsI know there are other irreconcilables out there somewhereMy father told me of an old lady who to the end of her days referred to Amser Duw ac amser Lloyd GeorgeGod's time and Lloyd George's timefor when the change was introduced during the Great Warthere was chaosThe towns accepted the new timebut not the country areasFarmers argued that as their day already began at sunrisethey would gain nothing and would also lose an hour for their workers insisted on finishing at the same time as town dwellersThey refused to alter their clocksSo in the same villagethere would be two different sorts of timePost officesrailway stations and schools had the newand the rest the oldin the cottages there was friction as children and their fathers turned up for meals at different timesThe womenas usualbore the brunt of itfor everyone stayed up latechildren refused to go to bed at night and men would not get up in the morningIt must have been the most bewildering social change since the Enclosuresand yet I can find no reference to it in the village School LogOf course they got used to itjust as they got used to the closing of the railwaythe death of the last squirethe demolition of the hallthe theft of the common landThe story of a village iscontrary to popular beliefone of continual changeWhich is why I find myself brooding over an extraordinary view taken from the airSuch photographs are very popularand Parish Clerk Weekley has one which shows him sitting on his own roofUsually they get taken from 100ft upbut the one I have is a little differentIt was taken 300 miles upfrom a satelliteA town like Towcester is a little larger than my thumbnailthe M1 is a hairline fractureand the only piece of geometry anywhere is the remorseless straight lineseen from spaceof the old Roman Watling StreetThe scale is 1–75,000the photograph is 20 ins by 16 inchesand its detail amazingI can see fields and reservoirs and a motorway service stationandgiven the proper magnificationI could probably make out Parish Clerk Weekley still on his roof waiting for his next photocallUntil I was lent thisI had not realised it was possible for members of the public to get their hands on such thingsYou buy them from the Nigel Press Associates of Edenbridge in Kenta print this size costs £60This presumably restricts their popularityespecially as no farmer is going to want one when his yard is the size of a blackheadYet apparently members of the public are beginning to buy these pictureswhich were previously bought only by geologists and oil companiesI think they do so for peace of mindFor this is the earth as no bird has ever seen itand no man from any planeIn this small pictureyou look down on a couple of hundred thousand people and their bodies are as invisible as microbesYou are as distant from their worries and their rows as any angelLookyou can just make out their bypasses and their parkstheir racecourses and their research establishmentsAt this height the street plans of their towns look like writhing maggotsand a puff of cloud conceals an entire farmAll human activity seems so pettyYou can forgive them anything from this perspectiveyou can almost forgive them for changing the clocks
