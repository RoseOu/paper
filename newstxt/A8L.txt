A Country DiaryCROOKCoDURHAMThese are the quiet days before winterFor most of this week the landscape has been draped on shifting fog patchesOn some days the top of Pea Hill has been bathed in brilliant sunshinewhile the valley of the River Wear ahead has been awash in a sea of greywith tentacles of fog creeping outwards along hedges and gulleys into fieldsWe have yet to experience any hard frostsso autumn leaves still cling to branches and there are still a few flowers of white dead nettlered campion and yarrow to attract the last of the drone fliesHedgerows take on an additional dimension on foggy dayswhen the distant landscape is blotted out immediate surroundings assume a new prominenceHundreds of spiders' webssuspended between twigs bearing yellowing leaves and clusters of scarlet rose hips are decorated with water droplets that sparkle in the weak sun that occasionally penetrates the murkAmongst the dead hogweed umbels and seed heads of willow herb there are clusters of ladybirdspacked into tight groups in every available creviceLadybirds have done well out of the exceptional summeras have sweet chestnut treesthis is the first year that I can recall collecting chestnuts locally that are large enough to eatThe warmth and mildness has brought a fine crop of toadstoolsThe most spectacular of these have been some magnificent specimens of Verdigris agaricStroparia aeruginosashown to me by Maureen Deftya local farmerThey had sprouted from buried wood in the vegetable garden and sported livid blue-greenslimy capsWe had our first moderate snow fall in mid-November last yearbut so far it looks as though this winter will be milder than everOne sign of approaching winter comes from the parties of siskins feeding on catkins of birch seedsmoving from tree to tree in noisy flocksPHIL GATESDiaryBy Andrew MoncurA STRANGE silence from the Government the people who brought you the Spycatcher saga as a book goes into printgiving the inside story of
