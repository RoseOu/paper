oddshe saved the mutinous General Raoul Salan head of the Organisation de L'Armee Secretefrom an expected death sentence for treasonWith his deep voicecrumpled facehuge nose and ears and streak of crueltyMaitre Tixier-Vignancour willingly symbolised all that was most demonic about France's extreme rightAfter a brilliant student career at the Sorbonne he was called to the Paris Bar in 1926He started in political life as he meant to go onsympathising with Action Francaiseand making his first political gesture at the age of 26 as one of the threateningright-wing mob who were driven back by police gunfire when they tried to storm the Chamber of Deputies in February 1934In July 1940following France's military defeat and occupation by the German armyTixier-Vignancour was one of the majority of deputies who abolished the Third Republic and voted plenary powers to Marshal PetainHe was appointed to the post of Deputy Secretary-General of Informationin the Vichy regime but resigned in January 1941He was briefly interned by the Germans in Tunisthen liberated by the AmericansHe ended the War holding both the Croix de Guerre and the petainiste decorationthe francisqueIn 1945 he was arrested by the new government and tried for collaboratingThis charge could not be proved but the military tribunal condemned him to 10 years absence from public lifeTixier-Vignancour emerged from this period of enforced reflection with a deep loathing for General de Gaulle and when he returned to politics in 1955 he was one of the architects of the revival of the extreme rightusing the popular cause of Algerie Francaiseas a rallying pointWhen those who fomented civil war in Algeria were brought to trialTixier-Vignancour was the natural choice to defend themFour of his clients were executedincluding Lt Degueldrehead of the Delta Commando and Col Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry who nearly succeeded in blowing up General de Gaulle and his wife at Petit-Clamart in 1962As their advocateTixier-Vignancour had to accompany these four officers to the firing squadthus witnessing a fate which might have been his own in 1945He was appalled by the experienceHe subsequently popularised his political movementthe Rassemblement Nationalwith the memorable slogan Against de Gaulle and CommunismDuring the treason trials Tixier-Vignancour became notorious for a tactic known as the defence of blackmailwhen he repeatedly threatened to call eminent witnesses such as General de Gaulle and the Prime Minister Michel Debrehinting that they too were involved in criminal plotsHe pulled this trick once too often against Debreand was horrified one morning to see the Prime Minister sitting in the witness boxwaiting to be cross-examinedSince Tixier-Vignancour did not actually have any questions to ask him he decided to bluff it out to the endYou are Michel Debrehe said in his most sardonic tonesThat is correct'You are even more menacinglythe Prime Minister of France'Yes'Long pauseThank-you very muchNo more questionsEnd of the defence of blackmailTixier-Vignancour's success in retricting General Salan's punishment to life imprisonment in 1968 so angered President de Gaulle that he considered resignationBy then Tixierhad taken his anti-Gaullist crusade to the point of running himself as a presidential candidateWithout any proper party organisation he fought a brilliant campaign in 1965canvassing the French throughout August on every beach from Dunkirk to MentonHe was eliminated in the first roundcoming fourth behind de GaulleMitterrand and Jean LecanuetHe promptly consigned his five per cent of the vote to Mr Mitterrand in the second rounda gift whch the Socialist candidate happily acceptedWith the death of Tixier-Vignancour a distinctive line of French politicians seems to have come to an endIt can be traced directly back to the anti-Dreyfusard cause of the late nineteenth centuryTixier-Vignancour declined to be described as anti-semitiche once sued Sam White of the Evening Standard for calling him thisbut he was in no danger of winning a righteous gentileawardHis political heirs include Jean Marie Le Penleader of the Front Nationaland the left-wing advocate Maitre Jacques Verges who attempted to revive the defence of blackmailduring the 1987 trial of the SS officer Klaus BarbieBut neither of them can match the pungency of the originalan atmosphere of beaujolaiscigars and malevolenceand of political or legal plots being brewed in the all-night brasseries of Les HallesTixier-Vignancour's declared hobby was collecting lead soldiersObituaryVirgil ThomsonBy PETER DICKINSONVIRGIL THOMSON was a composer and writer of originalitycourage and wit formed by a unique mixture of American and French influencesThomson was born in Kansas City in 1896studied at Harvardand then mostly lived in Paris until 1940His Missouri childhood gave him access to Baptist hymns and church musicbut at Harvard he was introduced to the writings of Gertrude Stein and the music of Erik SatieThese influences laid the foundations for the blend of the naive and the sophisticated which is the hallmark of Thomson's maturityLike many young American composers he studied with Nadia Boulangerbut after 1925 set out to achieve the discipline of spontaneitywhich he found in Stein's writingsWhen he collaborated directly with her in opera the result was of historical significanceFirst came Four Saints in Three Actsproduced in 1934and then The Mother of Us All 1947which demonstrated a new kind of plotless opera only now reaching a wider currency through the stage works of Philip GlassIn Four Saints Thomson's informality was given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano thenwhen it stuckwrote it down to a figured bassHe saidI had wondered whether a piece so drenched in Anglican chant running from Gilbert and Sullivan to Morning Prayer and backcould rise and sailBut the resulting mixture of hymnsfolksy tunes and recitatives at times of intoxicating banality was a sensationThe operalike Gershwin's Porgy and Bess the following yearused an all-Black cast and the staging and choreography gave it a British connection since it was by Frederick AshtonThe Mother of Us All shows more continuitybut again much depends upon production in what is still a largely non-narrative operaIn 1936three years before Aaron CoplandThomson started writing film scores which were a model of unobtrusive clarity and pertinencecombining American materials to suit documentaries such as The Plow that Broke the Plains and The River with the musique d'ameublement approach of SatieHis score for the film Louisiana Story was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1948Another response to a visual stimulus was Thomson's series of musical portraits of people such as Picasso and Aaron CoplandThe first of these was written in 1928 and they number about 150Just as Thomson transferred Stein's literary abstraction to musicso these portraits unusually employ the painter's technique of drawing the sitter from lifean ideal combination of Thomson's habit of immediate response with an actual subjectThe results are terse and sharply etchedlike the best line drawingsThomson could control words with the same fastidiousness as notesHe always felt that effective musical criticism began by being well writtenand he never lost his livelinessOne never quite knew what he was going to say nextHe started by writing occasional articles but in 1939 he wrote The State of Musica trenchant and provocative assessment of the machinery of the musical profession at the timeFrom 1940 to 1954 he wrote regularly for the New York Herald Tribune and four volumes of his notices have appeared in book formHe wrote a fulsome 400-page autobiographycharacteristically entitled Virgil Thomson on Virgil Thomsonand a personal surveyAmerican Music since 1910appeared in 1972followed recently by a selected edition of his lettersAs both composer and critic he touched both sides of the coinA climate of receptivity is what the artist most desiresIt is also a thing that even the most experienced reviewer cannot always offerThomson's judgements about music were not always as accurate as his confident expression impliedhe invited discussionAbove all he restored the focus of music criticism onto the music itselfHe made no secret of his Francophile enthusiasmsin reaction to the earlier domination of American music by Germansand he was one of the first writers to register the importance of jazzHe fearlessly attacked conventionwhich caused problems when he pitched into established reputationsIt has become increasingly apparent that Thomson belonged to the American experimental traditionHe anticipated some of the enthusiasms of John Cagewhom he first met in 1941A few years later Thomson recognised Cage as the most original composer in Americaif not the worldand Cage repaid the compliment by writing the works section of a monograph on ThomsonBut finallyin spite of their common roots in Satie and SteinThomson felt that Cage's aesthetic was destructiveThomson's songs contain some of his finest workThere are Stein settingssuch asPortrait of FBbut also cycles such as Five Songs from William BlakePrayers and Praises and a cantata based on poems by Edward LearThomson was also prolific in instrumental music on both chamber and solo scaleFor many years Thomson lived in New York in his apartment at the Chelsea HotelFrom therelike a buzzard in its eyriehe would make forays round the US and abroad in spite of his advanced ageHe seemed a genial and indestructible landmark in the history of American musicin spite of defective hearing which had bothered him since the late SeventiesHe had a photograph of himself on his postcards and he signed his letters following the original tailpiece everbestThomson came from a generation of American composers which had to find its own way without benefit of university patronageIn that kind of free market he thrived and survived and so will the best of his workObituaryThomas KellerBy HUGH MATHESONTHOMI KELLER is the outstanding figure in the history of international rowingHe was President of FISA Federation Internationale des Societes d'Avironthe world governing bodyfor 30 yearsand most of this body's attitudes and practices reflect the force of his strictbut genial personalityMost athletes first encountered him as a voicebellowing in multi-lingual fury at officials who had broken rules or arrangements designed to make racing safer or more fairHe was elected to succeed Gaston Mullegg as President of FISA when he was 33 and still competing in the Swiss rowing teamHe did not loosen his links with the athletes when projected upwards into the PresidencyProvided their behaviour was sportsmanlike and safeoarsmen found only encouragement and humour from a President who was always among themKeller's Zurich upbringing made him into a skiier and scullerand he raced for the Grasshopper clubHe competed for the Swiss cross-country and ski-jumping team at the Student Winter Games and later concentrated on single scullsIn 1950he was Swiss sculls champion and finished third in the European championships before moving to Manila to work for his family's private multinational companyEduard Keller Ltdfor four yearsOn his returnKeller was Swiss champion again in 1955 and was bitterly disappointed when the Swiss chose to boycott the 1956 Olympics after the Russian intervention in HungaryFISA was then a relatively unimportant body which organised European and other championships and participated in the running of Olympic regattasAs a richforceful young manKeller had been earmarked as a likely future presidenteven before Mullegg was killed in an aircrash in 1958Rowing was transformed in the breadth and depth of participation over the 30 years of his termHe sat on the appropriate boards of the International Olympic Committee and was President of the General Assembly of International Sports Federations for 17 yearsThese positions were not held for his own status but to promote the cause of rowing where it needed cloutHe successfully defended rowing as an Olympic sport and in 1976 introduced women's eventswhich have now expanded to six classesHis personal preference for sculling over rowing assisted the introduction of quadruple sculls to world championship and Olympic competitionKeller was made a Steward of Henley Royal Regatta in 1976a time when the proliferation of new six-lanestill-water courses around the worldwhich had emerged under his guidanceseemed a threat to the regatta founded in 1829But it was the spirit of Henleywith huge crowds enjoying amateur sportpresented with administrative finessewhich Keller took as the yardstick for the international circuitHe loved the place and he returned every year to play an often small part as umpire of races between undistinguished clubs far below the Olympic standard he was obliged to administerHe said this summer that as he gradually wound down his involvement in sportHenley would be the last thing he would give upDuring his term as President of FISA he gradually reduced his role in Eduard Keller Ltd and used the company offices to provide a world headquarters for rowingThe sport is now obliged to find income from the more normal sources of television and sponsorshipto replace his largely unacknowledged private patronageIn spite of his gift to the sportKeller was anxious not to abuse his status as President and never went to a rowing event unless invitedBecause of thishe had never seen the Oxford and Cambridge boat race until this yearHe was enthralled by the entire proceeding and remarked that only the English could make a contest between two crews which would not rank in the World's top 10 into a bigger spectacle than the Olympic finalThe final task he set himself for his Presidencywhich was due to end next yearwas to weed out of the Regatta calendar all the rowing courses which could be made unfair by the windHe had recently travelled from Tasmania to Norway in search of the perfect 2,000 metres of flat waterIt was a blessing thatin response to congratulations on the superb World Championship Regatta at Bled in Yugoslavia three weeks agohe was able to replyYesand best of allthe conditions were fair throughout
