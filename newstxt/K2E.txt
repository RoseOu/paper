volunteers also help people whose pets have been stolenA degree of frustration With the influx of students from the Republic what does the future hold for Ulster's high-flyersTHE 2,000-odd students from the Republic who choose to study in Northern Ireland are a streetwise crowdThey know all about how to exploit the EC rules in order to obtain a free university educationall fees paid by the Department of Education at Rathgaeloutside BangorCo DownThis should not surprise youfor it happens also to be the case that they tend to be an exceptionally well-qualified crowdMy authority for saying that is the Reader in Sociology at Queen's UniversityRobert Cormacksome of whose latest findings have been discussed in this newspaper by Claire McGahan this weekMr Cormack is just back from a conference of academics held at Turkua Finnish port on the Baltic coast east of Helsinkiwhere he and his colleagueRobert Osbornegave a paper on the pattern of higher education hereIt is fascinating stuffboth for what it says and what it leaves unsaidHe makes the point that the arrival of these southerners and westernershas enabled the University of Ulster to push up the minimum entry grades for some coursesHe says this has been a deliberate policy at UU for some timeBut the obvious question arisesif the bright sparks from the Republic are coming inwho here is being crowded outBecause we know thatas Mr Cormack puts itnot all leaverswho go to England and Scotland to take their degrees are willing leaversHe points out that the young fellow or girl with only modest Alevels now has little choicethey have to do without or go across the waterBut if that is sowho are theyHere comes the rubMr Cormack does not sayBut I have digested his paper andwell loaded with statisticshave been making one or two inquiries of my ownHis figures show that very many students from working-class homes tend to do less well in their Alevels than the restSo any shortage of places will be likely to hit them hardestMr Cormackhowevershows that nearly half the Roman Catholic students entering higher education here 43pccome from working class homesbut only a little over a quarter of the Protestants do 27pcThe conclusion is obviousand it is that those local searchers for a place herewho are being crowded out by the southernersare most likely to be northern CatholicsMoreover they will tend to be Catholics from just the sort of background the universities here have for years wished to see represented more adequately among studentsOne effect of this new competition for places locally is that the students who go to England or Scotland no longer automatically represent the elite they tended to in the 1970s and 1980sThey still include many high flyersbut Mr Cormack shows that an appreciable number are now likely to be modest attainers who were crowded out of a place at homeIt is astonishing that more Protestants now study in universities on the mainland more than a quarter than are to be found in the University of Ulsterand if we take the totalonly 55pc of Protestant students now study hereSo much for bridge-building and healing local divisionsand cross-border traffic going south is barely a trickleThe Protestants are scarcely measurable and the Catholics 3pcamount to only a quarter of the proportion who went 20 years agoWith the cost to the student of a higher education tending to rise sharplyfewer in future may be able to afford the luxury of studying across the waterMr Cormack foresees school-leavers having to fight even harder for a place hereIt may well bein any casethat we now have a high enough proportion of school-leavers in cap and gownOnly a generation ago there were barely 2,000This autumn we have 10,000Perhaps we need more technically-orientated vocational

rebuttalNow Daph and I have been married for 30 yearsIt hasn't seemed that long because for ten of them she was on the phone and another ten in shoe shopsBut she was around the house long enough for me to figure out that whatever arguments she has with herselfat the end of the day she will find some really crackerjack reason for doing whatever it is she wanted to do anywayNot only is she advocate for both sidesshe is the jury as wellTalkingHowever when it got to about seven o'clock in the evening and she was still arguing with herselfI made the mistake of getting testy about itFor God's sakeI

dangerously ill motherIt is the first time the Service has explained its stand in the disputewhich led to serious disturbances among loyalist inmates in the MazeLoyalist sources have also claimed that the murder of prison officer Jim Peacockwhose funeral is taking place todaywas linked to the incidentIn a statement the Prison Service said it wanted to clarify the situation in view of misleading accounts of the operation of the Compassionate Home Leave SchemeInformedA prisonerwho it was alleged had recently been refused Compassionate Home Leave to visit a dangerously ill relativehad already been allowed three visits over a period of three weeksOn the occasion in question when he was due to go on a fourth visitthe prison was informed that unfortunately the relative had diedIn view of this

good Samaritan has unwittingly helped ease the pain of Joan McDermottJoan travelled from Scotland with a bag full of gardening tools to tend to her son's graveBut instead of finding it overgrown with weedsa pretty posy of artificial flowers stood on the well-groomed plotThe kindness of this unknown person was too much for Joan who broke down and weptLeavingIt is five years since Joan left Northern Ireland to join her husband Ted in ScotlandBefore that she could not bear to leave because it meant leaving Brian behindSuch was the sense of outrage and feeling for the family after the murder that collections were made in towns across the provinceThe money paid for the headstone and Mr and Mrs McDermott's appreciation is obvious in the inscription at the bottom which readsDonated by the people of Northern IrelandOf the thousands of headstones in Roselawn cemetery Brian's remains the only one which does not carry the date of his death it is not knownLeaving the grave was agony for Joanwho felt she was leaving her youngest child behindHardI don't want to leave himshe sobbedI used to visit it everyday and it's just so hard to know I won't see it again for a whileIt helps to know that someone is looking after itthat someone caresI don't know who this person is as we have no family here nowBut I would like to thank them and let them know how very grateful I am and how much it helps to know his grave is being cared forON THURSDAY exactly 20 years to the day since their son went missing Joan and Ted McDermott made the emotional journey back to BelfastIn a scene which would have broken the heart of every parentthe elderly couple cried uncontrollably at the sight of their son's graveThey laid flowers from Brian's two brothers and sistersand there was a special posy from mum

gravePicture By FRED HOAREI would give anything to know how he died and whenA mother's agony goes on 20 years after her son's deathBy STEPHANIE BELLTHE AGONY of what happened to her son is as acute for Joan McDermott today as it was 20 years agoNot knowing exactly WHEN Brian diedHOW much he suffered and WHO killed him is torture for herThere is not a day goes by that Joan does not think of her youngest childHe would have been 30 nowshe saysHe always wanted to be a detective when he grew upI often wonder if he would have fulfilled his dreamIf he would be married now and have childrenShoutingBut I can't picture him any other way than the little boy he was on that last day I saw himJoan remembers that last morning at home with Brian as if it were yesterdayI was starting to make the Sunday dinner and Brian said he was going out to play in the parkI gave off to him about not brushing his hairI can still remember standing brushing his hair and then shouting after him not to be long because his dinner would soon be readySearchesWhat happened to Brian when he left home that day remains a mysteryHis father and brothers joined police and Army in exhaustive searches of the nearby Ormeau park and riverIn the week that followed before the mutilated remains of his body were found Joan lost two stone in weightShe saidI couldn't eat or sleep that weekI just kept thinking who had my sonWhere was heIt was on September 9 that a soldier on foot patrol along the Annadale Embankment pulled a sack from the River LaganJoan recalled what happenedApparently the soldier opened the bag and something fell out and he thought it was a paw and that somebody had thrown a dog into the riverHe said he did not think it was humanWhen he opened the bag completely he realised it was a human beingForensicI heard rumours in the street that a child's body had been found in the river and I asked the policeThey said they didn't think it was Brian but asked if forensic could come to take some prints from his toys and school booksWhen they told me the body had been mutilated and burnt I didn't think it was BrianI thought no one could do that to my youngsterand I put it out of my mindThe arrival of the police to her Well Street home a short time later started the nightmare which continues for Joan even todayThe police didn't have to tell meI knew immediatelyI was hystericalI just couldn't understand how or why anyone would do that to my BrianHe was a lovely childa typical boy although he was fairly shy and quietApparently he was unrecognisableThe hand of the arm that was not hacked off was clenched and his thumb tucked insideshe saidThat's why the skin on his thumb did not burn and they were able to get the printWhen Brian used to watch horror movies with us and he was scared that's how he clenched his handsHe must have been really frightened when he diedBrian's body was so badly mutilated and charred that the pathologists could not determine the exact cause or time of deathThis has added to Joan's torment over the yearsalong with the fact that his vicious killer or killers have not been foundI don't know if he was strangledshot or stabbedI don't know if he was sexually assaulted and maybe died of shockIt kills me to think of what he might have sufferedI would give anything to know how he died and whenI don't even know if he was killed that Sunday or if he was tortured before he was murderedHe could have been crying for his mummyConscienceI pray that before I die I will knowThere had to be more than one person involvedMaybe one of them did not want to be involved but kept quiet because of fearMaybe now after 20 years that person may want to relieve his or her conscience and help put me and my husband out of our misery by coming forwardIf anyone knows anything that could help and has kept quiet for any reasonI would beg them to please come forward now20.0 LEFTThe last picture ever taken of Brianin his scout's uniformRIGHTFlashback to the

the Brook Advisory CentreThe Brook Centre was established in Belfast last year to provide young people with professional advice on all sexual mattersThe Eastern Health & Social Services Board invited Brook here in view of the high incidence of teenage pregnancy in recent yearsBrook's confidential and non-judgmental approach encourages young people to seek the advice of its highly qualified staffmany of whom are parents themselves and are well acquainted with the problems of adolescenceFurthermoreBrook has also developed a good working relationship with other voluntary groups and welfare organisationsIts work has been commended by the Church of Ireland's Board on Social ResponsibilityBrook does not actively encourage premature sexual activity amongst young peoplecontrary to what your correspondent suggestsBrook staff treat each client as an individual and try to help the person to make her or his own decisions and find solutions to particular problemsIf adult members of society fail to encourage sexual responsibility amongst young peoplethe inevitable outcome will be more unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseasesIs this what M.R.and Family and Youth Concernreally wantPerhaps your correspondent could enlighten us as to the best method of preventing unwanted teenage pregnancybearing in mind that young people will always form sexual

lick the vaseline mixture that was smeared over our bodies to stop the skin chappingAt the tender age of ninejust after the warhe was part of the second group of children from England to be shipped to AustraliaI never really thought I would go therehe saidA man came and showed us slides of both Australia and CanadaOf courseit all seemed very excitingIt was so easy to say I wanted to go to

sexual health thereBrook dispenses contraceptives to allregardless of age or statusand including under-age girlsBrook will also make all the necessary arrangements for its young clients to obtain abortionsBrook operates without parental knowledge or consentdetermined that parents should never know that their under-age children are sexually active and receiving contraceptionif the child requests confidentiallyBrook is equally determined that parents should have no say over their children's exposure to permissive sex-education materialThose areas where Brook's influence is strongest have particularly high abortion ratesHoweverreaders may be glad to know that Family and Youth Concern are hosting a one-day conference at the Wellington Park Hotel on 11th Septemberwhen Mrs Victoria

in British schoolswhich in practice offer only a moral sexual instructionand subject the young to ideas which would not normally occur to themThe conference is open to all those people of good-willwho
