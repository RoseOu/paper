been vacant ground for a long number of yearsand the planning people insisted that there never had been houses fronting on to the Donegall RoadMr Smyth explainedBut the fact is that my own mother and father lived in Innes Place in their first house after they were marriedSo we got ourselves an Ordnance Survey map for the year of my birth and were able to prove that houses had indeed existed

on Dublin in 1974 has angered the Dublin City CouncilThe council asked the Government to erect a memorial next year to mark the 20th anniversary of the atrocityHowevera letter from the Department of the TaoiseachAlbert Reynoldsstated that it would be invidious to single out the victims of this particular atrocity for special official commemorationagainst the background of approximately 3,000 deaths resulting either directly or indirectly from violence in Northern IrelandThe letter added that while it was a matter for the City Council to determine whether to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the eventthere are no funds at the disposal of this Department to meet the costs involvedThe Lord MayorTomas Mac Giollasaid he found the reply from the Taoiseach's Department quite horrifyingThe council passed a motion backing calls by relatives of those killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings for an official inquiryBy Michael DevineEthnic warfareSECTARIANISM has always been one of the prime causes of conflict in Northern Irelandbecause religion has been so closely identified with politicsIt turns neighbour against neighbourbreaking down trust in a way that the paramilitary organisations are finding easy to exploitOn the one sidethe IRA would argue that its hands are clean and that its attacks are solely aimed at weakening the British linkIts targetshoweverare as calculated to arouse sectarian feelings as the UDA's or the UVF'sIts bombs almost invariably devastate towns and property where Protestants are in the majority and its shootings are directed at members of the security forceswho are mainly ProtestantIn returnthere has been a growing incidence of sectarian attacks from the loyalist paramilitariesTheir first reaction to the bomb in Armagh was to toss petrol bombs into houses in a predominantly Catholic estateendangering the lives of four familiesThree of last week's four murderscarried out with unbelievable brutalitywere clearly intended to spread sectarian terrorThere is no point in arguing who cast the first stone or threw the first bombdestroying a church hall or a GAA clubBut both communities must recognise the cancerous effect of sectarianismtaken to these extremesIt conjures up the same emotions that have led to the horrors of ethnic cleansingin Bosniawith rival religious and political groups staking out new dividing linesReligious leaders spell out their warningsin countless funeral servicesbut their words will be wasted without a response from the politiciansTheir fundamental disagreements on how Northern Ireland should be governedwith its two identitieshelp perpetuate the conditions for sectarian violenceThey must try again and again for a compromise that is fair and honourableIt is depressing to hear from a leading UnionistKen Maginnishow little faith there is in the talks processwithout a fundamental change of attitudesPlans for devolution have been exchangedbut have hardly been considered by the other sideThe SDLP seems to be leading the Irish Government and the Ulster Unionists and the DUP are splitMeanwhile the British Government acts as a neutral observerIn view of the critical need to provide political alternatives to violencethe talks must be reconvened as soon as possibleThis timehoweverthere must be a new sense of realismon all sidesThe sovereign government

voteJOHN MAJOR heads a deeply unpopular governmentHis personal standing is the lowest recorded for a Prime Minister and even the flow of funds from the party faithful is drying up under his faltering leadershipAgainst such a background it would appear that Labouras the alternative party of powershould prosperYet when Labour's prospects are rosiestit always seems to shoot itself in the footThe rumbling row with the unions over ending the block vote is a classic example of its suicidal tendenciesParty leader John Smith is right to press ahead with his plans to end the official role of the unions in selecting parliamentary candidatesbut by allowing open confrontation with the unions to continue simmering he is undermining his good intentUnion power is a spectre constantly raised by the Tory Party to scare the electorateMr Smith needs to end the public bickering over one-man-one-vote to persuade voters that Labour is in control of its own destiny and not the puppet of the trade unionsLabour's traditional bedrock of support is among the working classes as exemplified by the trade unionsIt cannot sever such connectionsbut should end the practice of the block vote by which unions wield enormous power in party affairsThis is a matter which should be finalised swiftly so that the party can move on to formulate appealing economic and social policiesThe Government is in disarray at present but various indicators suggest that the economy may be coming out of recessionIf Labour cannot stake its claim to be the future governmentit may be by-passed by events and find

after Aisling Rodgers was born a woman approached her parents and accused them of pouring scalding water over the babyShe didn't know that Aisling had been born with a severe port wine stainThat groundless remark still rankles with Aisling's father Martin eight years laterThat woman did not know about such birthmarksOthers still display similar ignoranceThey stare at Aisling or say don't touch that mark or you will catch itInitially doctors were unable to offer any treatmentbut Martin and his wife Teresafrom Londonderrydid their own research and found a support group in EnglandTripsThrough them contact was made with a Swiss doctorHe told us that a new lasera pulsed dye device similar to the one now installed at the Ulster Hospitalcould reduce the birthmarks by up to 90pc in some casesWe signed up for treatment with him when Aisling was about three and made ten trips to GenevaShe was given concentrated treatment over each weekendMoney for the trips came partly from ourselves and our familiesbut also from fund raising by Aisling's school and the general publicAir miles donated covered four return flightsIt was very expensivewith each session costing £150but the benefits were enormousAisling's condition is quite severe but the doctor was able to give her a discernible lip-line and reduce the depth of staining on her face by up to 20pcTreatmentWe decided to suspend treatment for a while but have been put on the waiting list at the UlsterUnfortunately Aisling has had to have eye operations after developing glaucoma and this has prevented treatment resumingShe has borne the treatment well but some days does feel self-consciousShe will say to us please stop those people staring at meSadly there is not enough public information about this

CourtBy David WatsonDublin's border bill a distortionULSTER Unionist security spokesman Ken Maginnis has accused the Dublin Government of deliberately distortingthe true cost of border securityIn an address to Young Unioniststhe Fermanagh and South Tyrone MP slammed SDLP and Eire politicians who claimed it cost a million pounds each day to secure the borderThe reality is that even if 1,000 soldiers as detailed in the Dail Defence Estimatesare stationed along the borderthey are not extratroops but normally enlisted men and women who wouldirrespective of terrorismstill have to be budgeted forhe maintainedMr Maginnis claimed the only extra costswhich could be directly attributed to the terrorist campaignwere weekly allowances of £44.58 for officers and £39.01 for NCOs and privatesBombsIf one averages this out at around £41 per soldier per week for 1,000 troops the annual cost works out at a mere £2.1m a long way short of the £365m claimed for propaganda purposesHe alleged the deliberate distortionwas employed to deflect attention from the Dublin Government's ambivalent attitude to terrorismIt would give a better idea of the effectiveness of co-operation if the public had a chance to look at the frequency with which bombs are transported into Northern Ireland in vehicles stolen in the RepublicThe one which detonated at Lisnaskea in my constituency just a few days ago was one of many stolen in Dublin a few days previouslysaid Mr MaginnisWomenA new campaign to enlist women in the fight against terrorism along the border has been launched in the RepublicThe

him and bit half his ear offThe lawyer told the court the injured party went to hospital where he was told his ear could have been sewn back on if he had brought it with himbut it was not found until the next dayAssaultsDefence counsel said the assault was a crime of passionwhich had arisen out of McAteer's ongoing marital difficulties and was not assisted in any way by the philandering of the

before the European Court of Human Rightsand the commission will launch its own inquiriesIRA unitDanny McCannMairead Farrell and Sean Savage were shot dead after the SAS was called into Gibraltar in

that an independent international investigation is to take placeAny investigation that will honestly look at the facts must find that Article 2 was violatedWorriedI would think the British Government

today's ruling was achieved against a background of Government immunity certificates being issuedIt will probably open up the whole issue againhe commentedThis is probably the most spectacular of all those cases and should attract international attentionLawfulThe decision means that the 25-member commission will now start its own inquiry into the Gibraltar caseWhen it completes itperhaps within a

hopes to resume on WednesdayWaiting list plan slammedPLANS by a health authority to publish the names of consultants with long waiting lists have come under attackShadow Health Secretary David Blunkett said the move by West Midlands Regional Health Authority is a fruitless exerciseand warned it would confuse patientsThe authority is to highlight the names of surgeons and hospitals and their waiting lists in the Express and StarWolverhamptonon Thursdayas part of an overall strategy to ensure the public gets speedy treatmentInformationAn authority spokesman saidWe are not being judgmental about thisbut we do feel it is important information and people have a right to knowBut Mr Blunkett said patients had no way of knowing why some consultants had longer queues for treatmentIt is the GP who recommends the patient to the consultant and the particular department to attendPatients will have no way of telling whether the waiting list is a reflection of high quality and statusor that the consultant is doing a lot of outside non-NHS workThere are a number of problems with this and it uses NHS money in a quite fruitless wayUnfairThe British Medical Associationrepresenting more than 80,000 doctors and surgeonsalso attacked the moveA spokesman saidIt is a pointless exercise and we think this leaguetableitisis no way health care should be measuredIt is unfair on the public because they cannot know why some waiting lists are longer than othersBELFASTJammed crane blocks trafficA CRANE caused traffic chaos in Belfast yesterday when it got stuck under a bridgeThe crane was too high

police in security rowTHE RUC and West Belfast MP Dr Joe Hendron clashed today over the level of effort by the security forces to combat loyalist terrorismThe SDLP MP questioned the police's commitment to the taskbut the RUC hit back with a staunch defence of their security policyThe row centred on a statement by Dr Hendron in the wake of a meeting yesterday with Security Minister Sir John WheelerThe emergency talks came in response to four loyalist murders in Belfast last weekDr Hendron saidOf course we support police in their work against both sets of paramilitariesHoweverwe told Sir John that at times there does not seem to be the same will on behalf of the RUC to combat loyalist terrorismThere is not the same level of security force presence in loyalist areasThere is not the same number of police checkpoints in loyalist areasThe RUC rejected these claims within hoursA spokesman saidTerrorism is terrorism and the RUC makes no distinction in vigorously pursuing those responsibleDeployedThe record of arrests and seizures clearly demonstrates the impartiality and determination of the policeThe resources of the police are deployed in all areasIn a direct reference to the West Belfast MPthe spokesman addedDr Hendron may well recall that in recent months the RUC presence in loyalist areas has produced complaints of police harassmentThe West Belfast MP is also concerned about alleged links between members of the security forces and loyalist terroristsHe saidIn the past there has been the perception of collusion between the RUC and loyalist paramilitariesThe Brian Nelson affair and the other cases have shown that it is often more than a perceptionIn many ways this has destroyed nationalist confidence in the RUCCheekDr Hendron also hit out at some unionist

trenchant attack on the Government's recordhe dwelt on the vital role of trade unions in the fight to restore workers' rightsMr Smith spoke of their sharedgoal in overturning Tory policiesAlthough it was clear that Mr Smith adopted a much warmer tone towards the unions than his predecessor Neil Kinnockthe speech also marked an attempt to ease tension between him and some union baronsDamageHe told delegates he believed the case for strong trade unions was as compelling now as it was when the TUC first met 125 years agoor ever has been in the history of our countryIndeedafter the damage that successive Tory governments have inflicted on our social and economic fabricwe need as never before strong trade unions to fight for jobs and social justiceHe went onThey are needed because so many people at work simply do not have the power or the resources to achieve these things for themselvesThe trade unions were insisting that Britain abided by the same social protection rules as other EC

community which feels that no-one cares naturally turns into itself for reassuranceThat is what is happening in Catholic and Protestant areas of Northern IrelandOrdinary people have lost a considerable amount of confidence in the authoritiesThe end result is that some believe that retaliation against the other sideis the only protection they haveLook at the emergence of vigilantes in BritainMisguidedly they are taking the law into their own hands because they believe the police are not doing their job properly for whatever reasonThe Government and the forces of law and order have to be seen to be concerned and to be effectiveIn our case concern would be a starting pointIN OUR household as in many others recently there were a few worrying days before the GCSE examination results were publishedIt was only then that I properly realised how much pressure there is on children today to succeed academicallyIs it justifiedA 16-year-old English girl committed suicide after failing to get the required grade to guarantee her a place at art collegeThe coronerquite rightlypointed out that schools do not teach children that in a competitive world some are bound to failThe pressure to succeed will increase as schools compete on the exam league tablesChildren will be cannon fodder to boost a school's imageSurely that is not why we send children to be educatedInstant recoveryI HAD to report a theft the other dayAnd a recovery at the same timeIt was strange to be filling in the two forms at the same timeBut that is what the nice policeman wantedWhat had happened was thisHam-fisted thieves had tried to steal a Metro GTi from my drivewayBut in their clumsy efforts to break the steering lock they had broken the steering itselfThe result was the car was found parked half on the footpath just a few yards awayAnd I am told that another Metro got similar treatment in Newtownards on that Friday eveningIt was a reminder than none of us is safe from the car thievesIf you have a tastycarlock it away in the garage at nightOr invest in those lockable posts for the end of the driveToo close for comfortDRIVING too close to the vehicle ahead is still a common tendency on Ulster roadsI suppose that many of the culprits work on a perverted logic of if it stopsthen so will IBut even the best brakes in the world will not stop you as quickly as hitting somethingFor those who care about such things a little bleeper has just come onto the market to enable you to check that you are following the two-second rule that the police recommendFor exampleif the car in front goes under a bridge it should take you two seconds to reach that pointThat isif you want to stand a chance of stopping before hitting itThe Ring safestop costs just £3 and can be stuck onto the dashIt sounds for the requisite two seconds for those of you who don't know the rhyme I reckon that's oneA more sophisticated approach is being researched by Toyota in JapanThey are testing sensors which monitor speed and the distance from the car in frontIf you get too close a warning is soundedif you ignore thisthe brakes are appliedTravellers seek Down siteA GROUP of

Down District Council to provide a permanent site which could be used by travellers visiting the areaWe would not mind paying for proper wash and water facilitiesA site would be a great help and is badly neededhe saidHoweverthe leader of the DUP group on the councilWilliam Dicksaid his party would oppose any attempt to provide a permanent site for travellersHe claimed this would be a drain on the ratepayerThere is no reason why these people cannot be integrated within the community and pay their share of rates the same as anyone elseThey cannot become a liability and in my view that is what they would becomeMr Dick saidIrish signs help cross cultural barrierOVER the summer months I have been attending a class to learn Irish sign language and it has given me a new understanding of what hearing people must feel when learning to talk to deaf peopleThe British sign language we use here has many similarities to the sign language used in Scotland and England and I have little difficulty in talking to deaf people on the mainlandBut Irish sign language is a different kettle of fishIt differs from BSL in the same way as Gaelic differs from EnglishIt is very complexvery grammaticaland the finger spelling is done on one handMany hearing people assume that sign language is the same the world overThat is not the caseand while it is true that deaf people from different countries can converse with each other better than hearing folkthey all have their own signs and structureDifficultThe class I attend is run by James McKernanwho was educated in Dublin and is equally fluent in both BSL and ISLJames is a good teacher and we have great fun laughing at each other 's mistakesBut the language is so difficult to learn that there are times when I feel completely stupid and understand hearing people's difficulty in learning sign languageThe reason I want to learn ISL is that I often go to Dublin and feel ashamed of my inability to communicateMany of the Dublin deaf have a smattering of BSL and can talk to me better than I can talk to themBut I am completely lost at meetings and need an interpreterLast week a party of Dublin deaf were in Belfast and I had the opportunity to put my new skills into useMy spelling is still very slowbut I was pleased to see how much I was able to follow conversationsA lot of their signs are based on an initial key letterOnce you catch that the rest becomes easierWE ARE considering starting a home in Belfast for older deaf people and the Dublin deaf were here to advise us and tell us their experiences in the SouthThis preliminary meeting will be followed by a weekend seminar at Dublin in October when we will discuss the whole picture of older deaf people in this the EC year of the elderlyAfter lunch two mini-buses took us to the Ulster Folk Museum at Cultra and the Dublin deaf were overcome by the beauty of our countrysideRapportOne of them is a teacher of deaf children at St Mary's and she loved the old schoolroom at the museum and told me that her class were doing a project on Northern Ireland and she must bring them here to see it allThere is a wonderful rapport between the deaf people from both North and South which the troubles or the language barrier have never spoiledI WAS once interviewed for a radio programme on BBC and was asked how deaf people had fared during the past 20 yearsI told the interviewer that deaf people were a wonderful example of how people of different cultures and a different language could live together in perfect harmonyIf only the hearing world would follow our exampleMAUD Smyth has asked me to thank the Rev Grindle and all who helped to make the memorial service for her brother Thomaswho had died in Canadaso beautiful and movingTom's widow and son flew over
