M. Barrie's Peter Pan storyconcentrated on the ageing directorial wunderkind's affinity for the subject of a boy who never grows upLittle fuss has been made of the director's original notion of casting Michael Jackson as Peterbut Spielberg has clearly missed the boat in refusing to commission Robert Smithfront man and only constant factor of The Cureto compose the scoreThe Cure are pop's truest Lost Boysstill 14 years after their first professional recording bravely confronting the desires and dilemmas of sensitive adolescenceTheir latest albumWish Fiction/Polydornot only includes a song called Wendy Timebut it also celebrates the durability of Smith's most precious assetmiraculously unimpaired by the passage of the yearshis ability to retain a sense of wonder at each manifestation of the most basic of human emotionsThe joy and pain of love and separation not to mention a certain degree of despair at the intractability of the world's ills and follies are a constant backdrop to any adult view of human existenceto teenagers and Robert Smith both exhilaration and horror are perpetually freshThus Wish veers dizzily from gleeful whimsy to cosmic angstfrom unconfident extroversion to manic introspectionSmith marries these preoccupations to highly effective pop psychedelia like Syd Barrett-vintage Pink Floyd under contemporary radio discipline to produce spectacular ear candy like the exultant Friday I'm In Love as well as woe-is-me epics like the appropriately titled Open and EndSmith once declared that The Cure would never court pop's mainstreamand that the mainstream would have to expand in order to embrace The CureThis has undoubtedly come to passSmith's shock-hairedlipsticked moonface is internationally recognisable and The Cure sell massive quantities of records in every market where brightsensitive adolescents spend moneyPlease stop loving medemands Smith at the album's climaxFat chanceThey'll love him all the moreThe ArtsLooking after the dollars and centsBy TONY PARSONSMADONNA's new contract with Warner Brothers is said to be worth a cool $60 millionThe woman who started the craze for wearing underwear on top of your clothes don't knock it if you haven't tried it will receive a $3 million advance on her publishing contracta $5 million advance for each new album and $2 million upon delivery of each finished recordThe Warners deal reportedly also includes a royalty rate of nearly 20 per cent and generous funding for developing Madonna projects on the big and small screenBut this pop business is not all eight-figure deals and unimaginable

studio and discussing a new recording contract with IslandAnd then there are some musicians who merely make a livingMusic Week reports that session men are receiving a miserly £30 or £40 for

helped Pink Floyd to fame but has never scaled music's financial heightsBy ROBERT CHALMERSAFTER a few minutes in the company of Joe BoydI was wondering whether there was anybody in world music he had not heard ofIn a misguided attempt to impress the veteran American producerI brought up the name of Jaume Sisaa songwriter I once met by chance in a bar in Barcelonaand a man whose work is considered obscure even in CataloniaBoyd has all his albumsWild eclecticism has been the hallmark of Boyd's 30-year career as record producerfailed film mogul and quixotic entrepreneurAs stage manager at the 1965 Newport Folk Festivalhe was at Bob Dylan's elbow after the singer was first barracked for using electric instrumentsThe discoverer and producer of the English folk-rock group Fairport ConventionBoyd also collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the soundtrack for A Clockwork OrangeSince 1980when he founded his own labelHannibal Recordshe has been an enthusiastic supporter of music from Africa and Eastern Europebut has still found time to produce albums by mainstream American groups such as REM and 10,000 ManiacsThe great thing about Joe Boydsays Andy Kershawwhose Radio 1 show provides one of the rare outlets for the African percussionists and Bulgarian tractor mechanics' choral ensembles currently recording for Hannibalis that he has consistently put his artistic principles before his commercial instinctsHe isin the nicest senseone of life's brilliant failuresBoydwho will be 50 next yearhas changed little in appearance since he graduated from Harvard in the early SixtiesHis manner is the epitome of Ivy League rectitudeone of Boyd's friends told me that the producer once ticked him off for breaching etiquette on opening a car door for a ladyYet this is the same man whoin the mid-Sixtiesran the UFO club in Tottenham Court RoadHere Boyd promoted free-form art groupswith names like David Medella and the Exploding GalaxyIt was indicative of the UFO's distinctive ambiance that the lighting was provided by a 50-year-old naturistHe was from WatfordBoyd explainsHe was very interested in lightingbut basically he was a nudistThere were a lot of people like thatJoe Boyd's career began in PrincetonNew Jerseywhenas an 18-year-oldhe discovered that Lonnie Johnsonthe legendary blues guitaristhad been reduced to washing dishes in a Philadelphia hotel kitchenBoyd borrowed his parents' carbrought Johnson up to the family home in New Jerseyand charged his friends a dollar each to attend the impromptu concertThe journey from Philadelphia was a fraught oneBoyd saysprincipally because Johnson an uncompromisingly direct ladies' man whose prolonged career as a plongeur had left him unused to the excitements of the open road offered robust salutations to every woman pedestrian they passed en routeBoyd first came to Britain in the early Sixties as the organiser of one of the first package tours of blues and gospel musiciansfeaturing artists such as Muddy Waters and the Reverend Gary DavisIn the mid-Sixtiesas a prominent if unlikely member of London's undergroundhe produced the first single by the Pink FloydBoyd's other proteges from this time included Fairport Conventionwhose singerSandy Dennydied tragically at the end of the Seventiesand a gifted young songwriter called Nick DrakeDrakewho served an unusual rock nroll apprenticeship at Marlborough and Cambridge Universityreleased three LPs of inspiredif doom-ladensongs before taking his own life in 1974You cannot help noticing that the incidence of fatalities among Boyd's artistes seems remarkably higheven by the alarming standards of the pop businessOf Denny and DrakeBoyd says thatwhile he feels their deaths keenlyhe does not hold himself personally culpableI think there is a major difference between Nick Drake and Sandy Denny and a rock casualtylike Sid ViciousBoyd saysin that there was a direct correlation between their level of fame and their musical talentI was not manipulating them or elevating them artificiallyso much as attempting to support talent to reach its natural levelBoyd's activities in the late Sixties set the pattern for his subsequent enterprisesTypicallyhis discoveries receive substantialsometimes posthumouscritical acclaimbut fail to make himor themselvesany moneyHe had no better luck when he went to Hollywood in the Seventies and attempted unsuccessfullyto produce a number of intriguing projectsincluding a cinema version of Ian Gibson's book on the death of Garca Lorcato have been directed by Francesco Rosidirector of

the verge of bankruptcy a couple of years agoHannibal was rescued by an American company in a deal which left Boyd in charge as manager of the labelThese dayshe is attempting to persuade record-buyers to share his enthusiasm for music from Eastern Europethe Trio Bulgarkafrom Sofiaand the hauntingly beautiful songs of the Hungarian Marta SebestyenIf these projects seem likely to enhance Boyd's musical reputationthey are showing no immediate signs of improving his bank balanceThe trouble with Joeone of his more affluent colleagues in the pop business told meis that he suffers from the fatal

pointed shoesBy NADINE MEISNERTWENTY more or less innocent little faces looked at the pianist and the two teachers and chantedThank you Marythank you Brendathank you MichaelWonderfully neat in their red and black practice clothesthey had gone through the rigours of a simplified ballet barre with varying degrees of stoicisma mime sequence much enthusiasmand foot-stretching exercises giggles and pretend moansNow they were in the end-of-class ritual of thankspart of ballet's insistence on grace not only of body but also of spiritHundreds of ballet classes exist up and down the countrybut this onein Shepherd's Bushwest Londonis specialmany of the children are blackIt is part of a Royal Ballet project called A Chance to Dancedesigned to stimulate an interest in balletprincipally but not exclusively among black childrenin deprived areasOver two years the children get free weekly training and dancewearThe scheme was launched last autumn by the company's education officerDarryl Jaffrayfor absolute beginners aged between seven and nineWith the help of two London boroughsHammersmith and Fulham and Lambeth2,000 children from 16 schools auditioned for approximately 25 places in each boroughBut why the schemeI had been awareJaffray saysthat there were more people with potential for ballet than ever considered entering a ballet classBallet is essentially a middle-class interestthe domain of white little girls whose parents can afford the feesA Chance to Dance aims to encourage children of all ethnic groups and social backgroundsJaffray started by targeting boroughs with a high black population although the children were subsequently selected purely on meritThe classes certainly do not mirror what you see on the British ballet stageespecially at the Royal BalletIn the total absence of black dancersCovent Garden lags behind other ballet companies in the WestIt admits that remarkably few black students have passed through its schoolYet the modern-dance stage presents a different pictureLook at a troupe like London Contemporary Dance Theatreits numbers are tiny by ballet standardsbut they have always included black dancersNone too soonthe Royal Ballet has decided to take noticeA Chance to Dance is a step towards producing students trained to the company's standards and styleChildren usually have a strong ballet grounding long before they apply to enter the Royal Ballet School from the age of 11So the group at Shepherd's Bush has a way to go before some of them might be deemed fit to audition there or at other vocational schoolsBut they have made startling progress since they started last NovemberTummies have flattenedshoulders have straightenedTo point your right foot to the sidetransfer your weight to the lefttheir teacher Brenda Garratt-Glassman tells themAnd don't look at your feetit distorts your postureTheir other teacherMichael Moorewalks round adjusting bodieswhispering remindersBoth teachers are blackformer members of Dance Theatre of Harlemthe American black ballet companyThey are also EnglishThey are living evidence of the past lack of opportunity for black classical dancers in this countryThe barrier has held back both sidesNot only have ballet companies tended to overlook black dancersbut black dancersobserving the prevailing whitenesshave discarded ballet ambitionsThe Royal Opera House elicits the greatest suspicionIt does scare people offadmits the Royal Ballet's directorAnthony DowellEven a lot of white people sometimes feel it is a no-go areaBut I hope that we will widen the net with this project so that people won't be scared to come forwardBut there has been a gradual shift in attitudes within this bastion of British balletThe dancer Evan Williams joined the Royal Ballet's sister companythe Birmingham Royal Ballettwo years agothe third in a succession of black recruits to that troupeHaving started dancing on the advice of a PE teacherhe was accepted at 16 into the Royal Ballet Upper Schoolthe only black student thereHe had auditioned on his own stubborn initiativealthough people had warned him that because of his colour he was wasting his timeSo why did he succeedI think the timing has a lot to do with itProbably doors were closed in the pastPeople said black dancers don't have the right bodythe right feetAnd black dancers had gone in for contemporary or modern dance because they had felt ballet to be a white art form to be watched by white peopleIt goes even deeper than thatBallet simply does not figure in black or working-class livessuch children tend to go into dance through rock musicreggaediscos and that means modern danceFor that reason Jaffray considered it important to provide concrete images of ballet performancesIt struck us that these children hadn't really had a chance to see what ballet wasParents have been invited to an open day at the Royal Opera House which includes a back-stage touras well as dance and make-up sessionsIn Julythe children will be taken to watch a performance of La Fille mal gardeejudiciously chosen for its humourWe want their first performance to be a real knock-outJaffray saysShe is equally keen that they should have black role-modelsSo it is no accident that the teachers are blackor that she enlisted the active help of Dance Theatre of HarlemTwo of their membersalongside Jaffray and the Covent Garden ballerina Fiona Chadwickpresented lecture-demonstrations to children and families before the auditions last OctoberAnd over recent monthsDance Theatre of Harlem principals have been guesting at Covent Gardenone of theseVirginia Johnsontook part in a Shepherd's Bush classPrejudices take time to crumbleNone is more rock-like than the attitude to men in balletseveral of the boys in the Shepherd's Bush class have left because of teasingBut when Covent Garden does put black dancers on its payrollwhat thenWill they feature as the attendants and train-bearers of the classics or in specialrolessuch as the Moor in PetrushkaOr shall we see black faces among a row of white swansDowell is adamant it will be the second optionAs young dancers they would start and be used in the corps like everybody elseThe old uniformity is no more and we will be all the richer for itThe ArtsIn the name of charityBy LEWIS JONESCHARITY is a divine attributebut we are enjoined to give forgetfully lest we fall into the absurd error of mistaking ourselves for godsThe perils of ignoring this advice were well illustrated by Angel of Bengal C4the True Stories documentary by Anna Raphael which was by turns hilarious and enragingThe angelin question was an American woman who calls herself RytashaApart from a particularly vicious-looking nose-job and alarming turquoise-coloured contact lensesRytasha is rather beautifuland in the 1970swhen she went by the name of Rickishe was a successful model she began life as Maxine ShenkmanAn earlier film by RaphaelThe Persuaders 1986charted the transformation of Ricki into Rytashawhich occurred at the Hare Krishna Temple in Londonand her uneasy relationship with her guru thereIt would have been interesting to have seen the two films togetherSince 1986 Rytasha has broken away from her guru and set up on her own with a charity called Food Relief Internationalwhich raises money from the fiercely competitive matrons of Palm Beach and distributes it to the starving people of BangladeshShe adaws Bangladeshgushed Rytasha's mother the fiercest matron of them allrejoicing in the improbable title of Baroness Thea von Theilheimer ShenkmanShe went on to list her daughter's achievementsShe put in an irritation systemWith no trace of a smile or a blush the baroness quickly corrected herself an irrigation systembut the slip was a telling oneand I'm sure they would have appreciated it in BangladeshThe villagers of Ramsalarecipients of the Palm Beach dollarsexplained to the cameras that they desperately needed a clinicWe told her that a mud hut would dobut she said noshe'd build something pukkaA pukka building was duly erectedbut its medical function has somehow been indefinitely postponedIt is devoted instead to the worship of the charitable Rytashawho is not content simply to hand over the cash but insistsin an unfortunate hangover from her Hare Krishna dayson posturing as a spiritual masterThe villagers seemed unimpressedbut were given no choice in the matterNor could the vaunted irrigation scheme be described as an unqualified successThe money ran out before the scheme's completionand the villagers found themselves obliged to borrow the restThey begged Rytasha for reimbursementbut none was forthcomingand for the want of a few hundred pounds the village lost its crop for the yearNow what are we supposed to doasked one of themAre we to sell our cattle or our landThe most irritating thing about Rytasha and there were many was thatthough she does not speak their languageshe presumes to teach them a spurious form of their own religionOne thing we don't need in this subcontinentProfessor Rokeya Kabeer observedis spiritual guidance we have gurus a dime a dozenThey are far too civilised for that sort of thing in Bangladeshbut I kept thinking wistfully of T.

GORE-LANGTONTWO new RSC shows that have just transferred from Stratford to the Barbican could not be more differentIn the main house there is The Alchemist in a fasthilarious productionThe play comes over as both an astute social comedy and a door-slamming farceBen Jonson's plot milks the greedy Jacobean obsession with the transmutation of base metal into goldthe deluded quest for cure-allsand the lure of easy moneyThough set vaguely in period it is surprising just how contemporary it all seemsThe playwright's scornful eyebrow seems equally arched over today's bunch of New AgersTV

the agony as one shire knight is ruined by another and an honoured guest seduces his host's new brideThe evening takes wing in the touching performances of Michael Maloney and Saskia Reeves as her betrayal eventually leads to a fine deathbed reconciliation sceneKatie Mitchell's revival sets this strictly moral tale of wrongdoing in a very Christian context in which everyone behaves with an irritating and folksy religiosityAs an early domestic melodrama it is not without interestbut this sermonising evening isfranklya slog with only fitful rewards along the way
