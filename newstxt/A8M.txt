far back as 700 BC Hesiod was wary of itGossip is mischievouslight and easy to raisebut grievous to bear and hard to get rid ofIn other wordsmud sticksBut gossip hasn't always had such bad pressEven Oscar Wilde called it charming granted he was one of history's great gossipersbut he was an even greater gossipeeIt has often been noted that while barbarians fight with hatchetscivilised men fight with gossipWellfranklyI'd rather have a little mud than a hatchet thrown at my backAnd gossip needn't be malevolentmy Little Oxford Dictionary defines it simply as informal talkesp about personsIn any casewhen someone gossips well they are called a wit or a conversationalistonly those who gossip badly are tarred with the appellation GossipGood gossip must have an esential core of truth to itand a dose of compassionconcern or at least good humour attachedit is bad gossip that has no basis in factthat is driven obviously and primarily by maliciousnessThat sort of gossip certainly should be condemnedthat is the sort Hesiod warned againstBut even he went on to say that gossip has a kind of divinityAnd Seneca seven hundred years later spoke of that most knowing of persons thegossipThe word gossip itself actually means God's kinOriginally it was a term of respect denoting a godparent as Queen Elizabeth I was the gossip at the baptism of her godson James VIor indicating friends with a common spiritual bondFollowing the peasant habit of referring to any elder as Mother/Fatheror Grandmother/Grandfatherthe word was also applied to any gathering of older folkIt was only when it began to be associated exclusively with women that gossip began its slippery slide into the gutterFrom denoting women friends or gossipsthe word came to denote the speech of gossipsAnd so it acquired its contemporarypejorative connotation of idle chatterThere is a theory that gossip is a form of speech particular to women to womenold peopleservants and slavesIn other wordsto the powerlessBut while Daisy and Rose were gossiping in the downstairs pantrydoes anybody really doubt what Lord Bellamy was doing upstairs in the drawing roomDiscussing affairs of state no doubtThe sort of affairs that lose elections and topple governmentsNot philosophynot theologybut you guessed it gossipA psychiatrist friend of mine recently returned from an international conference in AthensWhen I asked him what

emotional wellbeing of societyit is hardly surprising that the shop-talk of women is gossipGossip is Old Wives' TalesWomen's wisdom has long been fearedOld WomenWitchesSibylsSeersThose who scorn or censure women's talk diminish womenOr seek toGossip is StoriesStories provide entertainmentbut also instructionThe bestmost satisfying gossip is like the bestmost satisfying artit is catharticThrough gossip we learn from other people's lives without undergoing the pain or danger of their experiencesIn shortgossip is a chronicle of humanityAs Ogden Nash put itAnother good thing about gossip is that it is within everybody's reach/And it is much more interesting than any other form of speechImagine if Colette or Jane Austen or Dorothy Parker or Chaucer or Shakespeare or Marcel Proust had lived in a world without gossipTheir works would be skeletaltheir insights would be meagre and meanYou can keep your philosophers speculating on language or your theologians speculating on GodI'll speculate on the human heart gossip's good enough for meFigures of fun Open SpaceI WRITE in response to Judith Raymont November 16who wrote of the cartoon Men A User's GuideIt is either insulting to men and should not be endorsed by publicationor it is witty and amusingin which case weas womenhave no right to complain about equivalent portrayals of female stereotypesIt does not matter if the cartoon is insulting to menThe number of such cartoons is so small thatset against the insults to women broadcast by every newsagent and television channelonly a loony masculist would object to themBefore Raymont works towards ways of showing respectunderstanding and affection to members of the opposite sexshe should realise that the opposite sex's obsession with membersis a problem of enormous gravityThere is nothing respectfulunderstanding or affectionate about page threeW J Gaskill maleEast KilbrideIWOULD agree that male and female stereotypes portrayed in cartoons are equally abhorrentwere it not for the fact thatwhilst one pokes fun at a powerful group in society menthe other perpetuates the oppression of a powerless group womenIn an ideal worldthere would be no need for eitherbut for now I would rather see the frustration expressed in these light-hearted terms than in the sort of man-hating bitterness that has given feminism such a bad nameNatalie Ford BrightonMEN A

London NW3 Give and takeI DISAGREE with Denise Scott Fears' contention that door-to-door collections cause guilt and shamein many peopleI have never had any qualms about refusing to fund a cause I do not supportbut am glad to have the chance to give to good causes I might otherwise have missedHaving made a collection myself in a depressed areaI got £2.30 in totalI saw this small sum not as a personal insult but as a gain for the charity I was supportingVirginia Rudd WorkingtonCumbriaWHILE I sympathise with Denise Scott FearsI know the charity's response would beIt's a cut-throat world out there and we've all got to grab our pieceI once complained to Help The Aged about the way they got kids to compete for badgesby encouraging them to collect a target number of sponsors and thus to pester neighboursTheir response was that this method had greatly augmented their incomeIf Denise Scott Fears has problems refusing adultsshe'll feel even more of a heelrefusing that winsome

be dead to be ignoredLesley Nelson London NW3 Liliane Landor reports on an issue that has shaken the foundations of French politics and put the question of immigration firmly back on the agenda A country dividedLEILA and Fatima Achaboun and Samira Saidani are the most talked-about schoolgirls in FranceFor two months they have been relegated to their school's libraryforbidden to attend classes or take part in any school activitySince they turned up on the first day of term wearing headscarvestheir teacherssupported by the headmasterhave refused to teach them unless the girls remove the offending headgearThe Gabriel-Havez school in Creil where they live stands in the heart of the town's industrial estateIt's a sad grey prefabput up some 20 years ago as a temporary measure and still servicing the needs of this economically depressed small town some 62km north of ParisThe 825 youngsters who attend the school are mainly children of immigrants of over 25 different nationalitiesToday the school finds itself in the midst of a public debate which is shaking the foundations of French politics some say ethics has split Mitterand's Socialist Party down the middle and has put the questions of immigration and integration back on the agenda with a vengeanceMr Chenierethe school's headmasteris a practising Catholic of Martinican origina freemason whose authoritarian methods do not endear him to his studentsHe is adamant that any open manifestation of religious or cultural identity at school goes against the principles of secular state educationTo his creditCheniere did attempt a conciliatory gesture when he suggested that the three adolescents could wear their scarves at school outside class hoursThe girls insist that it is their fundamental right to wear their scarves at all timesjust as some of their fellow students wear skullcaps or the crossThey say they do not understand why their headmaster is so intent on persecuting them when 20 Jewish students do not attend school on Saturdaysa normal part of the school week in FranceConfronted with thisCheniere retorts that there are some differences that are more salient than othersLet them wear their scarves at homehe addsthis school is French and secularThe Affair of the Scarfas it has become knownhas taken the French media by stormIn the past monthnot a day has gone by without national newspapers devoting reams of print to the issueasking in big headlinesas Le Point put itShould we let Islam colonise our schoolsThe left-leaning weekly Le Nouvel Observateur has invited anthropologistsphilosophers of many persuasionsfeminists mostly Frenchand Muslim intellectuals mento pronounce their verdictsOpinion polls have been taken by Le Figaro and L'Evenement du Jeudiwith wildly differing resultsreaders have been encouraged to write and religious leaders of all shades have been called upon to give the benefit of their wisdomToday in Francethe Koran is the flavour of the day as specialistsdissect its verses and explain the mysteries of Islam to the lay massesYet it remains thatfor the first time in 15 years and since the controversy over abortionopinions are divided so haphazardly that traditional political alliances have ceased to operateNo sooner had the Minister of EducationLionel Jospinstated that the scarves could not be a motive for excluding the girls from school than the teachers' uniontraditionally close to the Socialist Partycalled him a traitor and 50 of his deputies signed a petition publicly disaffiliating themselves from his line and asking for his resignationThey found themselves rubbing shoulders with right-wing MPsthe same who in 1984 organised a million-strong demonstration in support of private schools and for the right of the parents to chooseand who today declare themselves staunch supporters of the state secular education systemMme Mitterrand's support of the girlsin the name of respect of religious cultures within the bounds of secularitybrought an angry reaction from French feministsAlong with four other intellectualsincluding Regis Debrayfeminist writer Elisabeth Badinter signed an open letter to Mr Jospinsaying that the scarf is a symbol of Muslim women's oppression and warning him not to capitulateA compromise on this issuethey wrotewould damage all that the French Republic has stood for since the RevolutionRemarkablythe voice of those primarily concerned by the issuenamely Arab womenhas been totally missingLes Nanas Beursan organisation of women of North African descentbelieve that the scarf battle has to be foughtAs Arab feminists of Muslim culturewe believe that fundamentalism in all its forms is dangerous and that the scarf is oppressivesaid spokeswoman Souad BenaniBut it should not be used as a pretext to exclude 12- or 13-year-old girls from school when it is precisely these secular schools that should offer them the opportunity to learngrow and make their own choicesFor her organisationas well as for SOS Racismethe mass movement of young French of immigrant descentthis debate hides another agendaWhat is really being debatedaccording to Hayat Boudjemavice-president of SOS Racismeis immigration and the integration of migrants and their children in French societyAlready the opposition has united to set up a working group on immigrationwith a view to formulating a new billBoudjema believes that the opposition parties are settling a score with the Socialist government and using the schoolgirls as a scapegoatThere's more and more talk about the inability or unwillingness of the North Africans to adapt and conformThis controversy has been tainted by racism parading as a concern for the adolescentswelfaresays BoudjemaThe scarves are being used to fan the age-old fear of the Arab which has been dormant simmering since the Algerian warFor her the real issue is the second generation's right to educationbut not any old educationWe are still being taught about our ancestorsthe GaulsThe history of our countries of origin in AfricaAsia or the Arab world has remained totally obliteratedBoudjemawho is of Algerian descentsays she was totally shocked when she first heard of the Affair of the ScarfWhen women in North Africa and the Arab world are struggling so hard for equality and respectit is ironic that here in France a fundamentalist minority is pushing them to conform to traditionBut we can't sacrifice these girls on the altar of a sacrosanct secularity whichin my viewneeds to be urgently redefined and adapted to a multiracial societyAs the debate goes on and the political parties bid for votes and supportLeilaFatima and Samira are still confined to the libraryIn the meantimein the Paris suburb of Montfermeilthe mayor refused to register children of immigrant descent in his town's primary schooldeclaring that he'd filled his quota of foreign childrenSimilarlyin the small town of Beaucaire in the Southa like-minded mayor refused to admit 40 new children of North African originWhen forced by the Inspectorate of Education to retract his decisionthe good mayor refused them access to the school canteencontrolled by the municipal servicesAs far as I'm concernedhe saidthey don't existGuardian Women is edited by Louise Chunn Quentin Falk on how five minutes of TV documentary grew into a feature film Love among the bigotsTHE source material of A Private Lifeone of the first theatrical projects funded by the BBCderives to all intents and purposes from a five-minute segment in an award-winning BBC series from 1978 called The White Tribe Of AfricaThis disturbing profile of Afrikaners in their own backyard was drawn by David Dimbleby and directed by London-born but South Africa-educated Francis Gerard whomore than a decade latermakes his feature debut with A Private LifeDuring his extended research for the TV serieshe met a close coupleRay and Diana de Proftliving in the Cape Town suburb of MaitlandRecalls GerrardRay and Diana weren't married thenalthough they would dearly like to have beenbecause they were citizens of the RepublicThey had been living together across the colour bar for the best part of 30 yearsThey had met when he was a young and not tremendously enthusiastic policeman and she was a waitress in a seafront cafeHe took her outthey fell in love and started to live togetherThen in 1950 the Population Registeration Act became lawAnd something they had never considered suddenly became very importantRay was whiteWhen Diana's classification came throughshe had been designated ColouredAt about the same time came the Immorality Actwhich made sexual relations between different races a crime against the stateSo Ray then found himself in the position of spending a good many of his working hours enforcing a law which he was breaking himself and increasingly afraid of being arrested by one of his matesTheir relationship became more and more coverthe left the police and they moved to a suburb where they passed for whiteand began the long struggle called trying for whiteWhen children arrivedmatters became even more complicated and ultimatley more tragicRay and Diana weren't revolutionariesnor were they political dissidentsAll they had done was to try to live an ordinary private life in South Africa with the dignity that we all take for grantedsays GerrardThis extraordinary story was ruthlessly edited down to its allotted span and eventually tucked away in the last of four hour-long programmesBut its impact far outweighted its tiny rationIt made Gerard determined to try to tackle the material at the length and depth and with the budget it deservedWith the backing of the BBCthe guarded co-operation of the couple and the collaboration of a fine screenwriterAndrew Daviesa full-length film drama was prepared and Gerard even secured permission to film in Cape TownThen a money crisis hit the BBC and A Private Life was one of the casualtiesThe project went into cold storageperiodically resurfacing over the next six years only to sink once moreGerard confined himself to documentaries and it was while making a 90-minute update on South AfricaBack On The Frontierfor ITV in 1986that he became fired up to press ahead again single-mindedly with the featureWith the Government slowly clamping down on all media coverageunless I moved fast any chance of filming within South Africa would be gone and I did want the accuracy and flavour of the country itself to come through in the filmThe BBC stillhappilyseemed keen to see the film produced and so Gerard budgeted it to be made as simply as possible in 16mm for televisionwith the hope that cinema distributors would find it irresistible and give it a release on the big screenOn the eve of shootingthe co-production partner an offshore bank withdrew from the projectThe BBC itselfvia its Enterprises sectionrescued the day by coming up with the other half of a total £450,000 budgetWith the same actors in tow anda thumbs-up from the African National CongressGerard cranked up againThis timeand just four days before shootinghis cameramanErnie Vinczewas refused entry to the republic on the grounds he was an undesirable alienAfter labyrinthine inquiriesit was discovered he once photographed a series of ducumentaries of which the Government disapprovedA replacement was approved and shooting finally went aheadOVERNIGHT FILE
