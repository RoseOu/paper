leadershipThe advisability of starting that particular debatewhen Labour is far ahead of the Conservatives in the pollswas highly questionableMeanwhileat the GMB conference yesterdayMr Edmonds made a rousing speech in favour of unity between his union and the Transport and General Workers'There is every possibility that he has mixed up his candidates for unity and divisionHe sees the union mergercombining massive resourcesas a way of attracting more membersThere is no guarantee of that and every possibility that it will be read by both employers and workers as fresh evidence that trade unionism is on the retreatIndeedsuccessful labour organisation could have been more firmly based on unions which each combined many skills within a single industryrather than of related functions in a wide range of businessesThe single-industry system was devised by the late Lord Feather whenas a young union officialhe was sent to help West Germany reorganisation after World War IIIt became a crucial component of the renowned economic miracleWith the trickling away of trade union support in this countryit might be too late for such a dramatic change of directionBut it is worth at least as much consideration as the merger planThe limit SHOULD political loyalty have any limitationsJohn Major must have pondered that question several times in past months as various Cabinet ministers depended on his support after making curious decisions on public or private issuesNo doubt he will be giving the point more thought after being assailed in the Commons yesterday over the behaviour of

this year will surely be Devrothe Scottish based maker of sausage skinsThe British love affair with bangers means that the sausage market in the UK is worth nearly £600m a year but as much as one-fifth of the cost of a sausage can be in the skinsDevro's success in providing these skins has made the company worth £200mBut the story of how it got started is an odd oneIt began in the early fifties when American health products company Johnson & Johnsonbest known for its baby powderwanted to develop a new type of surgical suture based on collagen the same sort of stuff that ageing film stars injected to prevent wrinklesIdealOne of its scientists working on the suture project discovered a special type of collagen which made an ideal sausage casingJohnson & Johnson chief executive Frank De Angeli did a management buy-out and set up Devro in Scotlandwhere it quickly become a major exporter world wideAnd Devro's collagen-based sausage skins have proved topsparticularly for frozen sausagesand the company produces 150 different types of sausage skinsThe world's biggest consumers of sausages are the Chineseso the mind boggles at the potentialThe full prospectus for the share sale will be out next ThursdayFirst class bargains aroundTHERE was a time when it was easier to get a stockbroker to buy you lunch than to get him to give a sell recommendation for a shareIt was alwaysbuybuybuyBut the best time to sell a share of course is when everyone else says buyLikewise the best time to buy a share is when it is in the doghouse with everyone saying sellsell sellBy then of course it is usually too late to sellA good example of this is glass giants Pilkington BrosDue to the housing and building recession everyone in the stock market knew it would be reporting dreadful figures this weekBut this is a fine companyand with the shares already down by half from their peak last year is this really the time to sellIt amazes me how ready small investors are to buy rubbishy penny shareswhen it is so easy to spot first class quality companies with shares at a bargain basement levelsOne excellent company where the shares are going cheap at 115p to yield 7pc is BETIt provides services to industry from the Mrs Mop level up to hiring out telescopic lifting gear to TV companiesDownBET was hard hit by the recessionwith profits down last year from £217m to only £18mThe stock market is still nervous of them because of fears that the cost of restructuring will slow down recoveryBut BET has the in-depth strength to come out of this recession as a business toughened by adversityThe same applies to construction group Taylor WoodrowIts latest figures show that on £1.2bn of business it only made £18m profitBut it was hit by £33m of provision against three jobs the Channel TunnelEuro-Disney and the Storebaelt Bridge in DenmarkThese were all superb feats of engineeringBut the bottom line is all that the stock market cares aboutand the dividend is only a token penny a shareYet longer term the shares at 110p are surely worth backingNone of these three shares is a rubbishy penny share stockwhere the price is buoyed up by investors who dream of making a fortuneThese are all fine companies with solid businesses battling through hard times but with real prospects of recovery unlike most of the penny stocksHurry and register for BT3DO hurry up and register for the BT3 share saleRing  if for some reason you do not wish to register with the 150 different organisations banksbuilding societiesstockbrokers and others acting as share shopsI expect next week to be your last chance to register before the shut-off dateAfter that you will still be able to apply for the shares likely final date for sending in your cheques July 12But by failing to register in time you will have lost the chance of being given preference in allocationAm I going to recommend that you buy the BT sharesToo early to say until the incentives are knownBut I was impressed by BT's decision to put £2.8bn into taking a 20 per cent stake in MTIthe second largest long-distance telephone group on the USAThis shows BT is determined to be a world class company not a Little England businessWhat I can say at this stage is that the Government is very keen to use BT3 as a chance to extend wider share ownershipSo the incentives will be goodBut they will be designed to encourage you to be a long-term holder rather than to enable you to take a quick profitRUTHIN Farmers Auction report entries of 1,899 lambshoggets and ewes with a steady trade in all sectionsLight

commentators to compare the fuss recently made about the losses suffered by MPsjudges and others rich enough to have become Namesat Lloyd's of Londonwith the problems suffered by those who are unemployedHow did they get the £250,000 spare wealth needed to qualify in the first placeis one theme I hear from these envy-driven commentatorsWith somelike Tony Jacklin or Susan Hampshireit is perfectly obvious they got it through hard work in their particular callingAnd as a result they have the self-confidence which comes from knowing that if you have made it onceyou can make it againIn that respect they are better off than those who simply inherited the wealthand now have no real idea how to set about replacing what they have lostBut the connection between Lloyd's and the unemployed is much closer than most realiseAll business activities are inherently riskyInsurance helps to reduce the riskSo facilitating an increased volume of business insurance coversuch as that provided by Lloyd's to industryalso increases employment in some cases dramaticallySo the losses suffered by Lloyd's members indirectly affect us allThe losses suffered by the Namesat Lloyd's of London made headline news because some of them are MPs or judges and others are celebritiesBut their losses are in total less than those suffered by the major insurance companies in recent yearsOf course the insurance companies are a good deal less photogenicand much less of a source of scandal for the gossip columnistsAnother difference is that the companies tend to be faster on their feetOnce they realised how risk had suddenly escalated they took steps to cut down their bookBut the individual members of Lloyd'smostly people who were dabbling way over their head in a subject about which they knew littlewere often persuaded to hang on for things to improveThat is nearly always a mistakeAs the old Stock Exchange saying goesYour first loss is your best lossMeaning if you hang on hoping for something to turn upyou invariably lose much moreUsually the wisest thing to do is to cut your losses early onThe moral to be drawn from this sad episode isDon't put your money into any business you cannot understandand where you are at the mercy of the advice given by othershowever trustworthyNow that the worst seems to be overthe insurance companies have been recapitalising themselvesRoyal Insurance has put out a hefty cash callasking shareholders to stump up £404m by subscribing for one new share for every three held at 255pThis has brought the share price back to 290p and they are good value at that levelalthough it will be a couple of years yet before the pre-loss level of dividend can be resumedTony JacklinSusan HampshireAMONG companies reporting today areFinalsCapeAirsprung
