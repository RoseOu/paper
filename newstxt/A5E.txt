MUSIC Beware the pitfalls of sincerityComposer Robin Holloway considers the difficulties of assessing a new piece of musicBy ROBIN HOLLOWAYHow to ensure a sympathetic reception for a new piece of musicIdeally the subject should combine Ecology with special reference to tropical rain-forestswith Protest preferably shrill and futileIt should climax with an ecumenical prayer in every known language simultaneouslyfor intergalactic peaceThe musical material should include at least three of the followingJewish cantillationCatholic plainsongTibetan chantingAboriginal drummingwhalesongThe idiom should be middle-of-the-roadartfully diguised with mod cons clustersglissandielectronicsthere should be a strong pop-music elementplenty of repetition a la Philip GlassWhen inspiration failsfill the gaps with ritual gong-strokesprolonged and amplified to the threshold of painBut such cynicism will not dothis is a serious matterA recent first visit to the USSR brought into focus for me the large question of evaluating music whose basis of appeal is grounded in extra-musical circumstancesThe first problem is the dispassionate judgement of compositions that emerge fromand in some cases directly expresspolitical oppressionThe wide current appeal of such music seems to touch a nerve of communal masochismAudiences yearn to groan under the yoke of suffering they may never have experiencedThere is even a kind of envy for the depth of vision which this fate is thought to produceThe conspicuous case is Shostakovicha composer of enormous gifts and awesome copiousnessthe only one to satisfyif intermittentlyboth his masters and the WestEver since the just criticismmeted out to his early excessesthen the gigantic success of the Leningrad Symphony in the 1940she has symbolized the artist caught in the net of public eventsAs we now know something of the appalling story of his hounding by cultural officialdomthe raucous irony of the middle works and the bitter blackness of the last become entirely comprehensibleHis is the only post-war body of symphonic and chamber music to achieve genuine popularityYet it is drastically imperfectImpressive inspirations mix with the coarsest tritenessthere is an inordinate amount of padding and bombastthe reliance on formulae is the most shameless since TelemannNor did things improve as he grew beyond subjection to state reproofSome late worksnotably the Fourteenth Symphony and the songs on Michaelangelo texts are among his greatestBut in the succession of late string quartetspoverty of substance and spiritual exhaustion are exemplified rather than expressedShostakovichobviously pre-eminent among Soviet composershad to bear the cruellest treatmentBold spirits in the satellite countries were able to take liberties at home LutoslawskiPendereckiKurtagwhen they didn't get away in person PanufnikLigetiThe recent change of policy has unfrozen a flood of music by younger figures who have not undergone similar cultural repressionthough the conditions of their work remain poignant and precariousRecently it has been well-aired in this country through broadcasts and festivalsenough to form an initial overall viewI believe that music-lovers are deluded when they claim to find artistic pleasure in any but a fraction of this musicHereas with most of Shostakovichthe content they locate is a projection of what they know of its circumstances by which only a heart of stone would not be movedTake away this knowledge and the appeal would vanishfor the music is rarely able to stand on its own meritsThe second problem is the evaluation of new music that dealswith religious subject-matterhowever vagueA nostalgia has become apparentafter an era of aggressive atheismeither for the great organized beliefs or for substitutes chiming better with the would-be freer spirit of the timesIn the Sixties Gurus and pop music were the thingthe present mood is sombre and apocalypticIn boththe identification with music that attempts to express any part of this vast area tends to be one of self-deceiving empathyA spiritual void needs to be satisfiedso what is offered as serious and sacrosanct must be as good as it pretendsInstances would include the St Luke Passion by Penderecki and the St John by Arvo PartMessiaen's TransfigurationBritten's War RequiemTippett's Mask of Time and Birtwistle's Mask of OrpheusSteve Reich's Desert Musicmuch of the output of John Tavener and Jonathan Harveyabove allStockhausen's seven-day wonderLichtSuch religious/humanitarian subject-matter even the HolocaustHiroshima and Aids have not escaped makes a fortress as unassailable by criticism as the art produced under tyrannyThe worth of individual pieces isobviouslyvery variousconsistent is the appeal to pietyensuring that the elevated theme produces a warm-hearted responseThese composers are not coldly exploiting their audiences' kindnessthey are all equally the victims of the going ideologyAnd sincerity is not in questionBut the hard truthnailed with all-time accuracy by the other great composer from Leningrad the one who got outis that sincerity does not guarantee qualityMost art is sincereStravinsky addedand most art is badErsatz emotion replaces musical contentThe genuine difficulty of understanding intricate artistic designs is evaded by the factitious difficulty of being exalted or troubled by important messages which have nothing to do with musical worthArtistic value is not an extraeven in a threnody for ChernobylWithout itmessage or vision are wishful thinkingAudiences' large capacities for ersatz-importance show how eager they are to be deeply stirredhow easily gulledhow low the threshold of enjoyment must be set for music of our timeWhat little appeal it has seems to depend heavily on these impuritiesNo one would deny that music can embody great humane and religious themesThat it does soso profoundlyis a vital part of what it is forThere is spiritual value in the very handling of its primary elements to write a little song or danceeven an exerciseevenas Bruckner used to show his classesin a fifth or octave struck at a pianoThe essence of music's higher flights is transcendental in the highest degree imaginablein ways that are manifestly intelligible and effectualand quite insusceptible to verbal accountingDebussy's answer to a journalist who asked if he was familiar with heaven yesbut I don't natter about it with strangersis not so silly as it soundsEvasive certainlybut only to acknowledge what cannot be utteredThe good composer expresses what he feels and makes what he is makingfrom an essentially musical motivationby essentially musical meanswith all the skill and experience he can commandThe ends are varioushere a visionary oratoriothere an opera buffahere a craggy piano etudethere a melting morceau de salonThe degree of craftthe degree of inspirationare the measure whereby they can be valuedthrough these are achievedconsciously or inadvertentlythe heights and depths of spiritual expression whereby they are a joy for everMusic can only be judged on the basis of an attentiveness to its musical essence as sensitive and discriminating as possibleAbove allas specific an undogmatic reaction to the details in style and technique of the particular composerpieceor passageNaturally this will include transcendental subject-matter if it's thereand recognize the moments where this sweeps all before itAll the rest is emotional blackmailRECORD REVIEWS Violent measureShostakovichPiano Concerto No

SIMON MUNDYIT IS 14 years since Shostakovich diedNonetheless his reputation as at once the most searching and accessible of contemporary composers has not diminishedIf anythingfashion is moving closer to the context of his style with the passage of timeIn the 1970s his language did indeed seem a little old-fashionedNowas composers grope towards a language that satisfies audiences and yet manages to be sufficiently modernShostakovich's music sounds at the front once againThere has been a welcome pile of new recordings issued recentlynot just of the symphoniesbut of the concertos and chamber music as wellTwo of them mark the start of international recording careers for extraordinary young Soviet pianistsEvgeny Kissin and Lilya Zilbersteinwho were only children when Shostakovich diedKissinaged 18came to prominence a couple of years ago when he appeared to great acclaim at the Berlin FestivalHis recording of the First Piano Concerto is sparklingly assured crisply articulated but with enough sensitivity to convey the inevitable bitter-sweet character of the slow movementThis is anyway a stunning discthanks to the playing of the Moscow Virtuosi with SpivakovTheir performances of the orchestral arrangements the Chamber Symphony arranged by Rudolph Barshai from the Eighth Quartetand the Opus 34 Preludes arranged by Victor Poltoratsky from the piano originalare superbly polishedLilya Zilbersteinat 24is also an impressive discoveryHer first record shows her to be as musical as she is technically accomplishedThe pithy violence of Shostakovich's First Sonata does not come naturally to herbut she is at home in the limpid impressionism of Rachmaninov's G major Preludewhich on its own makes this disc worth havingThe lyrical and passionate aspects of Shostakovichrather than the bitterly satiricalalso bring out the best in Julian Lloyd Webber's playingHis elegiac tempo for the largo of the Cello Sonata allows him a sustained outpouring of feelingJohn McCabe's accompanyingtoois wonderfully supportiveThe Sonata is imaginatively coupled with Britten'swritten after his first meeting with Shostakovich in 1961The usual characters of the two composers are reversed herethere is little of the English scene-painter in Britten's Sonataand it stands as one of his most nervous and angry worksLloyd Webber and McCabeboth amiable mensense the unease and respond to it deftlyItzhak Perlman's account of Shostakovich's First Violin Concerto is a more rough-hewn affairPerlman is usually the slickest of violinistsbut here he seems to cultivate a rasping sound that emphasises the work's macabre portrait of Stalin's Russia in the late 1940sThisalong with the concerto by Shostakovich's teacher Glazunovwas recorded live in Tel Aviv in July 1988 so there is a spate of clapping at the endBut the acoustic captured by the engineers is reasonably spaciousI have reservations about Perlman and Mehta's treatment of the Glazunovthoughwhich seems neither as richly romantic as Oscar Shumsky's on Chandosnor as glittering as Anne-Sophie Mutter's on Eratothe other two versions to appear in the last yearIn this silkiest of works there needs to be an elegant bonhomiemixed with a hint of gentle sadnesswhich quite eludes the Israel PO and the soloistwho seem intent on squeezing out each last drip of sentiment surely a misunderstanding of the composer's style and aspirationsMUSIC Enlightened viewsOAE Mackerras Queen Elizabeth HallBy TESS KNIGHTONHAYDN-LOVERS are in for a good time this autumncoming up are the Haydn at Esterhaza concerts at the Wigmore Hall part of the Magyarok Britain Salutes Hungary Festivalalready on display is the Haydn and England exhibition at the British Libraryand just started is the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment's QEH Haydn series concentrating on his late choral worksThe opening concert a performance of The Creationconducted by Sir Charles Mackerras sets a high standard for the remaining seven concerts in the seriesThe ingredients were just rightthree highly intelligent soloists Lynne DawsonAnthony Rolfe Johnson and David Wilson-Johnsona small but alert choir excellently trained by Julian Clarksona top-name period-instrument orchestraand a conductor not afraid to cherish every aspect of Haydn's extraordinary scoreThis was music-making of a high orderMackerras's account was compassionate but redbloodeddirect but full of charmIt did not set out to be radically differentthough Haydn's colourful scoring was certainly enhanced by the use of period instruments including a fortepiano in the recitatives and a bass line reinforced more consistently by bass trombone and contra bassoonbut it succeeded in being unforced and unfetteredHe made the most of his superb wind sectionused the extra clarity of the strings to underline the richness of the harmonyand encouraged the brass to cut through the texture and pin down the rhythm asfor examplein the exhilarating chorus Achieved is the Glorious WorkThe audiences at the first performances of The Creation in Vienna in the late 1790s were entranced by Haydn's musical depictions of every living creature from the mighty eagle to the lowly wormOnly a short while later these were accused by Schiller amongst othersof being not worthy of him Fit only for the nurseryto use in connection with Noah's Arkbut the truth is they are irresistibleLynne Dawson's clear voice soared and trilled through The Birdsnumberwhile Wilson-Johnson's worm was creepily sinuousThis was an uplifting experience as Haydn intended it should

poetryIn one of the poems were the following linesI seem as though from a polished ship Torn Between the anchors at the dock And the currents of the seaThis doesn't workYou can't think of a ship as having an emotional life divided between the attachment to its anchors and the call of the tidesI saidShe personalizes the shipa friend of the poetess saidin a just audible squeakWelleven if the ship was you I mean if you were the ship it would be absurdI arguedbeginning to feel dizzyHowever I could see that the class was against meCrushed ambitions and women's lib feelings had rallied to the author's right to identify herself with a polished shipWhen I got back to my apartment I ate some ham and beansand opened a bottle of rather rust-coloured claretI ate too much and drank nearly

mediocre and embittered water-colourist who eventually turned to another medium mass emotion and warfareThe Fuhrer loves art because he is himself an artistGoebbels announced in a contemporary newsreelat whichno doubtall genuine artists looked uneasily towards the borderThis is still not an easy subject-matter when the Royal Academy put together its recent retrospective of German Art in the Twentieth-Centuryit dealt with the Nazi years by ignoring them altogether a decision that put it in line with the orthodox view of the work's quality and conveniently avoided the embarrassing possibility that these works kitschsunlit expressions of heroic physical vigour and serene landscape might still prove more popular than German expressionismOmnibus's simplistic script favoured show-and-tell over analysis but that dangerous moral that these years were a triumph of popular taste in artnot a suppression of it could be glimpsed now and thenThe Nazis didn't invent stylesthe narration pointed outthey occupied those that already existedIn some cases this was rather literally the case the syrupy domestic interiors beloved of German nineteenth-century painters began to reappear with pictures of the Fuhrer on the wall and the Volkischer Beobachter lying folded on the tableElsewhere the co-option was more subtlethe addition of the word Germanto a landscape painting would usually guarantee its successOmnibus chronicled all this with exemplary thoroughness but finally elided the real aesthetic questions of a battle between art that invites the viewer to think and art that passes through the mind leaving only a sugary trace of complacent pleasureAesthetic judgements are impossiblethe narration concludeda denial which implied that paintings are only as good or bad as the political opinions of those that paint themEarlier we had been told that some lasciviousnudes were a sign of increasing decadence at the centre of an inflexible regimea phrase with some deeply troubling echoes of vocabularyThat this filmof all filmswas prepared to judge paintings merely as symptoms of moral decaywas a little startlingMUSICALS Bows of HollyMark Steyn reviews London's

Roll On Friday is one that very soon has you echoing its title's wish that time would pass more rapidlyIn its attempt to satirise an institution supposedly dominated by tediumrepetition and pointlessnessit perversely contrives to consist of little but these things itselfThe setting is Room 133the stores branch of a vast government department in WellingtonNew ZealandInto this cluttered little office on a wet and windswept Monday morning in 1974 burst five of its personnelIn accordance with the procedures governing Roger Hall's comedythey do so at regularly-spaced intervalseach entering with a gasp and clad in a ridiculous profusion of scarveshats and rainwearso that his droll point about the awfulness of the country's climate can be adequately appreciatedIt is usual in this office comedyyou quickly discoverfor jokes to be transmitted at least in triplicateOftenthe same bit of flimsy facetiousness gets disgorged with a frequency that suggests the whole thing is a product of some mechanically chortling Xerox machineEvery 20 minutes or sothe play guffawingly alludes to the non-arrival of some long-ordered calculatorsWhen they finally appearthey turn out in what for this play amounts to a considerable comic twist to have been fitted with the wrong plugAs a human variant on such running or lumbering gagsthere is Wallya farcically uncooperative caretaker who puts in a regulation grumpy appearance in each of the play's four scenes in order to enunciate his catchphraseNothing to do with meMuch of the play's humour comes straight from stockThere are jests about administrative gaffes 'overtrousers' mistyped as overt rousersor about the craziness of bureaucracy the staff have no order forms because they have run out of order forms with which to order themTraditional sniggerings are amply catered fortooThe office's tubby female employee is the constant butt of lines likeOf course you're not fatBerylpull up a couple of chairs and sit down'Mind my yoghurt'she squeals when a workmate squeezes her breastsA further dismal feature of the evening is Hall's penchant for the unsurprising surprisePredictablya much-mentioned colleague absent on sick-leave gets the job two of the characters on stage are rivals forLumps of pathos intermittently introduce a note of sentiment into all of thisTwo of the men turn out to have family problemsPlump Beryl who talks to the office cactus is lovelornit is revealedThe awkward changes of tone caused by these disclosures are managed with some skill by the Watford castall of whom also do their impressive best to polish up the lustreless comic lines they are lumbered withIn particularSimon Slater as the sarky office cad and Annette Badland as Beryl put in performances far above the level of the sitcom scriptMade up of four 30-minute scenesin each of which the same people say and do the same things in the same settingRoll On Fridayit is no surprise to learnhas been developed into a five-year television series in New Zealand and AustraliaThe only way in which it even faintly stirs your brain cells is in causing you to wonder what on earth it's doing on the stage at WatfordTHEATRE Dunsinane via BaliMacbeth MarloweCanterburyBy ALEX RENTONACTORS have researched Shakespeare in prisonszooshospitalsDavid Garrick constructed his Lear in a lunatic asylumstudying an old man who had managed to drop his daughter out of a windowRather more fun and doubtless just as fruitful was the Odyssey Theatre Company's research for their Macbethsix weeks spent with the support of the Scottish Arts Council on the Indonesian island of BaliThe official justification is that in Bali the company could work with local performers and learn to shift our centres of gravity away from the headdown into the centres of our bodiesOn stage this is translated into the uncomfortable standing squat familiar from karate moviesknees splayed and bottom outIn Baliwe are also toldlife can be spent among people who daily interact with the forces of good and evil in natureThis is the only really objectionable thing about Odyssey's odysseya daily communion with good and evil is not in any way the experience of the characters in MacbethThe intervention is extraordinaryand to think of it otherwise risks ignoring how the interest of the play lies in the psychologicalin the testing of our sympathy and understanding of the MacbethsWe get little of thatInstead there is a designer's traveloguethe production no director is listedbut Nigel Jamieson heads the companyveers all over the Far East and indeed round to the CaribbeanIt sports an instructor in kabukiand much seems Japanesethe costumesthe men's top-knots and a fair part of the staging seem to come from KurosawaFor the domestic scenes and these include the most moving Slaughter of the Macduffs sequence I have seen we come right back to European naturalismThere are many other good things in the productiona passionate and gripping Lady Macbeth from Clare Benedictwitches dressed to look like maggotsand fight scenes that presumably use the Balinese experience in becoming savage death dancesThe musicusing Gamelan instrumentsis a pleasurethough it can occasionally obscure the textFocus is often concentrated on the youngand on Emma Bernard who plays both Fleance and Macbeth's sonAt the play's opening she stands centre stagesilent in a white shiftuntil a stab brings red cascading from her bellyThe point seems to be that Macbeth's greatest crime is in tampering with the futureButas so often when a design idea takes over a productionan awful lot gets missedThe text has been cut quite wantonly and only for expediencyyou feelIan Halcrow's Macbeth looks great but never draws us closeand he and others swallow or truncate their lines as though they cared very little for themThisaccording to the programmeis Kechaka Balinese vocal technique involving complex cross-rhythms and syncopationsThe talents of this company are obviousit will be interesting to see what they do nextespecially if the research happens at homein London
