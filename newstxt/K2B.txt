he was saddened but not surprised that he had been sacked after admitting he does not believe in GodThe Rev Anthony Freeman said he felt a great sense of relief when he admitted to himself he did not hold to the traditional view of GodHe was dismissed from his post as director of post-ordination training by the Bishop of ChichesterDr Eric Kempafter being told his views were incompatible with his jobI was saddened that it was felt I had to go but I suppose it was unsurprisinghe saidMr Freeman said he believed in a Christian humanism which meant God was merely the sum of human aspirationsrather thana supernatural being intervening in man's affairsIn a bookGod In Uspublished next monthwhich his refusal to withdraw from publication led to his sackinghe saidThere is nothing out thereand if there iswe can have no knowledge of itMr Freeman46is being allowed to stay as priest-in-charge of St Mark'sStaplefieldWest Sussexfor a yearThe bishop said he would review my situation after EasterI infer from that that if my views are modified in a direction he approves ofI might stayBut probably the chances are that I will be looking for some sort of changehe addedMr Freeman said some parishioners were upset by his views but the majority were supportiveWhat I am pleading for is a widening of belief from the received views of GodI have been released to find a new sense of freedom in
