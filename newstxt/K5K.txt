Golden eaglesI read with dismay the report by Auslan Cramb 11 Marchconcerning the killing of golden eaglesThe Scottish Landowners' Federation unequivocally condemns the illegal killing of protected birdsThe SLF recommends to its members that in their own interestsand in the interests of their employeesthey rebrief their staff on the need to use only legal means of managementA clause to that effect should also be included in any contract of employmentWe have a draft available on applicationBird numbersI would like to reassure Ian McLaren Points of Viewtodaythat garden birds on the West Coast are thrivingDespite a resident magpie this year's nest building has already begun birds visiting the garden daily include blue titgreat titlong-tailed tit and coal titsiskingreenfinchsparrowsblackbirdsthrushesrobins and at the last count 11 chaffinchesRegular visitors include two wood pigeonsseven collar dovesinnumerable rooks and jackdawsNatural predatorssparrowhawk and kestrelswoop in on regular raids and the garden is visited by fox and weaselMy garden could be described as bird friendlyhaving ample cover for roostingplenty of berries and seed headsFrom November to April wild-bird food is available once a day and nuts are suspended in a holderClean drinking water is supplied and this is as important as a varied diet to encourage birds to the gardenThe birds are thereMr McLarenif you supply the correct environmentIvy benefitsContrary to popular mythand the suggestion of your recent correspondent Points of View10 Marchivy is not a menace to treesand indeed is not a parasite in any senseIt feeds from its own roots in the ground and a healthy tree will normally be unaffected by itIn a tree which is already moribund the remaining healthy crown may be suppressedbut the loss of the individual tree is far outweighed by the conservation benefitsIvy is an essential component of the best woodland habitats in Britain and often provides the only available evergreen shelter in winterIts dense growth provides nesting places for a range of bird life as well as warm cover in winter or roosting small birdsIt is also a winter retreat for butterflies and other insectsThe flowers provide abundant nectar at a time when hardly any other source is available and throughout the autumn the last foraging beeswasps and a host of flies are attracted to themThe berries are eaten by most species of the large thrush familyand by many other birdsSoplease think carefully before you take an axe to any ivy and consider the harm that may be done to countless woodland birds and insectsMore magpiesI was interested to read recent letters expressing concern at the absence of small birdsI too was very worried at the increase in numbers of magpiesThis area of Falkirk has always had a resident population of these handsome but predatory birdsVery near by is Maggie Woods Loanwhich is named after the birdI am delighted to report that despite the increase both of magpies and crows last yearI have observed over the winter feeding period the usual mixture of birdsThis included four kinds of titthree varieties of finchgoldcrestwren andof coursethe ubiquitous robinall contributing to a total of approximately 20 speciesI am looking forward to the usual summer visitorsPlaying hard to getWELLnot everyone is turned on by talking dirtyThe attempt to entice six male sperm whales out of Scapa Flow by playing them some fruity dialogue recorded at a whales' hen night off the Azores has so far failedWith great foresightthe scientists operating this marine 0898 line had also brought a tape of a large male whale saying whatwe know not presumably in case these werewellthe sort of lads who don't like girlsThat didn't ring their bells eitherAll that emanated from the depths were some huffy clicking noiseswhich is apparently the sound of a whale not being turned onThatand a few water spoutsbut then boys will be boysThe scientists hope to try again todaywhich shows commendable patienceTrying to vamp a bunch of vagrant whales in the Pentland Firth in March armed only with a waterproof tannoy and a box of plain-wrapped tapes is not everyone's idea of a good timeBy all accountsit is not habit-formingalthough recordings of ritzy whale chat are apparently popular as an optional extra with those flotation chamber gadgets that the metropolitan smart set use to stave off the ennui of being rich and stupidStillthis ploy of trying to shift people with sounds is clearly catching onPossibly it has its origins in the white noisetechniques which the Britsever the innovatorspioneered in Northern Ireland in the 1970s it has always seemed unjust that what was deplored then as a human rights abuse was later marketed under the brand name of acid houseThe most famous exampleof coursewas when the Americans blasted General Noriega with poorly-reviewed heavy metal albumsSomething of the sort is being tried again at WacoPerhaps the boffins in the boats at Scapa ought to swallow their compassion and get equally coercive with the whalesInstead of towing amplified sweet nothings ahead of the schoolthey might do better to sit astern with a few well-chosen selections from The Osmonds' Greatest Hitsor SingalongamaxWellwouldn't it work for you
