Captain James Hook has somehow escaped from the jaws of the ticking crocodile to dream of a return engagement with the leader of the Lost BoysThere is also the small point that the original Peter had

anyone remain unconvincedI rest my case on the Leaning Tower of Pisa syndromeWhen the tower was being constructed at the end of the 12th centuryit started keeling overAs a resultit has become one of the great monuments of the world and a national symbollike the Eiffel Towerthe Statue of Liberty and the Great Wall of ChinaIf anyone points out that these artefacts have achieved international renown while remaining perfectly uprightI shall sulk and not reveal the most significant point in last night's QED BBC1documentaryPropping Up PisaNamelythat the last people who want the tower restored to the vertical are the PisansAt a strokethey would lose a flourishing tourist trade and their place on the world mapQED indeedOn the other handas Cynthia Page's fascinating and delightful documentary revealedif something isn't done PDQall they will have is a pile of marble rubbleGood for tourism in the short termmaybeHardly a long-term investmentMost people who have visited Pisa know that the Torre Pendente began toppling while it was still being builtFew will previously have been aware that it started out leaning the other waythen righted itselfand after a 100-year gap when the money ran

aboutCharles Mansonterrorists and Steve Biko feature in new operasGeoffrey Wheatcroft wonders if murder strikes quite the right noteBy GEOFFREY WHEATCROFTIN DR JOHNSON's all too familiar phraseopera is an exotic and irrational entertainmentIs it becoming more irrational and exotic than it can handleSeveral recent or forthcoming operas sound as if they were designed for or perhaps by what in Soho are known as people of strange and unusual tastesThese works raise a serious question as to whether their subjects are suitable cases for treatment that isby librettists and composersThe Death of Klinghofferwith music if that's the wordby John Adamshad its European premiere in Brussels last yearIt is based on a real-life episode of seven years agothe murder of an elderly Jewish-American tourist on a Mediterranean cruise ship by Palestinian terroristsNext month sees the world premiere in Birmingham of Bikoby Priti Paintal and Richard FawkesAnd now comes John Moran's operaThe Manson FamilyThis work was commissioned by the Lincoln Center in New York for its Serious Funfestival and performed recently with the composer himself playing the mass murdererwhose victims included the actress Sharon TateNow opera has rarely been a naturalistic mediumand never an understated oneFor more than its first hundred yearsin the 17th and 18th centuriesits stories were all set in classical antiquitySome were based on historical fact L'Incoronazione di PoppeaGiulio Cesare but most were mythologicalAnd the most outre modern librettist makes no advance in terms of weirdness or bloodthirstiness on these taleshave a look at the story of Orfeo or Idomeneohuman sacrifice and allThe great advance in Mozart's time was operas set in the here and nowSome of these were again off-beat or disturbingthe stories of Cos fan tutte and Fidelio are both shocking in their waythough both are supposedly based on real lifeIn the early 19th centurythe historical opera was reborn in Italy under the impact of the Romantic movementSchiller's plays and Scott's poems and novelsDespite the way these are sometimes now stagedthese ottocento operas were meant to be taken seriouslyAnd they dealt with gruesome subjectsOne of the very first of them was Rossini's Elisabetta Regina d'Inghilterrawhich revolves around a real enough subjectthe execution of what might now be called political prisonersVerdi's Don Carlos just opened at the ENO in a fine new production contains an auto-da-fe sceneAnd Wagner's operas are in a class of their ownbloodthunderand a sex scene in which a chap gets off with his sisterAnd yet we are shocked we are certainly meant to be by daringcontemporary operasThe ENO's stagings of Henze's The Bassarids still more classical mythology with Bacchic orgies and killingsand Greek by Mark Anthony Turnage with a foul-mouthedviolent libretto after Steven Berkoffwould fall into this categoryENO is distressed that opera has not generally been the property of the youngest type of creative talentAnd so it has now set its education and outreachdepartment to encourage young people from across Britain to use their music and song to tell their storiesThe New VisionsNew Voices initiative is restricted to anyone under 30But among the oldies who have given the project their support are Malcolm McLaren and Elvis Costellowhich suggests that the ENO is looking for something a little off the beaten operatic tracknot to say strange and unusualThese strange and unusual subjects may be relevant but will they be suitableAs I wrote on this page recentlyopera is barely a living art form any longerThe living operaof today is arguably the musicalUntil not long ago that formtoohad its conventionsand on the whole steered clear of unsuitableor even grown-up subjectsThere were exceptionsagainlike Carouselwhich is being revived at the National Theatre later this yearand which has a plot bizarre by Verdi's standardsThen came SondheimHis shows are serious and grown-upby his lightsand they certainly have storylines so odd as to make The Ring look like a sit-comSondheim's latest New York musicaldue here in the autumnis The AssassinsOne of its characters from real life is Squeaky Frommeshe who tried to assassinate President Gerald Fordwho sings a duet with John Warnock Hinckleythe would-be assassin of President Ronald ReaganAnd Squeakyit may be rememberedwas a member of the Manson familyIt might say something about the Americans that they remain so obsessed with this repellentperverted killer and his pathetic entourageBut it may say something also about the condition of the musical theatre that this subject has caught the attention of two composersIn the endno subject is too serious for opera to treator necessarily too unpleasantor too poignantWhat matters is how it is handledPerhaps the most unbearably poignant opera of the last half-century is The Emperor of Atlantiswhich was written in Theresianstadt concentration campwhile composer and librettist waited to be sent to AuschwitzThe poignancy of that piece is the circumstance of its compositionnot its subject matterAn opera set in the camps would be a very different thingThere areafter allconsiderations of taste orif that's too namby-pambyof simple decencyOf coursethe subject can be dramatic and terribleSteve Bikoa brave and remarkable man who met a tragic death in the course of a patriotic strugglethis is the very stuff of operaAny number of romantic operas likewise deal with patriotic heroesfrom Rossini's William Telljust revived at the Royal Operato Smetana's Dalibor which is due for a revivalBut it all depends on the treatmentThis is what is wrong with KlinghofferThe murdered tourist left a widow whose permission was not asked before the work was writtenAdams was the composer of the minimalistscore which means that its musical content is minimaland his librettist was Alice Goodmanbut its begetter was the ubiquitous director Peter Sellarswhose work is clevergiftedsilly and campThere was indeed something rebarbative as there may prove to be about The Manson Family when and if we see it on stage here about the use of a serious story for a work which struck many as frivolous and even posturingOpera can take almostif not quiteany subject and make something worthwhile of itWhat matters is the makingThe ArtsGay's dark laughterBy CHARLES SPENCERAFTER a dismal start to the new Stratford season with Bill Alexander's glum staging of The Taming of the Shrewit is good to report that the RSC has quickly recovered its form with a splendidly enjoyable production of The Beggar's OperaDespite the fame of John Gay's ballad operawhich broke all box-office records when it opened in 1728it is performed surprisingly rarely these daysI still shudder at the memory of the only previous production I've seenwhich attempted to drag this 18th-century masterpiece kicking and screaming into the 20th century with the help of rap and reggae music and rewritten dialogue that sounded like a rejected Minder scriptJohn Caird makes no such mistake at the Swan TheatreThis is an ensemble show in the RSC's great tradition of Nicholas Nickleby and Les Miserables Caird was co-director of both with Trevor Nunnand it could well repeat their success at the box officeRight from the start the production creates a seething sense of lifeas the underworld characters swarm over Kendra Ullyart's ramshackle wooden set of tilted balconies and laddersThe effect is of an animated Hogarth painting andlike Hogarth's workThe Beggar's Opera combines a surface vitality with a bleak and bitter vision of fallen humanityCaird's achievement is to capture the sheer energy of the piece while also doing justice to its underlying darknessFears that the staging might be a little too picturesque are quickly dispelled as realistic dummies drop from the ceiling on ropes and dangle above the actors' headsThe shadow of the gibbet is a constant presence in The Beggar's OperaGay conjures up a nightmarish worldin which thief-takersinform on fellow criminals for the £40 rewardmarriage for love is regarded as a family disgraceand man is presented as an animal of preyEvery one of us preys upon his neighbourand yet we herd togethersays Lockitthe Newgate jailerand Caird's production memorably suggests the huddledvicious humanity of London low-lifeIt's also a real pleasure to encounter a show with so many fine tunesGay added his own elegant and often ironic lyrics to traditional airs and ballads which have been atmospherically arranged by Ilona Sekacz for an excellent bandWithout the radio mikes which have become de rigueur in most musicalssome of the solo singing sounds a little thinand it's a shame that Gay's excellent words aren't always audibleBut a few rough edges are welcome in these days of vacuousglossy musicalsand numbers like Over the Hills and Far Away and Macheath's bitter hymn about Tyburn Tree to the tune of Greensleeves are beautifully performedThere are some great set pieces a brilliantly evoked highway robberywith Macheath's gang riding invisible horses and commandeering a stage coach suggested by just a table and a few boxesand a grotesque parade of whoressome of them played by men in dragin which the ladies of the night emerge through a trap-door like beauty contestants from hellSome of the individual performances could do with more definition and detailbut there's terrific work from David Burtwho has exactly the right mixture of romantic swagger and ruthless cynicism as Macheathas well as a first-rate singing voicePaul Jesson has some memorable moments of pitch-black comedy as the fence and thief-taker Peachumas well as sudden outbursts of vicious violence that wipe the smile right off your faceAs Polly Peachum and Lucy LockitElizabeth Renihan and Jenna Russell battle entertainingly for Macheath's dark heartand there's strong support from Susan Jane-Tanner as an entertainingly sour Mrs PeachumAnthony O'Donnell as a rotund LockitNick Holder as a hilarious Brummie highwayman and from Alan Cox as the beggar who has supposedly written the operaIt is he who draws the moraldeclaring that the low-life characters are no worse than the corrupt ruling classthe only difference being that the poor are punished for their vicesHis reluctant agreement to append an entirely unconvincing but uproariousy stagedhappy ending to the show is a coup de theatre that still seems strikingly modern more than 250 years after the premiere of this bracing comedyThe

intentions that they would ever become constantly updated guidebooks for the use of millionsSo what is to be doneBan his booksbecause they are a bit out of dateTo do so would be to deprive English art

considered the highlight of the evening's entertainmentand his brisees volees little beats of the feet as he appeared to fly through the air amazed even the Russianson the company's original visit to the MaryinskyShaw joined the company in 1944 and was still only 17 when Ashton used him as one of the three male dancers in Symphonic VariationsAshton continued creating roles for him in Birthday OfferingMonotones and Ondine Act IIIand he excelled as the Blue Boy in Les PatineursAll that Shaw lacked to become a danseur noble were the necessary inchesHis medium stature condemned him to character parts unless a choreographer created something especially for himas John Cranko did in Prince of the Pagodas and Bonne-Bouche and Kenneth MacMillan in NoctambulesA Yorkshiremanhe was born Brian Earnshaw on June 281928and was taught by Mary Shaw and Ruth French before joining the Sadlers Wells later RoyalBallet SchoolShaw was one of the star pupils of Vera Volkovawho taught both the

swift little steps close to the groundShawin ballets like Les Rendezvousembodied everything that was best about Ashton's choreography and which made the Royal Ballet uniqueHis career as a virtuoso dancer came to an end in the 1960swhen he suffered an injurybut he continued to take on character partsnotably as the widow Simone in Ashton's Filleand remained with the company until 1989From 1972 he was also a dancing master and served as principal teacher until his final illness in 1991The Royal Ballet remained very much the centre of Shaw's worldand his pithy comments revolved around its artistic and social manoeuvresbut the mainspring of his life the glory and challenge of being a supreme athlete and artist on stage could not be replacedIntelligent and wittyShaw became somewhat embitteredand at times his company teaching could seem perfunctoryHe seldom correctedand could not bring himselfas company teachers shouldregularly to attend company performances to watch his pupils
