for the girlsTime for a second honeymoonMy mother has died and left me £1,000I haven't had a holiday for ten yearsnot since our honeymoonWe had three children in quick successionand no spare cashMy sisterwho has always been better off than ushas suggested that I should go abroad with her this yearand says I have no excuse because I have the money and that is what our mother would have wanted me to do with itMy husband has made it clear he doesn't agree to me goingMy sister was divorced two years agoand he doesn't really get on with herI really would like a holidaybut I don't want to spend a lot of moneyand then come home and find an atmosphereWENDY SAYSI can't help wondering whyif you want a holiday so muchyou don't invite your husband to have one with you and you payIt's about time for a second honeymoonI would have thoughtI'm not surprised he's feeling peevedHow would you feel if the boot was on the other footand he was suggesting he went and spent all that money going away with his foot-loose and fancy-free brotherI would suggest you think againbecause you also have the children to think aboutI'm sure they would enjoy a family holidayand my guess is that your mother would approve as wellI AM saddened and appalled by an incident which happened two months ago when a female security guard chasing a thief knocked my 67-year-old mother off her feetThankfully she was attended to by another ladyLuckily my mother was not seriously hurtbut the woman responsible has not felt the need to enquire how my mother isDoes humanity go out of the window when a woman security
