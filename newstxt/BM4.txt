Family burgled yet againA GANG of professional thieves who staked out a house in Bentworth last week got away with a £20,000 caravanNow the angry ownerwhose home has been burgled four times this yearis offering a £500 reward for informationTwenty-three year-old Allen Taylor is sick and tiredof the continuing attacks on his parents' house and is appealing for helpThe latest raid at Ashley Road happened between 6 p.m. and 7.15 p.m. on Friday eveningIt is believed that the gang had been watching the property from a nearby fieldTwo days before they strucka sensor light set up outside the house was smashedThe Swift Challenger 490 caravan had been parked in the driveway behind another vehiclebut the thieves were undeterred and made their move under the cover of darkness soon after two members of the family left the homeThey forced their way onto adjoining land and cut through chain-link fencing and large wooden posts cemented into the groundGap in the fenceThe gang manhandled the 18-foot caravan through the gap in the fence and began pushing it across the field towards the roadWhen the villains were unable to get the caravan up a small inclinethey hitched it to a stolen vehicle and wheel-spun their way onto the roadOnce they were outside the groundsthe thieves dumped one vehicle and used another to make their get-awaywith the cream coloured caravan in towThe daring raid was executed in minutesaccording to Mr. TaylorMy mother had taken my little brother to tennis at Winchesterhe saidMy 20-year-old sister was at home alone when they struckShe heard the three dogs barkingbut before she went to see what was upthe phone rang She was only on the phone for a minute but that was all it tookA short while later his mother  and brother arrived home to discover the caravan goneThey immediately phoned Allenwho has a car business at Lower Wieldand he set off in pursuit of the gangI drove home and then followed the road into Altonbut I could find no sign of themhe saidI stopped a policeman in the High Street and he radioed in the information I gave himIn the meantimemy dad had arrived at the house and spotted two men hanging around the ditched vehicleWhen they saw him they just sped offAllen is certain that somebody must have seen the caravan at some point that eveningWith the narrow lanes around Bentworthany approaching traffic would have had to give way and cars travelling in the same direction could have been held upIf no-one saw the caravan being towed along any of the main roads in the areathen Allen believes the gang may have stored it somewhere in the vicinityHe is appealing for anyone who saw the caravan or knows of its whereabouts to contact himAnyone who gives me the information that leads to these people will get the reward moneyhe saidHoweverhe is also keen to hear from residents who have also suffered at the hands of thievesBeing burgled four times since the start of the year is something you'd associate with the inner-cities but this is BentworthAnyone who has information about the gang or the caravan can contact Mr. Taylor at his work on 0256 389000We must stop this motoring madnessRESIDENTS CALL FOR ACTIONSPEEDING motorists are putting lives in danger at Holybourneand worried residents are certain that an accident is waiting to happenTheir fears which focus on a stretch of the old London Road have led to calls for action and improvementsVillagers are especially concerned for the safety of children and youngsters who play on a small triangle of grass underneath the bypassDespite continued campaigning for a playground or field which seems to have hit a brick wall they have still nowhere else in Holybourne for them to gothe Herald was toldResidents also fear that people using the only regularly served bus stop in the village up on the A31 bypass bridge are being placed at riskPedestrians going down the steps from the bus stop are hidden by trees and shrubs and have to either walk in the road or cross over to find a pavementOne anxious motherJane BrookssaidAs people drive through and then out of the centre of Holybourne they seem to forget that speed restrictions still applyMany seem to increase their speed so that by the time they take the left hand fork to Cuckoo's Corner pick your own farmthey are often doing speeds over 50mphMrs Brooks' dog was almost run over recently as she was putting her into the carShe was lucky not to be hurt and so was the driver of the vehicleconsidering the distance he skidded and the strength with which he had to apply his brakesMrs. Brooks addedResidents say that the farm and shopopen seven days a weekattract a steady flow of traffic which increases greatly in the summer fruit seasonMrs. Brooks continuedPerhaps it is the re-routeing of the old A31 that has left some confusion as to the designation of this stretch of London RoadIt has no lamppostsroads or markingsmaintenance of any highway controls at allVillages are hoping that something can be done to stop traffic leaving Holybourne's main road at high speedTheir proposals are for a traffic-calming ramp or similar deviceor even just a sign reminding drivers of the speed limitA letter voicing the residents' fears and improvement suggestions was sent to the East Hampshire Road Safety Council earlier this monthThe matter was discussed and referred to the council's working party for investigationThey will be meeting at the beginning of AprilTalking of politicsPROSPECTIVE Parliamentary candidates for the Winchester constituency will share a platform at St. Laurence Church

thatalthough Blackmoor churchyard was in Selborne parishit was Whitehill Town Council who gave grants towards upkeepThe Whitehill finance committee agreed to suggest an arrangement with Selborne Parish Council to pay grants on alternate yearsProposing thisMichael Watkinson addedAs we paid last yearpossibly they could contribute this yearMembers were told that the last grave space was dealt with in Februaryalthough there were still double depth family spacesPlaces reserved for the burial of cremated remains were not likely to be filled for many years if everWhitehill Town Council contributed £250 this year and £150 last year towards the upkeep of the groundsCouncil and committee chairman Don Mayes pointed out that a number of those buried at Blackmoor were from their parishIt was unlikely that Selborne residents would want to be buried thereDr. Watkinson said there were far more former Selborne residents than Whitehill residents in the Blackmoor churchyardThe council had a

cutting gear to remove the roof of a carThe exercise was to get the victim out of the vehicleand the tool used gave as little vibration as possible to minimise further distressNew developments boost village infrastructureTHE start of the installation of the drainage system and the installation of the pelican crossing on the A31 were two of the major developments which had happened during the yearFour Marks Parish Council chairman Peter Hobbs said in his report to the annual village meetingThe policy of restraint upon development declared by county and district councils in their local plans was one of the best pieces of news he was able to report to the meetingThe basic concept was that there should be a period of restraint to redress the balance of what has been a tremendous amount of development over the yearshe saidreferring to the support the parish council had given to county and district while they were drawing up their local plansThe advent of the district plan as a firm guideline for planning decisions had caused developers to step up their efforts to open up landfor example along Brislands Lane and Blackberry Laneand it would be halfway through the year before the outcome would be knownWindmill Fields and the Lymington Bottom triangle had been definitely listed as open spaceand once landscaping work has been done both these areas will be handed over to the parish council for maintenanceFunds from the Benian Trust had been earmarked for renovating the car parking areas at the recreation ground and to reinstate the service road between the putting green and tennis courtsA grant had been obtained for de-silting Swelling Hill PondThe parish council were not altogether happy with the road layout around the new pelican crossingMr. Hobbs reportedThere were various other complaints about this voiced during the open section of the meeting which followedCars had been seen dodging through the lay-by to avoid red lightsit was saidand the pedestrian refuge between the road and lay-by was not wide enough to stand with a pramAn information office is shortly to be set up by East Hampshire District Council to answer queries about the drainage work taking place in the villageAn application to set up a pharmacy in the villagewhich would threaten the services offered by GPs in Four Marks and Ropleyhad been turned downbut was due to go to appealAfter the formal business of the meeting had been concludedthe district council's community and leisure services manager Nigel Lockley gave a short talk on the work of his departmentand how their remit has been reshaped by the introduction of the business concept to local council servicesEnabling and partnership are concepts we now live with day to dayhe said helping people help themselvesThere are four main divisions of their worksport and recreationcountryside managementarts and community development and tourismIn the first categorythe competitive tendering and subsequent running under five-yearly contract of Alton Sports Centregave an example of the new ideas at workPartnerships had enabled the use of community schools at Liphook and Bordon to be run so as to offer their facilities to the public throughout the yearand the new methods had reduced the inevitable deficit of the sports centre to well below the national averageIt had not been an easy concept to grasp at firstbut we're getting better at being businessmenMr. Lockley saidThey employ two rangers to look after the district's 1,200 footpathsand work with farmers and landowners to make sure these well-used rights of way are kept in good conditionCommunity services involve organisations of all kindsfrom Citizens' Advice Bureaux to WIsto badminton clubs and playgroups meeting in village hallsThe impact of their input to this kind of organisation was hard to assesshe commentedThe only way to know whether we are doing any good would be to take us away for a yearWe are trying to work closer with

homely care and attentionnow is the time to get involvedAlton Social Services are hoping to attract a lot of new foster carers in the Alton and Bordon areas to coincide with National Foster Weekand a change in the whole concept of foster careFamily placement team members will be manning stalls at Alton market on Tuesday and at the Forest CentreBordonon Thursdayto reinforce information broadcast nationwide during a week-long television campaignThe emphasis will be on a more active type of short-term fosteringaccording to family placement social worker Jane EmblingSince the recent introduction of the Children's Actthe aim has been to work more closely with the natural parentswith a view to returning youngsters to their own homes as quickly as possibleThis has meant a change in the role of carers and a move towards short-term placementWhen considering long-term placement we will be looking more at adoptionexplained JaneLocal authoritiesThere are currently 79,000 children and young people being cared for by the local authorities in the U.K. and half of them are looking for foster homesIn the Alton and Bordon areathere is a constant trickle of demandmainly for short-term fosteringsays the placement workerwho is convinced thatas the social services go out into the community and find out what is neededthe demand for short-term fostering will growThere will be a role for every age group within fosteringwhether they are couplessingle parents or single people without children of their ownThe only qualification will be experience of lifeplus a motivation to want to help and to offer your own home to a young personsaid JaneAnd your home doesn't have to be a palaceWhen fostering out a childplacement workers will be looking for a home similar to their ownQuality of care is far more important than the quality of the surroundings in which they liveadded JaneWhat we are looking for is loving care and attention in the homePotential carers will naturally expect to be thoroughly vetted and would be required to undertake an eight-week training course before being entrusted with the care of a childwhich could take anything up to six monthsFostering is not an instant thingwarned Janebut it is well worth the waitIt is a very rewarding jobCarersThis latest campaign to enrol more foster carers within the area will be followed by an open evening at the Elizabeth

politicians have now mounted the campaign trail in earnest with the days rapidly whittling down to April 9thTo date four firm candidates have put their names forward to fight the traditionally safe Conservative East Hampshire seatOpposition parties face an uphill struggle in their battle to depose long-standing Tory member Michael Mateswho in the 1987 general election polled the largest Tory vote in the countryHoweverhis opponents are convinced that even in true-blue East Hampshire Tory popularity is on the waneAnd they believe thatif nothing elseMr. Mates is in for shockWith their hats already in the ring are Sue Baring Liberal DemocratJim Phillips Labourand Ian Foster Green PartyThe East Hampshire Independent Progressive Association ruled out fielding a candidate to allow them to concentrate their resources on local electionsBut voters could have another choice on their ballot papersIn an extensive media publicity campaign last week the Natural Law Party announced they would be fielding candidates in each constituencyAt the time of writing they had not selected anyone to contest East Hampshire but a spokesman did not rule out the possibility before nominations closedMICHAEL MATESConservativeFOLLOWING a 20-year career in the ArmyMichael Matesnow 57was elected for the then Petersfield constituency in 1974holding the seat in 1979 with an increased majorityHe won the new East Hampshire seat in 1983retaining it in 1987 with a majority of 23,786Said Mr. MatesThis is the most important election for a generationAs we move into the single marketit is more important than ever we keep our inflation level at or below those of our competitorsIt is quite clear that opposition's spending plans will lead to higher inflationJohn Major is the only leader committed to striving for zero inflationThe radical changes in the health service long overdue are bearing fruitLocally the signs are clearThe new hospital and surgery in Petersfieldthe health centre in Bordon and the closing of oldout-dated institutions have brought vast improvement to our peopleAn extra £3 billion has been allotted to the NHS this yearWe have kept our pledge to protect pensions from inflation for 13 yearsOn top of thatproportionately more has gone to those who have only their state pension by way of benefitsWe must do still moreand we shallThe craziest policy of all is to

not building eitherMr. Phillipsaged 51concludesI would invite anyone who is uncertain to visit a school or hospital to see the chronic underfunding and low staff moraleUntil these problems are

locally and from more distant partsto visit us during the celebrationshe saidBentley School was built 150 years ago on half an acre of land given by Bishop Sumner of Winchester but its history prior to 1882 is almost non-existent since the log books for the early years have long since been lostBut from the log books of 100 years agothere is a very vivid picture of school life in BentleyMain

August since the hop kilns were needed in SeptemberWith the coming of the first world warthe children of Bentley School were soon busy with their own war efforts they had a collection for the Blue Cross Fund for horses and a War Loan Savings Association was formedA war school garden was started in 1917 with some 20 boys planting potatoesin October the records show that Each of the 20 boys received about 56 lbsof potatoesAcorns and horse chestnuts were collected to be used in the making of munitions and several old pupilson leave from the frontvisited the schoolIn 1918 it's disclosed thatThe managers have arranged to supply those childrenwho remainto dinner with a hot meal for a penny halfpenny per day per childEach daythe meal was made up of baked potatoes and either rice puddingsouphashed beans and vegetables or oatmeal porridgeForefathersAround the time of the renovationsthere was some discussion on handing the school over to the statebut the management committeeheaded by the rectorthe Rev. Henry MoodyconcludedThe time has not yet comefor the surrender of these schools and the forfeiting thereby of the gifts and labours of our forefathersIndeedit wasn't until 1958 that the committee's successors decided that the increase in pupils needed better amenities than the dwindling funds could provideState aid was accepted for the schoolalthough the Church still retained some controlIn recent yearsthe school has seen major changes with the enlargement and modernisation of the building to accommodate the extra children from nearby Froylefollowing the closure of the school there in 1986An entry in the school log book after the earlier renovation in 1914 might have been written todayIt statesI received a letter from the chief inspectorMr. Wynne Williamstoday saying that he wishes to congratulate the managers on the new buildingsamong the best in the countyHe addsEducationallythe school seems to have a futureIf you can help the school with photos or exhibits or would like to get involved in some wayphone 0420 23273Bentley School in 1913 before it was enlargedWildlife in focusALTON Civil Service Retirement Fellowship's recent meeting featured an illustrated talk on wildlife by photographer Denis BrightHe showed the intricacies and dangers of getting pictures at close range and explained that he used hides and scaffold towersdecoysand foods for different types of birds and animalsHe said that badgers and foxes love Madeira cakeLeisure HeraldStrong performances in sequelMONDAY After the Miracle by William Gibsonwhich continues the wonderful Helen Keller storywas produced by the Horseshoe Theatre Company at the Central StudioBasingstoke in 1990 and made such an impact that there were demands for a repeatCurrently at the Haymarket TheatreBasingstokethe theatre company are doing just thatThe full stage production has the advantage of scenery the exterior and interior of the home in the Boston area but loses the intimacy of the in-the-round presentation at the Studio theatreBut with both productions the intensity of the acting of Daryl Back as Helen Keller and Hildegard Neil as her teacher and companion Annie Sullivan was undeniable Bothwith Adrian Reynoldsthe Horseshoe's artistic directorhave been involved with the lives of these two remarkable people for 15 years or moreAdrian Reynolds produced the actresses in The Miracle Worker when in Scotland in the eightiesThis was the play which showed how Annie Sullivan taught Helen stricken deaf and blind when she was 19 months oldthe meaning of wordsa finger tip alphabetand to writeLater she mastered Braillelearned to type and later took lessons from a teacher for the deaf so that she could go to schoolthen college and later spent her life lecturing all over the worldBorn in 1880 she died in 1968The sequel now to be seen at Basingstoke involves the period in Helen's life when Annie marriesThe introduction of a male into the wonderful relationship between the two women hard though all three try to avoid a clash does end in discordBut there is a solution otherwise Helen would not have gone on to experience a triumphant lifeYou cannot fault the performances of the two main charactersThey have played the roles so often that the women must be part of their livesBut there is no sign of stalenessthe performances at the Haymarket are terrific in their strengthThese are two strong charactersoften in oppositionbut beneath the exterior conflict is the life giving bond between the two which created richness out of such a barren beginningTo match their storming performances the actor playing the husband had to be forcefultooand Peter Dayson is certainly thatThe tempo does not slacken with his appearanceif anything it increasesThere are moments of tendernesstoobeautifully expressed by the playersDespite her handicaps Helen was an attractiveintelligent womanand must have had many suitorsOne of the early ones a is in the playrefreshingly played by Simon HewittProviding moments of steadiness amid the upheavals of the lovers is Anthony Bailey giving a sound performance as the local doctorAll very impressive and a reflection on the care taken by director Adrian ReynoldsFinal performances are today Fridayand tomorrowR.F.H.

existences for an alcohol-induced escapismThe boys aim only to get one over on the girls while the girls dream of being romantically swept off their feetEach song is a well crafted pastiche on the

MISSED the first performance of Peter Thompson's Chinese Lantern Music at last year's Summer Serenadewas so delighted to hear the complete work the third in a series of commissions for local composers played by the Petersfield Area Youth Orchestra on WednesdayThe twelve cameoseach written to display the talents of individual instrumentalistsmade an enchanting effectAs well as heroic pieces for full orchestraoboeflutesbassooneuphonium and piano all had their momentsthough only in one sectionDistant Hillsdid I detect any specific Chinese influenceThe conductor was David Thomaswhose In Nubibusthe second of the serieswas a highlight of last year's festivalThe presence in the orchestra of the composer of the firstshowed just what happy family occasions these youth concerts have becomePAYOthemselves a revelation last yearhave progressed welland it is to the credit of the young string players that they were not outclassed by the windTheir thoroughly professional performance of Bizet's Overture Dr. Miracleunder Anne Claxtonreflected great credit on her trainingThe orchestra also accompanied a rousing group of music hall songsin arrangements by members of Petersfield School's 6th formVictoria ScottAnnette Pearce and Laurence EvansThe singing of the choirs was less assured here than it had been in the group of European folk songsarranged and conducted by Duncan Hanner at the start of the concertThe fresh toned singing of such favourites as AlouetteA-roving and the Skye Boat Song must have taken many of the audience back to their own school daysThe Festival Wind Bandemanating mainly from Churcher's Collegegave a highly authentic rendering of Sousa's Liberty Bellminus a piccolo perhapsbut splendid in every respectTheir Music of the Beatles made an effective contrastYouth concerts always have to include a major work written in the current CantatafashionThis year the choice fell on Richard Stilgoe's The Big Bandan updated versionfor bass soloistnarratorsinstrumentalistschorus and audience of the creation storyNo disrespect to Philip Youngthe conductoror to any of the performersbut I have to agree with the member of the audience sitting behind me who commented that it seemed more of a damp squib than a big bandOne has to question if these pieces justify the enormous amount of rehearsal they requireMention has to be made of Julia Chapman's singing of Joshuaof the trio called Full Swingwho entertained with modern jazz in the foyer as the audience arrived andinevitablythe Petersfield School Dance Band another happy familywho set out feet a-dancing in the Rose Room after the concertAnn Pinhey Petersfield OrchestraAS festival chairman I was already very heartenedbefore a note had been playedto see a 60 strong orchestra assembling before an all-but capacity audience on ThursdayThe orchestraconsisting almost entirely of local musiciansincluded a satisfying mixture of professional playersteachersamateurs and students and the audience included many faces familiar from the choirs which perform on the festival's choral eveningsIt is these cross-relations which put the festival at the heart of local music-makingIn Borodin's Overture to Prince Igor the orchestra established themselves convincingly with secure intonation and ensemble and some distinguished solo wind playingTrumpets and trombones provided bold splashes of colourbut some sections of the orchestra notably horns and violins were slow to warm upand underplayed the romantic and exotic element in the musicJudith Bailey's firmclear beat led perhaps to an unduly deliberate tempo and heaviness of phrasing in the first movement of Beethoven's Emperor Concerto and narrowly missed coinciding with the soloist at a few important junctionsIn their accompanimentsthe strings could have contributed greater warmth and colour particularly by using more vibratoSoloist Annette Servadei played beautifully with an involvement entirely free from any kind of ostentationThis suited the broad sweep of the first movement and the magical filigree of the second movement splendidlybut the finale perhaps asks for a degree of conscious showmanshipTowards the end Miss Servadei suffered several stumbles and a memory lapsewhich unsettled this listenerSibelius' Fifth Symphony was an ambitious choice but Judith Bailey's impressive grasp of the music carried both orchestra and audience through the technical difficulties to the final magnificent blaze of Nordic splendourPhilip Young Versatility at their fingertipsROMANZASRiffs and Rumbaswas an apt title for a diverse programme played by the Segovia Trio on their return to Farnham Maltings on SaturdayFresh from their Purcell Rooms success and a new recording contractthis classical guitar trio performed with their usual professionalism as they demonstratedwith undeniable successthe versatility of their instrumentHighlights of the first half were three specially adapted songs from Bizet's Carmen and the hauntingly beautiful Intermezzo by GranadosAlexander MacDonaldRoland Gallery and Vincent Lindsey Clark chose a much lighter second half to this new programmeThree South American folk songs were composed by Mr. Lindsey Clark who also arranged a rousing Flamenco Farrucca and RumbaThe slow movement from Rodrigo's Concerto de Aranjuez was skilfully adapted for three guitars and was well suited to the resonant bass instrument of Mr. MacDonaldVersatility was underlined by a well-received jazz/blues section andas an encorethe trio played a gentle rendering of Mark Knopfler's Why WorryThe concert was sponsored by Lindsey Clark Brothers of ChurtContributed Off the RecordTHE day of the indie guitar band dominating local music appears to be on the waneif

Lambert's The Rio GrandeOne had heard the ominous rumblings from the singers regarding the complexity of both choral and worksand the language of one of them Hebrewbut in performance on Saturday evening they sounded tremendousJudged by the highest standards there may have some stiffness in the rhythmsome slack articulation of the words and some raucous tone from certain voicesyeturged on by the dynamic playing of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestraand especially by the cohorts of percussionthe singing was exhilaratingThe conductor William Llewellyn may well have had a few sleepless nights but must have been proud of his singersThese were much the best performances I have heard from himand say a lot for the state of HorndeanPetersfield and Rogate Choral Societiesfrom whom the Festival Chorus were drawnThe choice of a counter-tenor for the solos in both works was inspiredandit seemstruly authenticThe music often lies extremely highbut Nicholas Clapton had no difficulty with the tessituraand displayed remarkable breath controlThe pianist was Roger Bluffwho seemed able to draw a singing tone from the Festival piano that I have not heard matched for some timeHe also accompanied three American Folk songs by Coplandwhich were sensitively sungand joined Keir Rowe in the Clarinet concertoMr. Rowe projected his highly contrasted part with the utmost clarity and assurancethough the violins of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra hadunderstandablysome difficulties at the start of the final sectionSamuel Barber's Adagio for Strings was well enough played but lacked the last ounce of passionand suffered badly from the aurally obtrusive air conditioning systemRandall Thompson's Alleluya showed that the Festival Chorus on this occasion were equally as adept at unaccompanied singing as their counterparts had been last weekPerhaps it is too much to hope that this concert finally dragged the Petersfield Musical Festival into the 20th centurybut with a promised appearance by the acclaimed National Youth Jazz Orchestra next yearas well as The Dream of Gerontiusit remains only for the committee to do something about the slow start to the week for the

needs doingthan can be affordedMr. Downham asked the public their views on two subjects currently under discussionOne is the need for a burial groundas the town cemeteryin St. John's churchyardis very nearly fulland there is no possibility of any extensionA new ground will be costly and a suitable area will need to be foundHe asked if residents wanted a new cemetery in Alresfordrather than use the Winchester cemeteryWater fearsThe second subject was that two dry winters are inevitably leading towards a summer of water shortagesThe council are considering asking the Southern Water Authority to impose restrictions on use of water now rather than wait until matters become really seriousMr. Downham also presented the financial accountsaying that it had been decided not to increase the parish council's share from the community chargeby more than five percentReporting for the recreation grounds committeeBarbara Griffiths said that £25,688 had been spent on recreation in Alresford in the past yearThe major projectcosting £20,698had been the refurbishment of the play area at the Stratton Bates recreation groundincluding new equipment and a safety surfaceIt has been agreed that the changing rooms at the Stratton Bates playing field needs to be replaced and £10,000 has already be set aside in the current budget towards the costwhich is anticipated to be in the region of £55,000The Sun Hill recreation ground is in need of similar treatment to that of Stratton BatesA grant has been requested towards the cost of installing a safety surface and a number of residents have volunteered to form a family fund-raising group to help with providing equipmentThis has been welcomed by the councilNew lightsThe shelter and the shed at the War Memorial gardens have been

government guidelineWinchester city councillor Major Dougie Covill requested that more pressure be put upon the county council to improve the footpaths and pavements which are in a very dangerous conditionand a Broad Street businessman wondered if residents were really aware of the changes going on in Broad Streetand the manner in which they were to be undertakenThe meeting ended with a talk with slides presented by Rod Murchie of the National Rivers AuthorityBroad Street changes on showOUTLINES to the proposed changes in Alresford's Broad Street are on display in Eddoll's shop window in

as replacement treespaid for by the town trusteesThe first phase will begin at the Horse and Groom end of the street in the coming financial year and later works will proceed when finance and opportunities permitKey aspects of the scheme will be widening and repaving footwaysreplanting treesretaining car parking and private accesses and improving lightingThe town trustees say they would welcome any comments on the schemeManuscript evening reveals things not generally knownFROM memories of a journey through Alresford in the 1920s to a paper on Rasputinthe stories told by members at

film about RasputinThe case became the standard for setting the difference between libel and slanderEarly memories of Northern Rhodesia were the inspiration for Robin Grieves-Cook's manuscriptHe remembered small birds cleaning teeth of 14ft. crocodiles and a close encounter when he accompanied a hunter and baggedsix crocodilesMotorcycle rideOne of the highlights of the evening was Roy Robins'

Reg Cleaver describe the Jews as an alien peoplein relation to the land of IsraelThe Jewish people have had continuous relationship with the Holy Land for nearly 4,000 yearsSometimes the Jews were independent as in the periods of the Judges and the biblical Kingssometimes a beleaguered subject peopleThey were often an impoverished and persecuted remnantvictims of wave after wave of invaders and persecutors BabyloniansGreeksRomansMoslem ArabsByzantinesCrusaders and Ottomans until the present century brought British troops under General Allenby and the British Mandate in 1917But alienNever thatThere were always Jewish communities in the landAugmented by their co-religionists through the centuriesoften in response to waves of persecution such as the expulsion from Spain which occurred 500 years ago this monthMany great poets and spiritual leaders produced work of benefit to all mankind from the homeland of the Jewish peopleThere are very few countries and groups of people which have had as devoted and heartfelt connection to a land as have the Jews to the land of IsraelI share Mr. Cleaver's sentiment of placing equal value on every human life whether that be JewChristian or Muslemthe world would be a better place if more people did soBut I am troubled that he mentions the deaths of British servicemen without any references to the closing of the gates of Mandatory Palestine to the desperate refugees who tried to leave Nazi Germany but found the rest of Europe and the Jewish homeland closed to themPerhaps Mr. Cleaver has forgotten that the British authorities turned away from Palestine ships laden with hopeless would-be immigrants who were forciblyreturned to Europe and the death campsSome of the ships sank on the way to or from the Promised Landwhile millions perished for want of a safe havenBy virtue of the existence of Israelthe threatened or endangered Russian and Ethiopian Jew can find a homeas did the 800,000 Jews who were expelled from Iraq and other Arab countries when the Jewish State came into beingYet Israel occupies less than a quarter of the mandatory territory controlled by Britain after the first world warIts area is a tiny fraction of that occupied by the 21 hostile Arab statesSyria alone is seven times as largeOne may well blame politicians for much Middle East miseryas Mr. Cleaver maintainsbut without forgetting that Palestine has been partitioned a number of times77 percent of it was cut off in 1922 and called Trans-Jordanthe remaining section was partitioned by the United Nations in 1947This would have given Israel about 10 percent of the original Mandated territoryThe Jewish community accepted the partition planBy contrastthe Arab population and surrounding countries did not accept this United Nations decision and five Arab armies attacked the new State of Israel as soon as it was declared in May 1948Hostility to the Jewish State has been unremitting except in the case of Egypt since 1977In his articleMr. Cleaver omits any mention of successive attacks by Arab armies on Israel since in 1948In the Yom Kippur war of 1973with no declaration of warthe Arab launched a ferocious warthe Arab launched a ferocious war on two fronts on the most sacred day of the Jewish yearMr. Cleaver also omits to mention any of the many infiltrationsbombardments and acts of terror towards a country which has not known a single day of peace in 44 years It is curious that Mr. Cleaver is at pains to accuse Israel of war crimeswhen his previous correspondence in the press has shown a soft spot for Nazi war criminals who may still be living in BritainTo omit this background is rather like accusing the RAF of bombing innocent women and children in Berlin without mentioning that world war two was going on at the timeFor every act of violence quoted by Mr. Cleaverone could cite an Arab attackmassacre or atrocitynot least during the Intifada which has seen well over 500 Palestinians murdered by his fellow PalestiniansBut what good would this doArabs and Israelis inhabit the same part of the world and will continue to do soThe way forward should be for both sides to try and understand one anotherto recognise each others' rightsfeelings and beliefsIf all sides in the conflict make every effort to co-operate in good faith then new life could come to the areaNot only would the desert bloom but the commandment Love Thy Neighbour as Thy Selfwould come to fruitionThat is why the peace processfor which Israel has been striving for 44 yearshas to be seen as the only viable solutionFor Mr. Cleaver to seek to demonise one side while leaving out huge relevant chunks of history is hardly conducive to a proper understanding of the issueslet alone their resolutionRona HartThe Board of Deputies of British JewsWoburn HouseTavistock SquareLondon WC1H 0EZThe conversion of farm buildingsSirThe district council's countryside managerRobin Truscottrecently said that easing planning controls on the conversion of redundant farm buildings would counter the decline of rural communitiesThe wholesale conversion of farm building to expensive housing could seal the fate of a small communityThriving small settlements must have an active and mostly locally based economyThat economy has traditionally depended on the landThe main artery of rural life is being cut by intensive agricultural methods including use of pesticides and fertilisers supplied by large businesseswhile retailing of produce is done by large companies taking a big slice of the profitThe investment in equipment required to thrive in a market devoid of ecological and social concern has led to traditional sustainable farming being squeezed outRealistic energy pricing and policies that safeguard the long-term well-being of the land are neededinstead of short-term narrow market accountingA countryside under intensive farming which depends on leisure and service industries is a cosmeticlifeless

Cowan's DemocracyletterWas it intended to illustrate the inferiority of the Third World illiterates who featured in his anecdote on corrupt voting practicesWere his readers meant to conclude that the corrupt strategy of the Somali policeman was quite acceptable because he thereby produced the correctelection resultOr was the whole episode simply an occasion for our own informed superior merrimentPerhaps Mr. Cowan should resume his more normal incessant political instruction on those matters that puzzle the lesser members of our own contemporary societywho are obviously deemed to lack any ability to think for themselvesL.L. AdamsFlat 22Shaftesbury CourtForest RoadBordonCompulsory votingit's a non-starterSirThere is a small but growing voice to be heard expressing the desire for the introduction of the Australian system of making it compulsory for people to vote in political electionsTo introduce such a law in Britain would be ridiculous and would be another part of our personal freedom taken awayFirstlyunder our present system of confidentiality it is impossible to force someone to voteYou can compel them to go to the polling station and even to put an official election slip into the ballot box but that slip could be blank or spoiledso what would be achievedThe answer isof coursenothingThere will always be a percentage of people who do not vote for various reasonsSome say it is an irresponsible attitude but isn't it more irresponsible to use a vote just because the law commands itIn my opinion it would be better to let sleeping dogs lie as there would be no mileage to be gained from such moveBetter that political parties adopt policies that would encourage people to voteWinston BurrowsCoppice CloseWeybourneWe must share the guilt of animal crueltySirI was sad to read the letter from your correspondent complaining about the hard-hitting anti-fox hunting posterChildren are subjected every day to newspaper and television news bulletins revealing the brutality and ugliness of the world and no matter how hard we try we could never successfully protect our young from the harsh reality of our violent worldShe talks about innocent peoplebeing dragged in and therefore completely misses the point about hunting with houndsIt is legal in Britain to inflict the indefensible cruelty of hounding defenceless animals to death and therefore the terrible stain of this brutality is on all our handsWe have a moral duty to demand that this savagery is outlawed and until we succeed we are all guilty of allowing itLouise Middledorp256 Darnley StreetPollockshieldsGlasgowCanal recreation and ecologyABOUT STRIKING A BALANCESirWhat a peculiar letter from Mr. Holford of Churtabout the Basingstoke CanalFrom his wordingit would appear he has picked up these rumours secondhand from somewhereBut would it not have been sensible to go and see for himselfbefore rushing off a wholly inaccurate letterI live only half a mile from the canaland visit those parts of it nearby regularlyLast August I walked the entire towpath from Greywell to New Hawand can report it is in good condition throughoutis very well used except in the most rural partsand is maintained regularly by the canal authorityThe canal did have an official openinglast Maybut it did not stay open for longShortly afterthe Sheerwater sectionwhich has a history of troublesbegan leakingand the canal below St. Johns had to be closed for the rest of the summerIn August the navigation had to be closed at Ash Lockin order to conserve water in the Hampshire poundIt is well known that this canal always had water shortageseven before modern water extraction diverted part of its natural supply at Greywelland thousands of thirsty trees grew up on its banks on what had been open country in 1790Additional supplies of water are being actively soughtbut the simple truth is that the Basingstoke Canal was never designed for the types and levels of boating some people dream ofLocks have suffered some deteriorationbut this seems to have been mainly a result of idealistic notions of when the canal would be fully operationalSome of the locks were ready long before the canal which serves themand were literally high and dry for a timeLock timber needs to be wetOn the matter of boat trafficMr. Holford seems unaware that the Basingstoke Canal has the dual role of a recreational amenity and a nationally important nature conservation siteSome of the weedsas he calls themare national raritiesThe unique plant community of this canal 94 wetland species recently recordedhigher than any other wetland in Britainmeans that a balance must be struck between the need to conserve rare plantsand the desire by some people to use motor cruisers on itMotor cruisers are the one type of recreational use which is harmful to wetland wildlifeThis is established beyond doubtas a result of years of scientific studyMotorised boats harm the ecology of waterwaysunless use is kept at a low levelwhen there are some benefitsThe problem is to seek the correct balanceand to this end monitoring and studies have been in progress since 1989Some realistic guidelines are beginning to emergebut further work is needed this yearBoat traffic is low in Surrey because much of the canal there has been closedand there have been further restrictions due to water conservationIn Hampshire it is possible that boat traffic is too high at 1991 levelsBoat traffic needs to be kept at modest levels in order to protect one of Britain's most outstanding botanical treasuresChris Hall30 Florence RoadFleetChief Whip's letter on John Browne disgracefulSirIt is hard to imagine that the Chief Whip of the Conservative Party could ever write such a disgraceful letter to the national media March 13thThe vicious tone does him no credit whatsoever and in fact only serves to tarnish the image of the partyIt also confirmsif ever there was a questionthat this serves to illustrate the injustice done to our MemberFurthermoreit is in my viewthat in writing this letterthe Chief Whip seriously abuses the power of his office when he actively tries to influence the electorate in Winchester and AltonI never thought that I would live to

should like to say how much I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Peter Cowan in your paper last weekOutpatient appointments have need sorting out for many yearsIt would be nicetooif patients had an obligation to keep their side of the bargainIn my own practice the equivalent of two complete surgery sessions of people fail to turn up each week without letting us knowThis means that other people have to wait longer than necessary to see a doctorif we could charge non-attendersas dentists doit would helpHoweverimprovements such as this could have been introduced without going wholesale into a market economy for health with its inevitable two-tier system for general practiceThe government claim that GP fund-holding has been a successOf course it hasfor the seven percent of the population covered by the schemeHoweverit has definitely produced an unequal systemwhatever Mr. Waldegraveand Mrs. Bottomley might sayIt would be very difficultif not downright negligentfor such a scheme to fail when it has been overloaded with moneyThe seven percent of the first wave fund-holders was allocated £14.5 million to set up the administrative side of the schemebut the remaining 93 percent were given a total of £19 million in the 1991 autumn statementNon-fundholders have to wait ten weeks in Guildford for an ultra-sound scanfund-holders can have one within two weeksNon-fundholders wait ten months for some outpatient appointmentsfundholders can bring the consultant to the surgery to see the patient within a couple of weeksthis of course helps to get a quicker place on the operation waiting listFund-holders can spend any budget savings on things such as new equipmentextra rooms and extra staffNon-fundholders have to provide these facilities out of their own pocketsThe NHS was supposed to treat all equally but now it has become similar to the difference between first class and tourist class air travelWe would all prefer to be in firstand becoming a fund-holder is a bit like a traveller being given the difference in the fare between the two classesWho would then opt to stay in touristNo wonder GPs are queueing up to joineven though a recent BMA surveyshows that a lot are doing so with misgivingsThe scheme has been a success for fund-holders' own patientsbut detrimental to the restThe advantages that they are getting are admirable and important but reforms that only give these advantages to a select minority cannot be called fairWe all pay the same towards the NHSshould we not get equal benefitsIt will take at least ten years before all general practices can join the fund-holding schemeThis means ten years of persisting inequalityIn this countryquite rightlypeople cannot be discriminated against on grounds of racesexor

ASKEDSirThe following is an open letter to the general election candidatesA lot of people would welcome statements from each of themI have listened in vain to hear anyonein any political partywho has been courageous enough to face up to the crisis in the social servicesThe recessioneducationhealthtaxationetc. are all being hotly debatedbut nobody mentions the problems being experienced by social servicesso vital to disadvantaged peoplethe chronically sick and disabled peopleand the mighty army of the elderlyI therefore challenge candidates of all parties to state clearly and publicly where they stand on the chronic and continuous underfunding of a service which is increasingly being asked to undertake more and more dutiesPompous people are very quick to lay blame on the social services when things go wrongbut why does it happenIt is the Cinderella service because it mainly deals with powerless peoplePlease candidatesdo not deafen us with meaningless statistics about global sums and improvements in real termsthey are political jargon for covering up the truthThose of us on the receiving end know that there is a real financial crisisHow are you going to ensure that Care in the Community is not just a pipe dreamSome of know that it is not working nowand will never work unless some government really faces up to the reality of the cost involvedThose of us in the disabled world are weary of words without actionWe have seen the removal of former care facilitiesOur unofficial carers are tired from unrelieved caringWE have seen the imposition of charges from so called care groups and the imposition of VAT on private care chargesWe have watched the drying up of provision of aids and equipmentThe abolition of the old 75 percent grant system for adaptations to privately owned homes has been replaced by the bureaucratic nightmare on the new system which has dramatically decimated the number of grants made to enable us to live in our own homesWe have seen mass employers getting awards for schemes for employing disabled peoplewhen they operate in premises which are completely inaccessibleThe traditionalmassive unemployment of employable disabled people is far worse than it has ever beenWe still have to travel in guards vans like parcelsand are denied mobility in most forms of transportEvery tiny improvement has to be fiercely fought for in the fields of housingeducation and social pleasureWe still have to wait months for payment of vitally important benefits such as the attendance allowanceThe former chairman of the Independent Appeals Tribunal said to me recently I wonder why it is that no benefit starts from the premises What can we do to helpbut always seems to be How can we stop the bastards getting away with itcoarsebut trueThis listby

week's meeting of Medstead Parish CouncilTony Chivers reported that a number of villagers had volunteered to be footpath representatives and had been allocated two paths eachwhich they had agreed to walk at least twice a yearConcern was again expressed about the proliferation of horses in the countrysideChairman Bob Kimber felt that it was important to try to keep the animals off the roadsperhaps by reclassifying some footpaths as bridlewaysDamage to BOATS Bridleways open to All Trafficby four-wheel drive vehicles and by the unlawful parking of mobile homesalso had an airingMr. Kimber said the parish councils were now recommended to hold a contingency fund within their budget to deal with such problemsThe legal fees involved in removing a caravanfor examplecould be cripplinghe saidNuisance caused by travellers could escalate in Hampshireaccording to the chairmanwith an overspill from Wiltshire who seem to have solved the problem of itinerantsCertainly Medstead appeared to attract its fair shareThere wasreported clerk Bob Parka family living in a caravan parked in a layby on Trinity HallEast Hampshire district and Hampshire County Councils were aware of this familywho were waiting for a house to become availableTrinity HillThe use of the laybyhowevergave concern and councillors suggested looking at the possibility of filling in the laybys along Trinity Hill to prevent further incidents£It was suggested that the caravan dwellers might be hoping for a house on the new Greenstiles developmentbut Medstead housing group chairmanDavid Winterfelt it unlikelyThe Hyde Housing Associationresponsible for the sitehad already drawn up a list of people with strong connections with Medstead basically those who had been resident in the village for over five yearsor former residents who had moved away and wished to returnsaid Mr. WinterIt was hoped that the Greenstiles development would be ready for an official opening in MayInterest was also expressed over another site in the villageadjacent to the schoolwhich East Hampshire District Council were said to be looking at with a view to a second affordable housing developmentMr. Kimber thought thatat this stagethis was merely a feasibility studyThe coming of the wheelie bin was another source of consternationThe feeling of some councillors was that the accompanying contract was somewhat one-sidedThe chairman pointed out that nobody is obliged to accept the contract butif you don'tthey you will have to take your own rubbish to the tip in AltonThe sliding scale for the disposal of large items was also thought to be unreasonableIt is discriminatory against those without carspointed out Mr. Kimberwho supported district council officer Robin Truscott's view that stiff charges could lead to the countryside becoming a litter tipSports councilOn a lighter notethe discussion turned to matters of sportincluding the official opening of the refurbished pavilionto coincide with the Alton Sports Council Cavalcade of

Wheelit will feature clothes supplied by the fashion shop Experienceand starts at 7.30 p.mVerse comes first for laughtermaker LesIT'S seeing the funny side that keeps Les Barker buoyantHis amusing analysis of human frailty has made him one of the folk world's more unlikely heroes a bard who takes the knocks but never shows the bruisingHe was at The Wine GardenAltonon Tuesday night and quickly tickled the chucklebuds with his sharp and sparkling verseLeswhose cultured scruffiness adds pathos to the pzazzis a shrewd operatorHe's appeared at folk festivals all over the land and is in constant demand for club workHe mixes humour with humility and anger with understandingbut never lets indulgence obscure the entertainmentHis homespun philosophy soon found favour at the Wine Gardenone of the newer and most welcome venues on the local folk circuitLes clearly liked the look of the placetook an immediate shine to the audience and launched himself into a neatly structured tirade on what makes tradition tickHis main target was vanityand how materialism has put a brake on the human raceBut Leswho was preceded in the Alton spotlight by Odiham duo Acoustic Bikiniis more than just a humorist Top singersHe's a gifted songwriter whose tunes have been taken up by some of the country's top folk singersHis adaptation of Oh Dear Oh is regularly featured on June Tabor's repertoire and Mike HardingBob Williamson and Vin Garbutt have been known to tip into the Barker songbagFairport Convention have performed the eccentrically entertaining Quasi B. Goodeand Richard Digance and Fiona Simpson are among numerous other singers who've experimented with his workBut at The Wine Gardenthe menu featured verse and monologuesand the impish Les sauntered through the trials and tribulations of 20th century indiscretion in a mockingly disapproving mannerThe audience approved thoughand fired by their enthusiasmhe loosened the reins and charged cheerfully into the murky world of speedgreed and what the nation readsKnife throwerNot enoughit seemsindulge in the works of this mercurial Mancunian whose act is difficult to pigeonholebut easy to enjoyHe's written over 30 booksrecorded five albums and won friends wherever he's appearedNot bad for an ex-accountantwhose role as a professional idiotbegan back in 1975Perhaps his most inspired piece is the saga of Cosmothe fairly accurate knife throwerwhose failure to see the point makes him the sharpest act in townAnd this from a man whose more serious moments have spawned a folk opera about the island of Lewis and tuneful contributions to charity cassettesFor a genre that often takes itself too seriouslyit's reassuring to know that Les's jokes remain his greatest joyHe certainly gave the Alton aficionados lots to laugh aboutLes BarkerThe next folk night at The Wine Garden is on April 14thwhen Derek Brimstone will be in the spotlightCHURCH SERVICESFriday FocusPrayers and the electionDURING the furore of the next three weeks of General Election campaigningfor Christians perhaps a few reflections about the institution which is the House of Commons and especially about the men and women who are sent there would not come amissA thought first for those who have decided to retiremany after a quarter of a century or more as membersWhether or not they expected it when they were first electednearly all of them will have learned to accept ant to derive fulfilment from the welfarefunctionRelief there will be from the grind of the daily pile of constituency correspondence and the regular weekend surgeriesFor mostthe tedium of weekly travelthe long sitting hours and the heartache of separation from normal family life may soon begin to fade from the memoryButfor certainthe fellowship of the placethe friendships many of them cross-party will be things they will long miss and never forgetWe should give thanks for their work and pray for themNext a thought for those who will lose their seatsThat they are an essential part of any system of parliamentary democracy will be of limited consolation to themMost will hope to return to the Houseand on part form many will do sobut the immediate problems of adjustment will be hardTheytoowill deserve our prayersThe greatest number will be those returning for their secondthirdfourth or later termsFor some promotion will engender a proper sense of pride and excitementbut a sense of humility and service will equally be called forFor others there may be a lack of preferment and other problems of staleness and complacencyThere are endless variationBut this group are the bedrock of the institution and as such should figure prominently in our prayersFinallythere will be the new MembersMost will privately confess to an initial sense of utter bewildermentbut necessity will drive them to adapt to their new way of lifeAlmost before they realise itthey may even find themselves defending some of the more absurd parliamentary conventionsTheir families will also find life very different and testingIn some ways this group may be in most need of our prayersbut the sense of freshness and opportunity pervadesAll these thoughts seem right and proper at this time butwhen all is said and donemight not much of the above be applied to any institutionThe House of Commons may be the cradle of our democracy a little better understood perhaps now that its proceedings are televisedButhowever specialit is first and foremost a workplace in just the same way as a factorya hospitalor schoolIn commending it to Godwe should couple it with all the workplaces in our landA member of the congregationSt. John the EvangelistChurtWhen a person goes up in smokeTHE DOCTORI STARTED smoking 40 cigarettes every daybut I don't finish 40I find them deadin the ashtray or unlit between my fingersI just forget about themWhat a waste of moneyThis was Mr. Spiers speaking in my surgeryI wondered if this happened to many other smokersDoes it happen to youAs an experienced 40-a-day man for 40 yearshe was very interesting to talk toHe had tried to give up and was going over the problems he'd come across and continuedYou need something to do with your hands hold a pencil in one hand and a rubber in the other or grasp the car steering wheel with both and keep them thereWhen hands are fully occupiedsmoking is more difficultResist the temptation to light upespecially in the morningshe addedI reckon that if I didn't have that cigarette first thing in the morningI could last out and resist the rest of the dayThat's the crucial oneSowe discussed how to avoid that first one in the morningFinish the last packet of cigarettes the night before and not dash out to the off-license or garage before going to bed in order to stock upI hadn't bargained for the next difficultyIt won't workhe commentedbecause my son smokes and he'll take pity on me and give me one when I run outWhy not try to stop with a friend and add an element of competition to the taskPerhaps a small bet on who can stop firstBetter stillstop with your son and you won't be able to feed each other fags in a crisisI suggestedAs soon as you wake up pop a piece of nicotine chewing gum into your mouth and chew it slowly whilst you are getting dressed and shavingThat will give you a boost of the drug to start the day without the nastiesNicotine is incredibly addictive at least as powerful as cocaine or heroinHoweverit won't kill you unless you inject it into yourself and then it is more lethal than those other drugsJean Nicotthe French ambassador to Portugal who sent tobacco seeds back to the French court in 1560has a lot to answer forNicotine gums are safer than smokingThe real damage comes from the nasties tarschemicals and the irritant effects of the smoke itself which causes lung and heart diseaseNicotine chewing gum can now be bought over the counter at the chemistsMr. Spiers hadn't realised thatChewing and sucking are comforting for the human being and the roots of this go right back into babyhoodHence the comfort from eatingsucking sweets or a pipeand drawing on a cigaretteNicotine chewing gum helps in more than one wayI explainedHe thought these were helpful plans something positive to get to grips with the habit and see an end to cash shortages in the housekeeping as money was siphoned off for another packetno more sandpaper taste in the mouthno clothes reeking of stale tobacco and an end to the shakesHe didn't like the tremors that went with the addiction the wavering match as he lit up again and spilling his tea during a work-break was embarrassingI'll start nowhe vowedsuddenly making up his mindTonightI reminded himafter that last packetBut no moreIf you've none in the house you can't smoke themNo time like the present and anyway it is the first day of LentHe grinnedI don't think he thought of thatI'll keep you posted on his progress and the best of luck to you as you give upGoing crazy for cashTELEVISION South are determined to make this year's Telethon the best everdespite the disappointment of losing its franchiseAnd they're looking for your

asked why the parish council were so against the signs Do the parish have an official policybecause if they dothey should think again about the effect it has on the villageThe area most recently affected by such planning decisions is The Squarea conservation area in the centre of LiphookThree shops Circle Kthe Bombay Restaurant and Border Insurance display externally lit fascias and met with parish council objectionsMr. Coyte felt this was wronghe saidWithout shop lighting the village becomes dull and uninterestingWhile it must be said the illumination does advertise the shop it greatly brightens the area with its window displaysIn some cases the street lighting is poor and such shops signs give much needed additional light at no cost to the chargepayerUsing Circle K as an example he complained that since the lighting had been removed the corner was dulldark and dangerous and not a place to walk late at nightDavid Clark thought there might be some need for review while Adrian Bird felt that a blanket prohibition should only be a starting point which should be used in conjunction with local knowledgeMichael Croucher thought it would be better to wait until the question of the

Shepherd at Four Marks have announced far reaching plans to extend pastoral care further into the parishAt the annual meetingsome 70 people heard of the parish Outreach scheme and of plans to extend the building itself to provide a much larger Christian centreSpeaking after the meetingthe Rev. Colin Noyce told the Alton Herald that since arriving in the parish some 16 months agohe has realised the need for an extension of pastoral caretogether with extra room at the churchThe two go in tandemsaid the vicarwho would like to see a living building as part of a living churchThe needon one levelis for extra spaceparticularly for the Children's Church which is growing like madAt present the parochial church council are awaiting the result of a planning application to install a Portakabinwhich would provide a temporary home for the youngstersas well as creche facilitiesWhat is needed in the long term is a larger worship area which can be adapted for other usesThe vicar and his teamled by outgoing churchwarden Robert Parkerenvisage an extension which would double the width of the existing churchand which would include a parish office and a private room for counselling and other meetingsA lot of moneyButsaid Mr. Noycethese plans are still very much in embryo formWe still have to get permission from the deanery synod and the dioceseand plans have to be drawn upWe are looking two to three years ahead at leastAnd it will require a lot of moneyAny future extension would dovetail with the present scheme to extend pastoral care into the communityA lot of work is already being done by the village care group and good neighboursbut Mr. Noyce feels the need to emphasise this work with the help of committed ChristiansAn Outreach scheme has been devised which divides the parish into six areaseach manned by teams of church members whose job it is to identify ways in which they can provide help and report back to the churchMr. Noyce firmly believes that the work of Outreach is even more important than providing the improved facilities at the church itselfI believe that the church exists for the communityhe saidand not just for itselfOther business at the annual church meeting included the election of Andrew Hunt and Tim Griffiths as churchwardensBetty and Bill

the footpath plansANCIENT TRACK CHANGESA LOCAL historian has called plans to change the name of an ancient public footpath at the end of a leafy lane of substantial and secluded homes in Haslemere as nothing short of environmental and archaeological vandalismProposals to re-classify the ancient track crossing National Trust commonland as a byway open to all traffichas brought growing fears that Farnham Lane could eventually become a link to the new A3 Hindhead bypassResidents have expressed fears about the move by Surrey County Council after a notice appeared on a wooden pole at the top of Farnham Lane with a map showing the changes affecting three rights of way in Haslemere and one in ChiddingfoldRoman timesA favourite spot for horse-ridersramblers and walkersthe right of way which runs in a straight line from a point close to the Royal Naval School comes out at the Hindhead gibbetThe plans have already led to a number of Farnham Lane residents and others interested in protecting the track which is believed to pre-date Roman times to object to the reclassification schemeAn anonymous notice has also been placed beneath the original at the beginning of the right of way urging people to oppose any plans to re-classify the trackand alerting them to possible future proposalsSecretary of Hindhead preservation GroupChris Woodwardwho is an amateur historian and has been an active campaigner for the area for the past five yearssaid he was totally opposed to the changeDescribing the track as one of the most ancient and well preserved sunken trackways in the south of England that could well pre-date Roman timeshe said he was concerned about its possible destructionTraffic plansAlthough difficult to date he believes the trackway to have been in existence for at least 2,000 years and may well pre-date Roman timesThere was alsohe saidalready enough vehicular access points on to the common without more being introducedhe saidMr. Woodward said that there was a substantial and clearly defined trackway used by local traffic presently running parallel to the east of the track joining others to the west and north of the parish boundaryThe re-classification of this public path to that of a byway open to all traffic is unnecessarysaid Mr. WoodwardA Farnham Lane resident who did not wish to be named said that he was strongly opposed to any footpath being opened up to trafficIf the Yellow Route is finally adopted for the A3 Hindhead bypass it could be the first step to bringing a lot of traffic and development to Farnham Lanehe saidOnce the terminology for the right of way is changedthe authorities may well find it a lot easier to change their minds about the sort of traffic it carriessaid another residentDispel fearsSurrey County Council's assistant county director for highways and transportPaul Higertysaid he was able to dispel any fears that residents may have over the reclassification schemeIt washe saidsolely a legal exercise and wouldn't physically change the rights of wayIt is something required by the highway authority and is purely a legal classificationhe saidand it is extremely unlikely that any roads used as public paths would ever be considered as anything else than they are nowsaid Mr. HigertyCome into the gardenNATIONAL Trust houses and gardens open their gates for a new season of visitingstarting on

distance every time with a few minor running repairs sometimesIt is quite a rare model and only three or four others exist in this country and one or two in AustraliaThis model was only made in 1913 and 1914This year's run was rather windyhe said and quite a few people did have problemsThere were also some roadworks along the route and we did not pass our usual stopping place for a cup of tea so we pressed straight on to BrightonThe run has been held every year since 1930apart from the war years and is the main event in the veteran calendarAll machines have to meet stringent dating requirements and the organisers only accept pre-1915 veteransEntries come from all over the country to take part in the run from Epsom Downs to Brighton and there were also several entries from the

another cup finalFARNHAM TN. 2CRANLEIGH 1Farnham reached their second cup final of the season and they did it the hard way when they met Cranleigh in the semi-finals of the Class Elite Cup at the Memorial Ground on SaturdayTown might have been expected to dispose of a side they have already beaten twice this seasonbut not necessarily with ten men for 68 minutes of the gameThey seemed well in control after 20 minuteshaving taken an early lead and looked a class better than their mid-table opponentsBut Peter Browning's dismissal after 22 minutes changed all that and Cranleighhaving drawn level by half-timelooked a good bet to record a shock victory over the Dan Air leadersHoweverFarnham showed their true mettle in the second half with a gritty performance allied to Ernie Howe's shrewd redeployment of his playersHe withdrew striker Steve Flanagan and brought on young Sean Dowling at right-backFarnham were thus able to rely on a strong midfield presence of MillardDaly and Maywith Deighan and Stairs looking to stretch Cranleigh wide on the flanksDowlingin factshowed great composure under pressure and Farnham were able to regain the defensive security that Cranleigh chiefly through the pace of Roger Carpenter had undermined in the first halfEarlierthings had looked black for the visitors as Farnham moved into the lead after just 14 minutesShaun May had already brought a diving save from 'keeper Jukes with a hard ground shot and the midfielder was also involved with the goalAfter combining with Gary Millard at a short cornerMay lifted a high cross over a crowded goalmouth and Steve Harris stormed in on the far post to hit a great first-time shot into the opposite cornerThe determined Cranleigh side were far from downhearted and they almost got a quick equaliser when Chris Lambollhaving beaten 'keeper Paul Cannsaw his shot booted off the line by Steve BuckinghamIt was quite out of character when Browninghaving tangled with Edwardsaimed a kickapparently in retaliation at the Cranleigh player right in front of the referee John FordAfter receiving treatment for himselfBrowning was sent offMillard dropped to left-backwith Buckingham switching to the rightbut Farnham's rhythm was disrupted and Cranleigh were quick to take advantageOn 30 minutesFarnham's defence was all over the place at a free-kick and the ball fell at a perfect height to an unmarked Lamboll who struck an unstoppable volley past CannCarpenter's speed and control was even causing problems for Harrishimself no slouchand Farnham's hearts must have been in their mouths when the Cranleigh number 10having broken clear on the righthit the deck after a late challenge by Cann who had raced out of his areaHoweverreferee Ford judged it to be a yellow card offence and the free-kick came to nothingAfter a narrow escape straight from the start of the second halfwhen Carpenter screwed the ball wide from a good positionFarnham's re-organised side played with growing authorityThe strong cross-wind was now more in Town's favour and they managed to keep play in Cranleigh's half for long periodsIt was not pretty to watchwith the ball often being held up and played back to Cannbut it was effectiveand Farnham were ready to strike when their own chance came alongA free-kick some 30 yards out gave them their opportunity with 12 minutes remainingJukes could only parry May's blockbuster at the foot of the post and the alert Deighan squared the ball back in for Steve Stairs to force it over the lineCranleigh manager Roy Kelsey made a double substitution as Cranleigh battled to force extra time and they were almost rewarded in the final minuteswith Cann charging the ball down before the ever-dangerous Carpenter could place his

to implement community care was distributed to customerscarersstaff from other agenciesunion representatives and county council members at the beginning of the yearThe county council's Social Services committee endorsed the paper's key objectives at their meeting last weekThese aims need to be put into practise over the next year so that the department can meet their new responsibilities under the NHS and Community Care ActFrom April 1993social services will be responsible for assessing the needs of peoplewho may require residential or nursing home careThis care will be paid for using funds transferred from the Department of Social SecurityThe proposed plan of action focuses on the way health and social services work together to provide services to those in needparticularly elderly peopleincludingThe development of contract arrangements with the private and voluntary sector to ensure consumers have maximum choice in deciding which service most suits their needsfor example residential and day careEnsuring consumers and carers are involved with the statutory agencies in the planning of future servicesAssistant director of social servicesAndrew BrookersaidWe have consulted with a wide range of staff and other agencies who have a direct interest in how Hampshire carry out implementation of community care legislationWe are gratified to see that our approach is endorsedMuch work remains to be donebut we have achieved the first stage in gaining agreement to our approach in ensuring Hampshire's future servicesAppeal lodgedTHE owner of Valley Nurseries of Basingstoke RoadAltonhas appealed to the Secretary of State for the Environment against an enforcement order issued by East Hampshire District Council on January 17thintended to stop them selling items other than agricultural produce from their farm shopThe appeal suggests that activities taking place there do not constitute a breach of planning permission but thatif it is considered that they dopermission ought to be grantedThe district council claim that unauthorised use of the farm shop for the sale of goods not produced within the farm holding is not a use ancillary to agricultural useand is contrary to policies laid down by the district local planThe use has led to further commercialism of the land and has been to the detriment of the rural character of the areathey sayFurthermoreinadequate visibility from the access to the main road makes it dangerous for trafficThe appeal will be decided by written submissionsAnyone who would like to make recommendations can do

will be awarded to members as they reach their 50th year of membershipIn addition they will receive a personal letter of thanks and congratulations from the chairman of the RACJeffrey Roseand 60-year members will be given honorary membership of the company's top-range UK service reflexCommented RAC Rescue Services head of marketingAndy BrownIt is quite amazing to think that many of the longest surviving members have belonged to the RAC for more than two-thirds of its 95-year historyAmong the RAC's five million members are approximately 3,000 motorists who will qualify for the new long service awardsDIGNITY AND DECENCYTelevision drops ban on funeral advertisementsTELEVISION viewers in the south may soon be seeing advertisements for undertakersas funeral directors gear up for an increasingly competitive and high-profile marketThe Independent Television Commission have now removed the ban on funeral directorsBut Mary Vincenta director of Funeral Services Petersfieldsaid she was appalled at the idea of television advertisingIt is a very personal thingshe saidIt is not like buying a three-piece suiteYou can hardly put into advertising something that is very personal to each familyBut she welcomed publicity for pre-payment plans which could help to put families minds at restHer company operates the NAFD schemewhich involves a lump sum being paid into a trust in advanceA spokesman for Alton undertakersCharles Read & Daughtersaid they were not over keenon television advertising and did not foresee smallindependent firms such as theirs using itThe proprietor of Bordon undertakers Thorne-LeggattDavid Leggattwas unconvinced and agreed that the independent sector would probably not partake in itHe said that while it was difficult to give exact pricesan average funeral cost £932Asked whetherin this increasingly environment-conscious world it made sense to use expensive oak or metal casketsMiss Vincent saidYou cannot dictate to families what they can haveTheir wish is paramountShe added that the number of people who opted for cremation was increasing although there was still a section of society to whom cremation was unthinkableMr. Leggatt said that 75 percent of funerals locally were cremations higher than the national average and he speculated that this may be because of the lack of cemeteries in the areaFour years ago a new cemetery was opened in Whitehill after the churchyards at Blackmoor and Headley became fullBut Mr. Leggatt hoped that the lack of space for burials would not lead to restrictions in the futureI would like to think that it will not be something that will be legislatedHopefully there will always be a choicehe saidThe Charles Read spokesman agreed that there had been an increase in the number of cremationsbut was unable to determine the reason for the trendHe said some people who found it difficult to pay for relatives' funerals due to redundancy or mortgage payments were offered payment by monthly instalments while others who would not or could not pay were pursued to the small claims courtYou do not know whether somebody is trying it onhe saidbut one will be guided by one's own solicitorMiss Vincent suggested people on a budget should contact members of the National Association of Funeral Directors NAFDbecause they worked to a code of practiceThe recession must have affected people but you can get assistance from the DSS Department of Social Securitywho are very helpfulMr. Leggatt said the recession had affected the industry to a minimal degreeWhen it comes to the last rites people will have what they best feel suits the deceasedAlan Mitchell's NATURE NOTES for MarchAFTER a slowgrudging and hesitant startspring had suddenly sprung on March 16thThe sparsely flower speckled crowns of Pissard plums became clouds of densely heldbunched white and the later opening rather harsh pink flowers of the form Nigra emerged fullyThe lovely Accolade treeshaving waited two weeks with deep rose-red buds and a few open flowersburst into copious rows of sumptuous semi-double flowers of pure icing-sugar pinkThe related hybrid Pandora opened many of its pink buds into white flowers like a latersuperior form of Pissards' on a neat crownThe almonds moved into top gearas did the sallowsthe male trees now great bushes of bright goldand a sycamore by the main road between Birdworld and Forest Lodge at Holt Pound has spread its leavesAll this has happened in the absence of any balmy warm spelljust a few days without cold nights and with midday temperatures hardly as high as 50FIt could be imagined that the trees had saidBlow this for springIt never seems to arrive properlyWe have waited too longLet's goIt ison the wholemore likely that they are responding to the cumulative temperature building up slowly until a threshold has been passedand they are awayThe danger of our treacherous spring unleashing a killing frosthas receded to some extentand although recent Aprils have done much damagethe early flowers are over by then and the bad spells areevery daylikely to be shorterBlackbirds and starlingsWhere until two years agothe scattering of currants near the door was eagerly awaited by a clamouring mix of blackbirdsstarlingrobins and a songthrush or twolately there has been almost an indifference to the largesseThe birds are still aroundbut remain largely aloof in the bushesPerhaps they really prefer more natural food and this has been plentifulbut that it not obviously soThe crumb-spreading area of the lawn still attracts its full quota and the statutory trio of dunnocks is perennially on view and a pair of jays are often hopping aroundFor a week or so in Februarya pair of longtailed tits was often to be seen in and beneath the shrubs near the nutbagThis was odd as it indicated that the winter flock had already scattered as separate pairs at this very early dateTheir feedinghoweverwas more strange still and out of characterWhen the birds were not foraging with greenfincheschaffinches and robins on the fragments beneath the bagsthey were feeding on the nuts in the bag like other tits doand this is seldom seenThe great spotted woodpecker began brief but intense bursts of drumming in the second week of January which is a week or so earlier than in most recent years and many weeks earlier than was normal a decade agoTodayon March 18ththe lesser spotted woodpecker had a spell of drummingIt was interesting to note a complete change in the timbre and resonance when the bird moved to another song-perchThis could have been an argument for the theory of the mechanical origin of the sound in the days when some still insisted that it was vocalNot conclusiveof coursebut an indicationToday no such evidence is needed as the matter was settled in favour of the mechanical explanationalthough it is hard to envisage any human attempt to produce the resonant sound from a branch with any contraption without a strong amplifierMarch 17th is my traditional early chiffchaff date and although a journey south to Poole and a short time near possible sites on that dayyielded no hearing of the birdone has been singing in this garden todaySnow-white flowersThe roadsides yesterday from Farnham to Winchester were spectacular over large stretches by HolybourneAltonand towards the Winchester bypassand in many places betweenwith great drifts of snow-white flowers of Myrobalan plumIt will inevitably by called blackthornwhich should not be in flower for a monthbringing its winterwith itand growing on short-jointed tangles of stems rather than on the slender longer shoots of these bushy treesI do wonder if some of these are in fact the wild plum rather than Myrobalanand I marvel that in summer we hardly notice any plum-like shrubs where we now see them so dominant over long stretches of banksIt may also be noted that last year the true blackthorn overlapped the Myrobalan in flowering seasonOur robin with the white flashes in its wings has ceded the prime territory nearest the house to another and is now with its matecentred on the next bed along and ventures only occasionally into the crumb-patchfrom which it is firmly evictedNot being voyeurswe have not observed the intimate occasions from which the sex of this bird can be determinedRecognising the unsafe youngmale driverA PIONEERING study into why so many young men are unsafe drivers suggest that driver training should focus on attitudes and relationships as well as mechanicsThe study was undertaken for the AA Foundation for Road Safety Research by the department of Psychology and the transportation Research Group at the University of SouthamptonIts findings challenge traditional thinking about road safety educationsuggesting that pre-licence training should include social influences on drivingthe impact of parentpeer and passenger behaviourdrinkingmusic and moodOver confidentA significant minority of men aged 17–24 take risks when they drive because they feel confident in their ability behind the wheelThey must be made to realise that driving skills alone will not prevent accidentssays the AA reportSome young men believe that they are safe drivers even when they are notthe research findsAs a resultroad safety campaigns have little effect on them because they are seen as being directed at unsafedriversSuccessful road safety campaignssays the reportare likely to be those that encourage responsible and considerate driving to be the normToo many young peopleparticularly young menseek to earn the respect of their peers through risky drivingThe AA Foundation study also suggests that car radio/cassette players should be designed to be as automatic as possibleand sold with an information leaflet highlighting the possible influences of music on drivingYoung men generally find drink-driving unacceptableaccording to the researchIf they do drive over the legal limitit is usually because they are left with no other way to get home and they worry about parental reaction if they are late getting homeThe researchAn earlier study undertaken for the AA Foundation by Southampton University compared the driving performanceattitudes and behaviour of 439 drivers between the ages of 17 and 40The report of that research Accident risk and behavioural patterns of younger drivers published last year showed that more than a third of the men aged 17 to 25 were assessed as unsafedriversand suggested that this had more to do with lifestyle than with driving skillsFor the new studya researcher from the university's department of psychology conducted interviews with 56 young men who the earlier research had assessed as either safe or unsafe driversEach was questioned on driving behaviourexperienceattitude to other driversthe influence of others and leisure activitiesThe use of in-depth qualitative methods is relatively untried in driver researchbut here is shown to be most valuableLaughed atGenerallydrink-driving was frowned on by both the safeand unsafedriversit often happened only when there was no other way to get homeBeing let down by friends or a lack of public transport not only encouraged drink-drivingit also led young people to accept lifts from friends who had been drinkingA couple of boys used to make a thing about getting pretty drunk and then going outsaid one of the intervieweesIt was laughed atbut secretly we'd say Oh Godthey're being stupidBut the same stigma was not associated with accident involvement or dangerous drivingUnsafe driversin particularaccepted that every male driver would at some time do something riskyA crash or a motoring conviction was viewed as unluckyrather than something that should have been avoidedA 19-year-old commentedPeople buy a wreck and don't mind wrecking itFunnily enoughnone of them would drink and drive or not wear a seatbeltA small number said that pressure of work made them take risksOne driver told the interviewerI'm always thinking that they're sat back in the office thinking Where has he got toand it puts you on edge so I always drive faster in a company car because time is against meThe unsafedriver is more likely than the safedriver to be a non-manual worker and to have stayed on at school after the age of 16Others said that their driving was risky because friends andto a lesser extent the publicpolice and insurance companies labelled him as high riskand charged him a high premiumhe might as well get his money's worthPassenger's influenceNinety percent of the drivers reported that passengers had an influence on their drivingParentsadults and girlfriends as passengers encouraged safer or slower drivingBut some drivers who were assessed to be unsafe admitted that their peers encouraged them to drive fastDrivers of both groups said that drunken passengers were a problemthey messed aboutin the cargrabbed the steering wheel and pulled on the handbrakeWhile media seemed to have little influence on driving behaviourboth groups of drivers felt that it showed cars in an unrealistic light only seven percent thought otherwiseAs one driver put itIt's ridiculousIt makes people think they're invinciblethey can put a seatbelt on and they'll be all rightYou see a car roll over in a film and people get up and walk awaypeople I know have rolled cars and broken arms and legsA profile of the unsafe driver can be made from the findingsHe is interested in high risk thrill-seeking sports such as hang-gliding or motorcyclingWhen he goes out in the evening he is invariably with his mates whose influence may encourage him to take risksHe may well be a skilled driver with quick reactionsbut he will deliberately take risksHe loves drivingrather than seeing his car as a way of getting him from A to Band sees his car as a status symboland means to power and freedomHe also enjoys working on his car and talking about cars with his friendsAffected by moodsHis mood can affect his driving If I'm depressedI drive quite gentlyIf I'm pissed offI drive like a lunaticA bad mood can be brought on by what he sees as stupidbehaviour by other motoristsClearlyonly a minority of young men are dangerous driversbut of thosetoo many are influenced by their peers to drive dangerouslysaid Kenneth Faircloththe AA's deputy director generalThis situation must be changed if we are to reduce their involvement in road accidentsThe success of drink drive campaigns hinges on urging society as a whole to reject this behaviour and they have been particularly successful among younger driversthe same tactics should be employed to target unsafe drivingProject boosts historyHAMPSHIRE County Council planners are awaiting the results of a major archaeological research project which should provide valuable new information on sitesdating back to the Stone Agelocated in gravel deposits throughout the areaThe Southern Rivers Projectwhich began last year and is funded by English Heritageis
