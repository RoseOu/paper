wronggetting richer and lovelier by the hourThis led her into masterpieces like Gilda and The Lady from Shanghaiplus a fistful of failed marriagesMs Leaming tells it all with vimthough the gossip

forgetAnd God forgiveand Willy pardonWillythus bracketed with the Almightywas of course her husbandWehowevermay think that Hetty's wicked wit was the best thing about herThis fascinating story is one of many such in Roger Lonsdale's anthology of Eighteenth-Century Women Poetsnot just a marvellous piece of scholarship but as richly entertaining and original a book as I have come across for some timeOut of the dust of the BodleianDr Lonsdale has resurrected more than a hundred witty women and set them glistening and pulsing with life and spirits before usand through their fresh and often subversive eyesthe Augustan age seems much closer than it didHow many women poets of the eighteenth century can most of us nameI was stuck after AnneCountess of WinchilseaLady Mary Wortley MontaguJoanna BaillieMrs Barbauld and Helen Maria WilliamsLonsdale's ladies are by no means all aristocrats or the daughters of schoolmasters and clergymenthey include washerwomenmilkwomen and servant girlsthe disreputable and the priggishthe contented spinster and the erring Duchessloving wivesbluestockingsgovernessesactresses and invalids are all representedTheir biographies contain material for a dozen booksThe number of women poets swelled through the centurynot least because they learnt they could speak to one another in this wayThe discontents and aspirations of each individual woman found an answering voicejoined togetherthey became a chorus of inspiration for feminismThey were helped by provincial publishers who saw money in the subscription system and the growing market of women readersSome were encouraged by Richardsonand by Dr Johnsona fervent believer in the abilities of womenMany of the poems naturally have feminist themes complaints about lack of formal educationdomestic duties and brutish husbandsWife and servant are the same But only differ in the nameOne bold womanMiss W-takes on SwiftHer answer to the Dean's famous poem on Celia's dressing room is not recommended to readers of a nervous disposition edin parts it is more disgusting than the originalIt is also devastatingOf course the poetry's no goodgrumbled a friend to whom I was praising this volumeHe has not read it yetbut in any case he is wrongThere may be no single poem in it to equal Pope's Eloisa to Abelard 1717Gray's Elegy 1751or Coleridge's Frost at Midnight 1798but one of Lonsdale's intentions is to encourage us to extend our definition of what constitutes poetryAs in his earlier anthologyThe New Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse 1984he sets out to question some of the deeply ingrained preconceptions about what it was possible to feelthinkand write in the eighteenth centuryThe most striking vein he mines is that of conversational and epistolatory poemsthey run through the centuryoffering character sketchesrural and city scenesdrawing-room and marital exchangesOne of the finestby one of the finest poetsthe Cumbrian Susanna Blamireis WeyNedManrecording a

Winchilsea's address To Spleenand Henrietta O'Neill's Ode to the Poppywith its almost Keatsian languorLonsdale finds thatas the century progressedincreasing refinement of taste led to a loss of the informalityhumour and immediacy that he prizes mostand it was precisely the strained and highflown verse that was eclipsed by the success of Lyrical BalladsLadiesverse' became a phrase of

FamiliarAlice WalkerThe Women's Press12.95 poundsBy JILL NEVILLEA ROMANCE of the last 500,000 yearsis how Alice Walker describes her latest novelIt is tricked out with a handsome jacket and contains the standard acknowledgementsincluding the author's thanks to the Universe for her participation in ExistenceFatal signs of weakness in American women's fictionthese earnest references to cheerful supportgracefulness and skillsensitive criticismand inspiring exampleare no doubt useful as emotional blackmail to inveigle the reader into the moist sisterhood of approvalAlasthis book need all the blackmail it can getfor it cannot stand up by itself to disinterested scrutinyAlmost everything is wrong with itin particular the tonewhich is enormously soppyhard to credit from the author of The Color PurpleMost modern black writing read largely by white readersconstitutes a Literature of Blameand it is certainly our turn to bow the neck and bear the blowsOnce more we have the horrors of the slave-tradethe vicious overseerthe destroyed African communitiesthe black women endlessly rapedtheir backbones scraping along the groundtheir smothered screamsButwith its lack of paradoxits sonorous and sentimental proseThe Temple of My Familiar reads like one enormous gospel-chant of reassurance for blacksdevoid somehow of truthIn fact it something called the Gospel According to Shugwhich is meant to be taken seriouslyHELPED are those who love the lesbianthe gay and the straightas they love the sunthe moon and the starsNone of their childrennor any of their ancestorsnor any parts of themselvesshall be hidden from themWalker retells the history of the world from the black perspective with a series of symbolic vignettesThese firesidemonologues emerge from an assortment of inter-related characters and jump back through time to poor white AdamNature's mistakeOld Miss Lissie not only remembers her previous livesbut changes physically when she does soHence photographs of herself taken by a lover look like lots of different womenReaders who believe in reincarnation will probably not find all this such tough goingSometimes the discussion of rebirth sounds like Shirley Maclean's writings on channellingthough one suspects it is not meant toBut it would also be helpful to believe in some paradisal previous age of matriarchy and goddess-worshipto believe in astrology and to believe in the rightneousness of each feminist reflexThere is one scene in which the straight-guy Suwelo refuses to push a cart to the shopshe would rather go by carpushing a cart makes him feel un-mannedHis wife Fanny is appalled by this unreconstructed maleness which is called a little murderFanny is mystical and tends to go away on her ownso Suwelo has an affair with Carlottawho wears three-inch heelsCarlotta is just comforting herselfHer husbandthe all-wise singer Arveyda named after a bar of soaphas run off with his mother-in-law a terrific storythisand well-toldBut they all end up happily together in orgasmic reconciliationIn contrast to the melodramatic historical memoirs there is a poignant moment when Suwelo faces the memory of his parentswho were killed in a car accidentOften the wonderful natural natural story-teller in Walker breaks through the marshmallow and has us on the edge of the chairbut finally and lamentably this is a failureIt would be insulting to someone of Walker's stature to pretend otherwiseBOOK REVIEW Tales of true suffering in EritreaTowards AsmaraThomas KeneallyHodder & Stoughton12.95 poundsBy JEREMY BROOKSWE HAVE become used to seeing Thomas Keneally centre his novels on well-researched historical eventsfrom the charge of Joan of Arc in the extraordinary Blood RedSister Rose of 1974through the convict settlement of Australiathe American civil war and the negotiations that ended World War I to his Booker Prize-winnerSchindler's Arkset in Poland at the height of the holocaustan unforgettable and moving bookIn his new novelTowards AsmaraKeneally is writing about the presentormore accuratelyabout a historical event that is not yet overEritrea's struggle for its independence from Ethiopia has gone onfirst against Haile Selassie and then against the Soviet-backed Mengistu regimesince 1952when the UN feebly handed over control of its Trust Territory to Addis AbabaThe suffering and the slaughter have been almost unbelievableIt is a largely forgotten war in whichas Soviet enthusiasm has wanedand Mengistu has been deposedthe Eritreans have increasingly gained the upper handAs I write there are a few smallunexcited newspaper reports about the progress of peace talks taking placeunder the aegis of ex-President Jimmy Carterin AtlantaGeorgiaThe Eritreans are describedas usualas the rebelsIt is not possible to review this novel without such a background sketchhowever flimsyThe narrator of the bookDarcya lawyer-turned-journalist in flight from a failed marriageis inspired by a thinly-disguised Bob Geldof figure to question his ignorance about these mattersHe makes contacts with Eritrean representatives in Londonand then the professional lure of a scoop brings himbumpilyto the front line in the mountainswith Asmarathe capitalonly a 100 miles awayKeneally himselfresearching the booktrod this same hazardous path in 1987and one may suppose that much of what Darcy describesKeneally sawthat much of what Darcy feelsKeneally experiencedBut it is into the mouth of one of Darcy's travelling companions that the heart of Keneally's emotional response to the Eritreans is putThis is an elderly Englishwoman who has inheritedfrom an aunt her engagement with the struggle against the mutilation of girl childrenor female circumcisionShe is the widow of a life peer but is referred to throughout as Lady Juliethe author indulging here in a little Pom-teasingLady Julie observesas Darcy has been observing with increasing awethe extraordinarily civilised behaviour of the Eritreanstheir exemplary treatment of prisoners 'We will insult you with our compassion'their well-organised aid programmestheir balanced egalitarianism and their passion for educating their children even under the most appallingly adverse conditionsFinally she is forced into exclaimingwith almost bewildered amazementThese people are itThe linkA new level of moral beingYou may think this is way over the topbut by the time he gets there the readerif he believes as I doin Keneally's veracitywill have experienced the same emotionDarcy focuses his own feelings on an Eritrean womana splendid bureaucratnow based in Frankfurt but currently visiting the front line to renew her networks of informationand dreams hazily of a future sexual relationship with her until he discovers that she had once undergoneat the hands of the Derguesuch stomach-churning extremes of physical torture that my distance from such a height of anguish disqualified meOf course it wouldIt is such universal perceptions as those of Darcy and Lady Julie that mark out Keneally as a major novelistOne mightas I usually do with one of his novelsquarrel mildly about his formal devicesbut that would be an irrelevant vanityHe makes the world

REVIEW Sissonpoet and commuter analystC J Fox welcomes the scorn and vigour shown by the memoirs of C H SissonOn the Look-OutC H SissonCarcanet14.95 poundsBy C J FOXC H SISSON poettranslatornovelistcriticpolemicistformer Whitehall mandarin and the candidate who should have won Oxford's Chair of Poetry has finally unveiled his life's storymost of it toldwith typical unconventionalitybackwardsIt begins in 1964 and works back to the author's birthIf anything can be concluded from this bookit is that I was bornwrites Sisson after touching on that eventwhich occurred 75 years ago in a building since occupied by the Bristol Rovers Supporters ClubThe author notwithstandingmany conclusions can be drawn from this steel-trap of a bookabout Berlin in Thirties turmoilfor exampleas observed by a keen-eyed young loner from BristolCertainly it can be concluded that the circumstances of Sisson's early life fuelled his salutary hatreds and helped form the outsider's perspective which now makes him a scourge of the age's insidious orthodoxiesSo it's with added comprehension that a reader of On the Look-Out can approach the taut ferocity of Sisson's early poems and the sombreness of those more recentthe jarring plainness of his Divine Comedy and other such translationsthe savagery of his two gaunt novelsand the war against fashion-induced mediocrity waged by Sisson the literary criticMore comprehensible too are his Seventies revolt fatal to his Whitehall careeragainst the trendy refurbishment of the Civil Service and his scorn for Official Culture and for further dilution of the Anglicanism he cherishesSisson's backgroundas now revealedwas the stark world of an artisan family stuck in down-at-heel BristolThe whole country was hostileits shabbiness I took for grantedSisson recalls about his school-age surroundingsI must have gone to and fro in great concentration of spiritalways anxious to get onThe concentration of the spiritenabled this solitary youth to achieve a prodigious amount of literary self-educationHe thus arrived at his city's University in the Depressionwell primed for encounters there with the suspect notions of EliotPound and T E HulmeBut Bristol wasn't Oxbridgewhich compounded his sense of alienation from the left-wingery of those high-flying Young GentlemenAudenSpender & CoStillSisson managed a Herr Issyvoosting of his own in the Nazified Berlin of 1934 and watched ideological street-squads slanging one another in Paris the next yearThe German sights in particulartorchlit orgies of Nazi triumphHitler ranting in Stuttgartstorm-troopers stamping out the last flickers of academic freedom in Freiburg showed him what lay in store for Europe and are vividly recounted hereThough he took his professional plunge into the Ministry of Labour soon afterwardsSisson also began writingtaking the outsider's route by contributing to obscure journals of the heterodoxyHis subsequent Wartime lot was equally offbeat though hardly agreeablecontending against boredom and filth along the northern marches of IndiaRe-immersion in the Ministry followed this prolonged servilitybut a breakthrough came with the Fifties publication of An Asiatic Romancea satirical fantasy explosively pointing up bureaucracy's absurdity and irrelevance in a world reduced to violence and cannibalismBy 1960Sisson was a top Civil Servant 'civil to everyoneand servant to the devil'and had published a treatise called The Spirit of British Administrationmemorable for its irony as well as its broad view of the subjectOf Pontius PilateThe steps he took to still a particular local clamour were more or less what the service requiredand he washed his hands with a civilised regretThe collections of his poetry began to appearnotably a searing logbook of life as a commuting careeristThe London ZooThe floodgates were now open and it is from here that the reverse sequence of On the Look-Out commencesThis partial autobiographybristles satiricallyManchesterfor instanceis deemed one of those disgraces by which the human race advertises the squalor and turpitude of its mindOf parish-pump politics in his old suburban nesting placeSevenoaksWhile everyone would pretend that a solution was what was wanted when there was a problemin fact what most people wanted was troubleThe fatal addiction of the human race to trouble is something whicheven at 50has not ceased to amaze meThe technique of reverse narrative is nothing new for SissonHis novelChristopher Hommtook its forlorn hero from septuagenarian death back to his doom-shrouded entry into lifeOn the Look-Out derives extra momentum from this eccentric procedureBut Sissonin addition to bringing his story up to date with a final chapterinterjects halfway through a lengthy segment on his warWith its subject-matter mainly the crushing ennui of that experiencethis section hampers the flow of the overall narrative somewhatdespite the crispness of its recollectionsMuch more telling as a crystallization of the Wartime ordeal is In the Rajincluded in that lynchpin volume of Carcanet's big Sisson listthe 1984 Collected PoemsBut as if to prove his powers of condensation in the autobiographySisson exercises remarkable reticence on matters of personal and family sentimentYet throughout he brandishes a fearless and confident individuality of judgementThere is exhilaration to be had from his fresh vistasvigorous assertions as they are of a truly independent mindBOOK REVIEW The cause without a rebelThe Pale CompanionAndrew MotionViking11.95 poundsBy MARTIN PACEYIT WAS unfair of Auden to suggestin his Letter to Lord Byronthat a poet's sense of other people's very hazyBut the vaporous presences that float through this slender and anaemic first novel by a notable poet would appear to support the claimThe book which opens a projected sequence of novels that will cover the period from 1968 to the present day aims to explore what the blurb describes as the painful transition from youth to adulthoodThisof courseis a popular subjectit seems particularly attractive to the poet-turned-novelist because of the scope it offers for the tremulously sensitive probing of feelingsSensitivitythoughis not enoughWhat Andrew Motion presents us with here is a static and humourless mood-piece filled with over-elaborate imageryThe heroFrancis Mayneis suffering from the adolescent's emotional confusion and acute self-consciousnessHe finds it hard to communicate with peoplenot least his separated parentsHis father is a faceless figurea retired brigadierreserved and taciturnHis motherby contrastis the most vividly realised character in the booknervyflirtatious and selfishalready on her third husbandshe thinks primarily of her appearanceeven when visiting her dying daughterFrancis's twinThe first half of the novel is dominated by the girl's death from leukaemiaThere is a refreshing simplicity and tenderness in Motion's account of the way Francis nurses herbut she herself is too sketchily drawn for the episode to carry much weightMeanwhileat his public schoolFrancis is conducting a love-affair with an older pupil named Keith OgilvieHe is finally rejected by the deviousarrogant Keithwho informs him that he is obsoletebecause he does not know how to make things happenHis response to this rejection is as flat as his reaction to the massive demonstration which Keith has earlier persuaded him to join against the Vietnam WarThis violent eventdescribed at length in hysterically colourful termsis the only piece of history to be woven convincingly into the plotOther broad hints as to the date are inserted with a comical lack of subtletyMy Goddarlinghave you heardexclaims Francis's mother one day as she greets himCzechoslovakiaIt's been invadedMotion will have to do better than this if he seriously intends his series of novels to capture the feel of a periodBut the book's principal defect remains the vacuity of its protagonistIn his eagerness to depict the cloudy psychology of an adolescentMotion has forgotten to give the boy a personalityHe hashowevergiven him a psychotic compulsion to formulate fanciful similesHardly a page goes by without the hapless Francis noticing something which reminds himimprobablyof something elseSometimes he is reminded of several thingsOne moment an avenue of chestnut trees looks like a child's drawing of ghoststhe next it appears frightening but derelictlike extinguished chandeliersand finally the chestnuts prance at himholding up their gleaming branches like hystericsSuch writing rapidly pallsand I hope that in the novels to comeMotion can curb his reckless passion for itBOOK REVIEW The tooth and the socketThe Bellarosa ConnectionSaul BellowPenguin3.50 poundsBy ANTHONY QUINNA TITLE like The Bellarosa Connection tends to imply two thingsfirstthat the book will be a jacket-straining 600 pagesand secondthat its author will be Robert LudlumNeither is the caseSaul Bellow's new novellahis second in six monthsis a mean 100 pagesComing from a writer whose reputation is built on largeexpansiveimprovisatory novelsthese two miniatures seem a bit of an anomalyor maybe just a diversionA Theft was exhilaratingbut it faded very quicklythis new onetoosuffers a slight anticlimactic wobble at its turning pointThe story is recounted by the unnamed founder of the Mnemosyne Institute in Philadelphiaan elderly widower who has recently retired after making his millions as instructor to executivespoliticians and members of the defense establishmentHis theme is memorya faculty with which he has been prodigiously blessedthough his origins as the child of Russian Jews from New Jerseyare held rather as a noble refusal to forgetThis same impulse leads him to recall the life of Harry Fonsteina distant friend who miraculously escaped the Nazi holocaustthanks to an underground operation masterminded by the Broadway impresario Billy Roseor Bella Rosaas his name sounds when whispered in excitable ItalianHaving arrived in New York via Cubathe immigrant Fonstein seeks out Rose in order to express an entirely natural gratitudebut is shunned at every turnHis letters are sent backand when he tries to approach Rose in a restaurant he is ignoredthen ejectedThe narrator identifies a larger issue behind this slightit is the conflict between two kinds of Jewishnessbetween the embattledcoarse-grained immigrant from Europe and the wordlygo-ahead Americanwho rates business acumen and individual assertion over the value of community tiesBilly is a thoroughly American creationa Broadway moguldandy and gossip columnist with a bug-like tropism for publicityHis bloated self-aggrandisement is puncturedhoweverby the formidable intervention of Harry's tiger wifeSorellaan enormous woman who brings out Bellow's near-parental tenderness for physical peculiarityHer obesity also represents a spiritual condition extended into bodily metaphorhers is an immensity of soulConfronting Billy with his unworthy behaviour towards her husbandshe exposes this legendas a cheap fakeWhen Sorella recounts this face-offit's also intended as a moment of recognitionan anagnorisisfor the narratorYet her candour and self-knowledge I am built like a Mack truckMy flesh is boundlesshardly qualify as a testament to a major force of personalityDoes Bellow think we should be amazedThese insights look rather small when set next to his previous books of revelationsIf there has been a diminution in the voltagehoweverthere are compensating pleasures of witEven the minor characterisations in this book bristle with prickly detailthe narrator's unloved Aunt Mildred had a powdered looklike her own strudelWolfeone of Billy's ghost-writersbuilds up his reputation as a weirdo nihilistHe wants to become the Thomas Mann of science fictionThis dry contempt strolls out even when its target is invisiblethe narrator telephones the Fonsteins' house years after they have lost contact and is answered by a young manon whom he forms an immediate image a thick head of haira beer pauncha T-shirt with a logo or sloganAct Up was a popular oneThe conversation which follows is the last in the bookand the weakesttooa stagey means of imparting some crucial news for Bellow to fulminate against all that is rotten and cynical in American youthIt's passionately feltfor surebut perhaps not adequately dramatisedWhen that news hits himthe narrator seems to crumbleeven though a premonitory dream the night before has readied him for the shockShadows have lengthened stealthily in the course of The Bellarosa Connectiongathering for what Martin Amis described in later Bellow as last thingsleave-takingand final luciditiesand at the close there is a quietly affecting image of the narrator setting down his storyaloneAt times I feel like a socket that remembers its toothhe writestrying to retain some sense of the world even as he prepares to leave itBOOK REVIEW Alpine village idiomsOnce in EuropaJohn BergerGranta Books10.95 poundsBy HUGO BARNACLETHIS STRONG collection of stories is the second in a trilogy about the peasants of the French Alpswhere John Berger livesHe produces the stories at a craftsmanlike rateno more than one a yearso it is some time since the appearance of the first volumePig EarthThe cover photograph shows Berger gone nativein dark suitstiff collar and homburg hatfor all the world like a French shepherd a bergerin facton his way to a weddingIn our villageas in many villages in the world at that timethere was a souvenir shopone story goesYou could buy there skiers in glass bottlesclockwork marmotsgoat hornssunglassesimitation butter-churnsmy booksIt is part of Berger's purpose that he be seen as a village artisanPig Earth dealt with the traditional pattern of Savoyard lifeThis book is set against the breakdown of the pattern in recent timesthe next will concentrate on peasants who have moved to the cityBut the stories have a universal appeal simply as storiesand it is good that the underlying programme seldom obtrudes as badly as in the gift-shop passage abovewhere the helpful aside about tourism affecting rural culture worldwide strikes a primary-school noteThe gift-shop used to be a farmhouseone of several owned by the skinflint farmer Boris who made his fortune by never paying billsThe house now belongs to a buxom blonde from Lyonwife of a driving instructorWhen Boris began sleeping with hervillagers who wondered what would happen if the husband found out were told by wiser villagersIf you'd lived in a big town you'd know that the husband knowsBoris showered the woman with presentseventually including the house which was what she and her husbandreally wantedRealising that she had not loved himBoris then starved himself to deathBerger sets this story up by sayingSometimes to refute a single sentence it is necessary to tell a life storyone villager mistakenly claims that Boris died like one of his own sheepneglected and starvingwhereas the admittedly ill-tended flock was in fact killed by lightningHere Berger's roundaboutlocal-storyteller manner seems labouredIt works better in another piecebeginningIf every event which occurred could be given a namethere would be no need for storiesA young girl discovers that the old shepherd across the valleyher only friendis passionately in love with herDisturbedshe at once falls for a kindhandsome Italian woodcutterbecomes pregnant and elopesYears laterin Bergamoshe still teaches the old shepherd's phrases to her talking blue-rock thrushAs Berger askswhat was the old man's relation to the girl's babyNot quite the godfatherThere is indeed a certain nameless truth to this oneIt is a pity that Berger inserts passages told by the girlwhich do not fitIn contrast the title story is narrated entirely by the heroineand from mid-air tooHer son has taken her up in his hang-glider can you carry two on a hang-gliderand she recalls her life and loves as she sails over the old family farm and the nearby manganese factory where it all happenedBerger impersonates her to a faultboth in the superb egotism of female love It is painful for us to judge the man we've takenfor he's already ourslike a sonand in the certitudes of peasant thinkingI will tell you which men deserve our respectThe rest are pigshitThe best storiesthoughare perhaps the firstabout a middle-aged bachelor farming alone after his mother diesand the lastabout a member of the village brass band picking up a woman on a bus trip to VeniceThese are the most simply toldand they have a nicely judged lack of any obvious pointBerger's writing is wonderfully clearonce the book is opened it just reads itself outToilweatherhuman character and the quirks of animals are all graphically renderedas well as the way in which newly-lifted potatoes glow like children's shoulders after a day in the sunor in which the voice of a once-active young man now crippled by an accident becomes far-awaylike a priest's voice at the altarWhether as social document or as fiction the completed trilogy could beif fashion permitsa minor
