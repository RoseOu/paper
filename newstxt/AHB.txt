CityTreasury climbs down over fundsBy Roland GribbenTHERE was confusion yesterday about the affect on government spending and borrowing after the Treasury climbdown over the way subsidies from the European Commission are treatedUnofficial EC estimates suggest that provision has had to be made for about £2 billion in the £28 billion borrowing requirement for 1992–93 as a result of the policy shiftThe Treasury says the decision to change the basis of treatmentannounced by Peter LilleyTrade and Industry Secretaryon February 13came too late to affect the current year's figures but have been included in the 1993–94 estimatesPressure from Bruce MillanEC regional commissionerhas resulted in the Treasury reluctantly accepting that the funds provided by Brussels are additional to government spending rather than part of it and should be steered to specific projects rather than forming part of the spending poolTreasury insistence that EC contributions are taxpayers' moneyand should be counted as part of the public spending programme caused friction with the EC and Mr Millan froze money due to coal and steel areasCityNervous sterling mauled by the markBy Anne SegallTHE pound had another tense daystruggling to hold its own on the exchanges as investors waited nervously for weekend opinion polls before deciding their next moveDealers reported some overnight selling from Japan

managed to gain a cent to $1.7420 as the dollar succumbed even faster to mark pressureAnalysts said the surge in demand for marks followed the poor inflation figures the day beforewhich investors

of their profits overseasOptimism over the re-election prospects of the Conservative partywidespread among stockbrokers and fund managers only a couple of weeks agohas ebbed away and there is now more active consideration of other possible outcomesThe message from the strategists is that if the Tories winthe stocks to benefit will be the cyclical oneswhose fortunes would be boosted by a swift end to recessionIf Labour wins or there is a hung Parliamentthen the cyclicals are best sold in favour of overseas earners like BOCShellGrand Metropolitan and BAT IndustriesPrivatised utilities could suffer too although in many cases share prices are already reflecting thisThe risk of devaluationa prime reason for preferring overseas earnersis highest if there is a Labour-led government in a hung Parliament according to Kleinwort Benson market watcher Trevor LaugharneDavid Bint of Credit Lyonnais Laing is sanguine about the long-term differences in the macroeconomic outlook under governments of different political huespointing to the constraints of the exchange rate mechanism and the size of the deficit in the Government's financesBut he believes that in the short termif Labour wins or a hung Parliament causes extended political uncertaintythen recession could drag onIn either case United Kingdom-linked companies are best avoidedas prolonged recession would result in more company

preparing to launch the biggest tax assault ever on middle income families while claiming that he does not know what the effect of his tax hike will be on incentivesconfidence or on the economyAsked a few pertinent questions on Thursday's Question Time television programmehe was reduced to mumbling about an academic study by a distinguishedStirling University economistSadlythis guru died before passing on any decisive conclusionThe man who hopes to be Chancellor next week cannot surely be preparing a leap in the darkIf his taxes did deter hard workthe economy would wiltjobs would be lost and he and his colleagues would run short of the tax revenue for financing their favourite causesNobody would win and his tax victims would suffer in vainMr Smith implicitly recognises the disincentive effectHe has been careful to confine his biggest tax penalties to those trappedsalaried employees who cannot substitute leisure for workwhile giving the self-employed special dispensation from higher National Insurance contributionsThis suggests he is worried that those who can might rather walk the dog or paint the house than work for miminal benefitYet Mr Smith is not only proposing to raise tax in one go by more than anyone has ever dared to before but also concentrating the effect on a relatively small groupThis will cause economic disruption comparable with a hike in oil prices or interest ratesThe Keynesian economists on whom Mr Smith relies claim that the impact of his redistributive taxes will be negligiblesince the money taken from the better off will be redistributed to lower earnersSince total income is unchangedthese apologists see little reason to worry about the sectoral and regional effectsclaiming that consumption will hardly changeThis is the conclusion reached by the National Institute of Economic & Social Research and London Business SchoolBut Mr Smith should not put too much trust in their findingsHe will probably find his Treasury advisers are far less sanguinethe Treasury believes that the same factors which produced the late 1980s' consumer boom are now working in reversewith falling confidence and asset values undermining consumption though incomes are relatively buoyantMr Smith should listenCity CommentHomeowner will be one who suffersTHERE is no need for Mr Smith to impose taxes on capital or on financial institutions thoughhis policies look set to do their damage by knocking the most valuable asset owned by most voters their homesHouse pricesalready up to one-fifth below their peaklook more likely to fall far further under a Labour government than to reviveGood news for first-time buyersNot if a month later their house is worth less than they paidNor is it good news for the majority of people who already own-especially those who became first-time buyers over the past four years and whose complete capital has been wiped outmore than a million such people are probably technically bankrupt but need not admit it so long as they keep paying their mortgageSuch people are effectively under house arrestThey cannot move until values again exceed the size of their loanThose one step up the housing ladder may have had more equity in their home to absorb falling valuesbut they cannot move eitherunless those former first-time buyers can trade upTrueit is the people at the bottom of the ladder and below it who benefit from Mr Smith's thin tax cuts but £100 a year helps little and the saving would be more than eliminated by an upward move in mortgage ratesThe majority of owners are above average earnershoweverand if higher taxes reduce take-home paythey will find it harder to take on larger loansPrices and values cannot be higher than what people can pay which meanshow much people can borrow and lendersbelatedly learning prudenceare no longer willing to give the high multiples of gross income they did in the 1980s or the high proportion of priceAll this will combine to keep the lid on pricesBut on top of this mathematical restraint on prices there is the confidence factorWho wants to buy a home if the mortgage costs may risepay is set to fall and values look like followingAs neither political party can cut unemployment overnightthat fear will continue to discourage potential purchasers and add to the tally of repossessions which is flooding the market with unwanted homesIndeedthe financial institutions would be hit by a continued slip in house pricesPotential purchasers can willingly stay out of the market and owners can stay putbut lenders and the insurance companies which share the losses will face yet further provisions as more repossessed homes are sold at a lossMr Smith must learn that hitting the pay packet hits the housing marketand that hits the institutionsThere are enough problems for the occupier of 11 Downing Street without adding a crisis at the banks or building societiesCity CommentTime to come down hard on softingBEST-EXECUTION' an adviser or broker dealing on the best available terms was one of the pillars on which the Financial Services Act was built six years agoYesterday the Securities & Investments Boardthe champion of that Actcame perilously close to removing

regard it as so close to bribery it should be bannedIndependent soft-commission brokers regard it as an acceptable method of payment so long as they deal at the best priceBut even they complain at

for a period of years in order to avoid taxthose dependent on income particularly those subject to Pay As You Earn have limited scope to fend off the taxmanBroadly speakingtheir best strategies to cope with a Labour win would be to ensure they make the most of allowances created through the independent taxation of husbands and wivesand where possible to take income on a self-employed basis rather than as employeesMarried coupleswhere one of the spouses has little or no incomeshould transfer income from deposits and investments into the account of the non-working spouse to use up his or her allowance that isa slice of tax free incomeFor this tax yearthe individual personal allowance is £3,295 and the married couples allowance is £1,720Next yearstarting on Mondaythe personal allowance rises to £3,445 but the married one is unchangedEmployees might also seek to change their status to self-employed and work for the same companyor otherson a consultancy basisAlternativelythey could seek to arrange their affairs so that part of their income is received on a self-employed basisrather than being treated as overtimeThe reason is that Labour said it will retain the present National Insurance contributions ceiling for the self employed at £21,060 whereas employees will suffer an additional 9 p.c. deduction on earnings above that thresholdBut the Inland Revenue has already warned that it will investigate any changes of status to ensure that they are genuineIn additionmany employers are reluctant to allow employees to change status because they could be liable for unlimited arrears payments of National Insurance if these are subsequently disallowed by the taxmanMoney-Go-RoundBES might look better with LabourBy IAN COWIEBUSINESS Expansion Schemes share issues may appeal to those who can forego access to part of their savings for five years in return for sheltering these funds from taxIndeedassurances from Labour that the abolition of the BES will not be retrospective could increase attractionsAt presentBES investors can claim relief at their top rate of tax and take gains tax-free after five yearsSo BES stock with a nominal value of £1,000 costs a top-rate

on incomeafter allowancesof £36,375 or moreThus the real cost of £1,000 worth of BES shares to anybody earning more than that during the fiscal yearwhich starts on Mondaywould be only £500No growth in the BES company at allafter chargeswould be necessary for this investment to double in value over five yearsBut it is important to distinguish between high-risk BES issues and those that are virtually banking contractsalbeit underwritten by housing associations and educational institutionsThose in the high-risk category arebroadlythose which invest in trading companies or which lack an assured means of turning this unquoted stock back into cashBy contrastcontracted-exit BES issues have already signed covenants or agreements with institutions which will enable shareholders to realise their investmentsThis type of BES has raised £340m this tax year compared with less than £50m in the riskier offeringsThe determining factor in choosing between contracted-exit funds is the quality of the covenant how secure is the institution underwriting the realisation valueBES analyst Anthony Yadgaroff saidThe best of these have already been fully-subscribedbut one exception is Close Brothers Bessa

investment and could also be best for taxpayers who fear reduced returns on deposits if Labour winsTaking funds out of deposit accounts and using them to repay mortgages will be particularly attractive for high earners who no longer receive mortgage interest relief at the upper rate thanks to Mr Lamont and who might suffer up to 50 p.c. deductions on savings' earningsTakefor examplea homebuyer with a £50,000 mortgage who also has £10,000 in a 90-day Halifax Building Society accountThe deposit currently earns £710 per annum after deduction of 25 p.c. taxbutif Labour winsthe post-tax return would fall to £473 per annum if subject to the new top rateAssuming unchanged interest ratesinterest on the £50,000 mortgage comes to £4,656but if the £10,000 were taken off deposit and used to diminish the mortgage to £40,000 the annual cost falls to £3,564So moving £10,000 from a deposit account to diminish a debt will save this person £1,092 per annum at an opportunity cost

stockBy MALCOLM CRAIGINVESTORS who fear that membership of the European Monetary System will not prevent a resurgence of inflation in coming years should examine the virtues of index-linked giltsThis form of government stock can beif held directlyas safe as the Bank of Englandalthough that certainty disappears if the gilts are not sold before maturity or held in a managed fundThey guarantee that for every £100 nominal worth of gilts bought by an investor£100 will be paid on maturityplus the increase in the Retail Prices Index over the years to that maturityThere is also a smallyearly rate of interestIs this the right time to consider adding such gilts to your portfolioDavid Newtonhead of gilts trading at Barclays de Zoete WeddsaidThe longer-dated gilts in this sector have suffered as a result of the government's higher-than-expected borrowing requirementThe most attractive gilts are in the middle maturity section of the spectrumThe 2½ p.cTreasury 2001 and the 2 p.c. 2006 are particularly attractive to the high rate tax payerAt a 40 p.c. marginal rate of tax the real yield over and above inflation is 3¼ p.cAt a 59 p.c. tax rate the real yield would be 2¾ p.cThis outperforms the return on conventional gilts of the same maturity so long as inflation is above 1 p.c. to 2 p.cGiven that the index-linked gilt is a difficult investment to evaluateis it worth the private investor buying via a specialist gilt fund or directDerek McLeanfund manager of Abbey Life Investment Services which provides two gilt and fixed interest unit trustssaidWe have included short dated index-linked gilts in our Capital and Reserve TrustOne drawback is the higher dealing costs for index-linked giltsThe market is less liquid and market-makers quote wider pricesThere is a tax difference as between private investors buying such gilts direct and buying via a fundsuch as oursin that the former strategy is exempt from capital gains taxHoweverthe tax difference is small and affects relatively few peopleIndex-linked gilts are complex investments to assess and the investor does obtain professional management by buying via a specialist fundFor examplewhen working out the redemption yieldthe investor must make assumptions as to the future level of inflationIn additionthere is continual switching between the conventional gilt market and the index-linkedThis can mean that the latter does not move in response to levels of inflation in the way that the private investor thinks it shouldA rise in the inflation rate can be bad for both conventional and index-linked giltsThere is also the question of supply and demandThere is little doubt that under any future administration we will get a larger supply of index-linked giltsFor the investor who decides to buy direct rather than invest via a gilt unit trustwhich may have a front end charge of 6 p.c. plus an annual management feethe cheapest buying route is via the Post OfficeThe National Savings Stock Register can be used to hold more than 80 p.c. of the different types of giltsThe charge is 10p per £10 on sales of less than £100rising to £1 on sales purchases not exceeding £250 and 50p for every subsequent £125 transactionInterest paid on gilts bought via the register is gross of taxBuying such gilts via a stockbroker normally incurs a higher costThe index-linked gilts on the market have maturities of up to 2024 and most of them stand at a substantial premium to their par valueThis is proof of the erosive effects of past inflation rate which climbed to banana republic levels in the 1970sSurprisingly there is only one index-linked gilt unit trustit is run by Guinness FlightThis is primarily designed for smallself-administered pension fundsMoney-Go-RoundSwotting up on school feesWHILE the recession has reduced many families' incomesschool fees have continued to rise at about twice the rate of inflationSome boarding schools charge up to £10,000 per annum so its little wonder that a rising number of children are being taken away and placed in cheaper day schools or back into state schoolsThere are several ways to save for school fees but whichever method you choose it is best to start eight to 10 years before the first child enters schoolThe most common fees plans involve lump sum investment or regular savingsOften a combination of both proves to be the best formulaA fourth option only to be used as a desperate measure is to take a loan usually as a second charge on the family homeA minimum of £60,000 would be needed to cover fees for two children attending public school from age nine to 18Lump sum investments can take advantage of the charitable status of public schools by paying into an educational trust run by the schools themselves or the life officesThe lump sum is invested to buy an increasing or unit-linked annuity which in turn is used to pay the feesBut Tony Murrellmanaging director of financial advisers Fraser Marr saidIn most circumstances we would not recommend the use of educational trusts because these can only be used for school fees nothing elseIf you change your mind or your child gets a scholarshipfor examplethere is a stiff surrender penalty on top of which a tax penalty could be incurredMost parents do not have a large lump sum to invest and have to rely on regular savings plans sometimes boosted by a modest capital investmentMr Murrell's approach aims to combine a series of investments within a school fees portfolioFor exampleNational Savings Chidren's Bonus Bonds offer a guaranteed tax-free return of 11.84 p.c. after five yearsThe maximum investment per child is £1,000For monthly savingsMr Murrell recommends Friendly Society plans over a 10-year period because the money grows tax freeBut the maximum amount that can be invested is £18 a monthMr Murrell saidIn the short term we recommend the safety first approachUnder this heading parents might go for a mixture of building society deposits or National Savings certificatesSuitable investment vehicles over the medium to long term include tax exempt special savings accountspersonal equity plansunit trusts and investment trustsStephen Whiteheadof Whitehead & Partnersanother school fees specialistrecommends various savings options depending on the period before the first school fees fall dueIf this is between one and four years he suggested the safest route is a simple building society deposit accountIf there are more than five years to go before the child is due to start school then tax exempt special savings accounts can be a safe optionFor more bullish clients he might suggest a maximum of 25 p.c. of the monthly saving could go into a PepMoney-Go-RoundIndividuals more optimistic about rising stock marketBy IAN

charging structure into line with those in America and Europe are adoptedThe complex bid to offer pricing system British investors are expected to understand should be replaced by a system where unit trusts or mutual fundsdeal at a single price with any charges clearly addedit is arguedChanges are already underwaySome management companiesincluding Murray Johnstone which recently reduced its initial charge from 5 to 1 p.c. welcomed the Securities & Investment Board announcement this week that it is to review its rules on unit trustsA green paper containing proposals for the liberalisation of charging methodssingle pricing and other important reforms should be published by the end of the yearSIB saidOne problem with the current regime is demonstrated by the quandary Murray Johnstone finds itself inLike all United Kingdom unit trust providers with the exception of Lazards Merchant Bank which offers investors free entry into all eight of its unit trusts minimum investment £5,000Murray Johnstone has traditionally relied on commission hungry financial advisers to introduce its businessSince it can only pay advisers a standard 3 p.c. commission by loading its funds with an equivalent chargeit runs the substantial risk of losing business now that the charge has been cutRichard Eliott Lockhartmanaging directorsaid this week that ideally he would have liked to have compromisedRather than dropping his company's commission bearing charge completelyhe would have preferred to have reduced it and moved it from the front to the back end of his unit trusts that ischarging investors as they leave the fund rather than as they enterHe saidOriginally we went for an American-style back-end load or exit charge which was tapered to reduce by a percentage point for each year an investment was heldThis was blockedthe current rules do not allow itThe prime advantage of an exit charge would have been to the investor because he would have got into our funds at a nil cost and out again at a very low cost if he held his investment forsaythree yearsNew rules forcing all unit trust companies to disclose clearly their charges would also increase competition on prices and with the introduction of exit charges encourage longer term saving rather than speculationIn Americaand to a lesser extent Europesuch choice is already evidentOf the 222 new American funds launched last year99 were of the Lazards variety and carry no initial or exit chargesJust 87 had charges ranging from 4 to 8 p.c.while the remainder had either very low charges or long term investment encouraging exit charge arrangementsOn all of these fundscharges are clearly visible to investors and are made in addition to the single price at which units are purchasedIn Britainwith our complex bid to offer systeminvestors often think that the standard 5 p.c. or 6 p.c. initial charge is all they must paywhen in fact the spread between a unit trust's offer and bid prices can be much greaterMary Blaira director of Fidelitywhose parent company runs no-loadfunds in AmericasaidGreater flexibility on charges would certainly be welcome and exit charges are something we would be quite interested to look atFlexibility would increase competition between providers which will benefit investorsIt will open the doors much wider to product innovationUnder the Financial Services Act such innovation has been sadly stifledMrs Blair added that any move away from the bid and offer system to single pricing would not be accepted if it threatened to reduce or dilutethe value of existing unit holders investmentsI think that any down-side would more than be offset by the increased simplicity which single pricing would bring the clientallowing him or her to see exactly what they are gettingThriving under the feet of elephants Quentin Cowdry goes to see a giant-slaying small firm which ismaking big tracks in the business of building real-life train setsBy QUENTIN COWDRYCOMPLACENCY is almost a sacking offence at Hunslet Transportation Projectsthe Birmingham-based firm which in June 1990 startled railway experts by winning a contract to supply 37 electric passenger trains to Regional RailwaysIt was a remarkable achievement for a company created just over a year earlier and which had had to pitch against some of the world's largest train-buildersincluding GEC AlsthomSiemensand BRELthe dominant British manufacturerSeventeen months later the firmwhich employs barely 100 peoplecarried off another giant-slaying trick by landing a £38 million trains order for the Malaysian railway KTM in the face of competition from BREL and a leading Japanese manufacturerIn both contract races Hunslet benefited greatly from its low overheadsBut running between the feet of elephantsas the company colourfully describes its market positionis a dangerous businessparticularly when the trend in the train-building industry is towards the creation of larger international suppliersManagement at Hunslet is acutely aware of the risks of operating in a sector acutely vulnerable to too much or too little government interferenceIts order book is now approaching £150 millionOur aim is to provide excellence in the designproject management and assembly of smaller railway rolling stock contractssays Peter Johnsonone of the firm's directorsEssentially the company is a project management operationA core team of technicans and engineersall with backgrounds in the rail industrydesign rolling stock to the most exacting specifications and then oversees construction using components from various countriesThe original intention was to hive off assembly operations to sub-contractorsBut a reorganisation last year within Telfos HoldingsHunslet's parent companypresented the firm with an unmissable opportunity to acquire a 100,000 sq ft factory at Telfos's headquarters in LeedsThe Regional Railways order made waves not only because it went to a newcomer in train-buildingThe design chosen was the most innovative of those submitted a train made from an aluminium bodyshell and driven by a novel A.C. motor which saves some of the energy created when trains brake and feeds its back to the overhead power supplyHunslet claims its trainsbased on three cars with a driver's cab at either endwill use 30 per cent less energy than similar electric modelsThe capital cost of Hunslet's traction equipmentsupplied by a Netherlands firmis higher than that of many D.C. varietiesbut Regional Railways accepted the argument that it would work out cheaper long-term because of its economic use of energy and low maintenanceDesigned to run on heavily-used urban networksthe trainsdesignated Class 323can seat 289 passengersThey are to be used in West Yorkshire and the Birmingham and Manchester areas to replace ageing diesel and electric rolling stockRegional Railways has been assured that they will knock 16 minutes off the journey between Redditch and Lichfield in the West MidlandsThe first results of the order said to be worth about £81 million are due on the network this summerPeter Johnson saysWe're hoping that our pollution-free and energy-efficient units will mark the start of a new generation of sophisticated electric trains which will eventually run all over the Regional Railways networkHunslet is also breaking new ground with its Malaysian contractThe trains it has designed will be the first electric rolling stock to run on Malaysia's rail systemGanz HunsletHungary's largest train-builder Telfos Holdings was one of the
