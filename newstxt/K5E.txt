Astronomy device may help fight cancerBy Bryan Christie Health CorrespondentA SCANNING system developed by astronomers for classifying stars is exciting the medical world with its potential to detect breast cancer at an early stageThe developmentfirst reported in The Scotsman three years agoopens up the possibility of being able to treat the first signs of breast cancer when the chances of success are highestThe Royal Observatory of Edinburgh has applied for funding to develop the system for use with patientsThese negotiations are at a delicate stage and senior staff at the observatory preferred to make no official comment when contacted yesterdayThe computerised system they are working onknown as Super Cosmoswas developed to spot new stars among thousands of specks on photographic plates exposed through giant telescopesIt soon became clear that the same system could be used to readbreast X-rays and uncover the earliest signs of diseaseDr Harvey McGillivrayhead of the Observatory's COSMOS unit told The Scotsman in 1990 that it could take a trained observer up to 20 minutes to scan an X-ray plate by eyewith no certainty of spotting abnormalitiesThe Super Cosmos system is capable of scanning an X-ray plate in minutes and will eliminate inconsistency in diagnosisSoftware being produced by scientists at Manchester University will allow the Super-Cosmos equipment to spot particular features on X-rays every timeAny suspicious images can then be double-checked by a radiologist before any decision is taken to treat the patientScientists at the observatory are also investigating other uses for the systemIn 1990 it was being used to measure the presence of minute underwater bubbles which can detect the presence of submarinesand it has also been applied to study polymer fibre patterns in research on materials for plastic mouldsTechnology dogs strays' footstepsBy Tom MortonTRACKING down the stray dogs of Inverness may soon be easier

my aunt suffering daily from the most common problem of the menopausethe hot flushThe term flushdoes not translate the intensity of heat and discomfort experiencedEach eveningas she prepared the evening mealthe heat would start at her waistspread up the chesther face would suffuse to crimson and her cheeks puff upAfter throwing the plates on the tableshe would rush out into the garden in an attempt to cool downThere she would stay for up an hour in shirt-sleeves in the pitch-darksometimes in the snowwhile the bewildered family shivered insideBewildering and distressing is a fitting

suffered in silencesomething to do with female hormonesalways a bother at the best of timesand something gynaecologicalOn all counts a taboo subjectBut since the 1950shormone replacement therapyor

added her own paean of praiseIt's like a carpet underlay through lifeIt gives you an expectationan anticipationyou don't know what will happen nextA recent survey of Scottish gynaecologists revealed that 99 per cent of them would recommend HRTgiven the right medical circumstancesYet only 9 per cent of women who could benefit are taking up the optionWhy the discrepancyThe surveycarried out by Dr Helen McEwan and Dr Mary Campbell-Brown of Glasgow Royal Infirmary reported that many women fear not enough is known about the long-term consequencesOthers think it tampers with nature although unlike the contraceptive pill which tops up hormonesHRT simply restores them to their previous and natural levelThose involved in research into the drug and with the women taking it are mainly enthusiasticThe trouble isas Rosemary Nicol points out in her book Hormone Replacement TherapyYour Guide to Making An Informed ChoiceHRT is not simply a matter of going to your GP and getting a prescriptionThere are over 20 combinations of HRT and it has to be tailored to the individualWhile a first attempt may work wonders for somefor others the dosage may need to be changedthe type of HRT altered or the frequency loweredMany give up at the first hurdle before discovering the eventual and significant rewardsNicol believes each woman must balance the severity of her symptoms and the long-term benefits of HRT with the possible risks attachedThe only way to reach an informed decision is to understand what the menopause entails and exactly how HRT worksThe many and various symptoms of the menopause have but one causea fall in the level of the female hormoneoestrogenWhile oestrogen levels are highthe blood vessels remain in good conditionthe walls of the vagina are thick and elasticbones remain strong and skin bloomsAs the menopause approachesthere is a gradual decline in the amount of oestrogen produced each monthThe first symptoms which may be felt are hot flushesnight sweatsgeneral anxiety and irritabilityloss of self-esteeminsomniamood changespoor memoryloss of confidenceloss of interest in sex and even formication the feeling of insects crawling just underneath or on top of the skinprobably caused by changes in the nerve endingsIn fact75 per cent of menopausal women suffer from flushes and they constitute the commonest reason for women turning to HRTSince the problem is that of the blood vessels dilating and constricting due to lack of oestrogentopping up the levels of oestrogen the essence of HRTcauses the flushes to lessen within daysbefore disappearingHRT is similarly successful with night sweatsSome GPs prescribe tranquillisers and anti-depressants for the related insomnia and irritabilityThiscomments Nicolis difficult to justify as the problem is due to falling oestrogen and nothing elsePart of the brain contains many oestrogen receptors and when oestrogen levels fallmood changes may occurThere are still too many doctors who will say I'm afraid it's just your agemy dearor You'll just have to live with itsays NicolYet once the oestrogen is replaced by HRTmost women find their confidence and self-esteem restored and problems with mood-swingsforgetfulness and anxiety considerably alleviatedHRT is also of benefit for the intermediate symptoms of the menopausethose that do not appear until some time after periods have stopped but which tend to get more noticeable and troublesome as the years go byThese include bladder problemssuch as stress incontinencerecurrent bacterial infectionsvaginal drynesspain during sexual intercourse and thinning skin and hairAs many as 50 per cent of women complain of vagina or bladder problems in the years after the menopauseMarie Brown thought she was one of the fortunate ones to sail through unaffectedThentwo or three years after her periods stoppedshe encountered vaginal drynessA female GP recommended KY jellyIt was not the most enticing of substancesand Marie returned to the surgerythis time to see a male GPHe suggested HRTaddingmy mother recommends itApart from the shock that her GP saw her in the same light as his aged motherMarie has never looked backShe has been on HRT for four yearshas never suffered dryness again and attributes to it her general energy and enjoyment of lifeThe long-term effects of the menopause are possibly the most importantan increased risk of arterial disease and osteoporosiswhere bones become fragile and brittleUntil the age of 40 or 50men are far more at risk of heart disease than womenThis is thought to be the protective effect of oestrogenwhich lowers the level of the badcholesterol low-density lipoproteinand raises the level of the goodhigh-density lipoproteinBut after the menopausea woman's risk of having a heart attack or stroke increasesAccording to Rosemary Roe of the National Osteoporosis Societyoestrogen therapy can also reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by as much as a thirdThere is a further plus pointat an age when the major arteries of the body are narrowingHRT is thought to widen them and so allow blood to flow more freelyEven women of 70 can benefit from this protective effect of HRTThere are several causes of osteoporosis but the most common is lack of oestrogenBone contains two main types of cells calledconfusinglyosteoclasts and osteoblastsAll through our livesthe osteoclasts wear away microscopic craters in the boneand the osteoblasts fill these craters with newly formed boneOestrogen is thought to reduce the rate at which bone is dissolved and to increase the rebuilding processOnce oestrogen levels fallthe bone becomes less dense and strong and more liable to fractureHip fractures are potentially life threatening they result in 40 premature deaths a daywhile crushed spinal vertebrae may lead to back painloss of height and mobilityand eventually curvature of the spineSometimes a vertebra will fracture with excruciating painon other occasionsit will break painlesslyRecent research shows that only one in ten spinal fractures is being seen by a doctorThe stoop known as Dowager's Hump is caused by osteoporosisThere is considerable evidence that starting oestrogen therapy within two years of the menopauseand staying on it for at least five yearscan reduce your risk of fracture by 50 to 60 per centIf you menopause earlyeither naturally or through hysterectomyyour risk of osteoporosis is far greater and the National Osteoporosis Society recommends you stay on it longerBut if HRT can achieve such a range of benefitswhy aren't women queuing up in drovesThe cloud in this particular silver lining is progestogena synthetic form of the hormone progesteroneProgesterone is produced in the ovaries after the ovulation phase of the menstrual cycle and among its functionsprepares the womb for a fertilised egg by thickening the lining of the wombDuring a cycle which doesn't result in pregnancyit is the production of progesterone which contributes to pre-menstrual bloatingbreast tenderness and general irritabilityProgesterone is thus a mixed blessing and its presence in HRT is the single most important reason why women abandon itIn the 1950s and 1960soestrogen therapy was used by women in America so the phrase went they could be feminine foreverBut by the 1970sa link was discovered with an increase in cancer of the endometrium the lining of the wombIt emerged that when oestrogen was taken on its ownthe lining of the womb would build up each month and remain there instead of being shed as a periodEventuallythe lining would become abnormally thickened and in some women it became cancerousThe solution was to add a form of the hormone progesterone so that the lining was shed not as a period but as an artificial withdrawal bleedThis is still the norm for women who have not had a hysterectomyby taking progestogen with oestrogen for ten to 12 days each monthcancer of the endometrium is no longer an increased riskIn factit is less of a risk for women taking combined HRT than those on noneFor most womenthe number one advantage of the menopause is no more periodsyet here they are againalbeit in lighter formAnd with them PMT weight gainirritabilityacnegreasy skinlow interest in sexSmall wonder many women call a haltNicol's message is don't be put offparticularly now when research is moving fastSome symptoms such as weight gain vanish of their own accordIf problems do remain after two or three monthsask your doctor about changing to a different type of progestogenThere are different types availableand various dosages within each typeso there is a good chance you will eventually find a combination of oestrogen and progesterone that suits youThe good news is that research is being done into new and better progestogensUntil recentlythis hormone could only be taken in the form of tablets by mouthAs much of the oestrogen gets lost as it passes through the digestive systemquite a large dose has to be taken initially and this large dose causes most side-effectsProgestogen is now available in a combined progestogen and oestrogen patchIn this formthe two hormones are absorbed by the skin and since the digestive system is avoideda much lower dose can be given to achieve the desired effectthereby reducing the side-effectsThere remains one other fly in the ointmentand a significant one at that a greater chance of developing breast cancerIt appears the risk increases with the length of time HRT is taken and the higher the dose of oestrogenThere appears to be no significant risk to women who take it for less than five years but the risk does increase slightly between five and ten yearsand taking it for more than 15 years gives a higher risk stillOne daysays

conditionMore than anythingWilson misses the fun and games that he should be able to enjoy with his three young childrenand that he did enjoybefore the symptoms beganHe is one of hundreds of sheep farmers who are convinced their illness often accompanied by nauseaheadachesblurred vision and muscle spasms is caused by organophosphorus OPcompounds in sheep dipAnd he complains bitterly that exhaustive health tests were not done years agoRecentlyWilson was part of a clinical study which adds considerable weight to repeated claims that the liquids used on 95,000 British farmsto treat 40 million sheepcould be the cause of permanent damage to the nervous systemThe results of the surveycarried out by Dr Goran Jamal at Glasgow's Southern General Hospitalwill be revealed tonight on a Channel 4 Close to Home documentaryproduced by the Edinburgh independent companyBarony Film and Television ProductionsWhat this study showedsaid Dr Jamal is undisputed evidence of peripheral nerve damageOrganophosphate should remain in the dock until it is proven innocentHe carried out 24 tests on 16 randomly selected farmers who had complained of debilitating illness following dippingIn all 16 cases he found nerve damageThe resultson virtually every testdiffered markedly from a control group of healthy adultsFor many of the farmers involvedthe news is devastatingBut it is what they had fearedA large number are incapable of heavy workand have given up their farmsThe findings were entirely consistent with organophosphorus poisoningThe damage may be permanentand treatment is non-existentThe programme does not apportion blameor claim a conclusive linkbut it points up the lack of long-term monitoring on people working with the chemicalsand suggests warning labels on the products do not always make clear what type of protective clothing is suitableThe issue of clothing is crucial to the debatealthough critics question whether such dangerous chemicals should be used under any conditionsToday the Government is still advising farmers that the products if used properly are safeThe labelling on the concentrated dip does include safety instructionsHoweveron the brand checked by The Scotsmanthe use of a face shield was only advised while mixing the concentrateand not while dippingWarning instructions do not suggest the use of respiratorsIn realityfew farmers wear complete protection at the tankand the operation is so messy that liquid is bound to get on the smallest area of exposed skinAnd there is a body of opinion which suggests damage can be caused by inhalationas well as through direct contact with the skin or mouthFor years farmers have complained of temporary dipping fluafter treating their sheepWith legal action now a possibilitythe Government

many inherited disorderswrites Gillian HarrisAN EIGHT-MONTH-OLD girl from LennoxtownStirlingshiremade British medical history yesterday when she became the first person to start gene therapy to combat a potentially fatal deficiencyCarly Todd received the first stage of the treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital in LondonDoctors removed bone marrow from her pelvis into which will be injected specially altered genes which are responsible for making the cells of the immune systemCarly suffers from an immune system deficiency which killed her 14-month-old brother Greig four days before she was bornHer body does not make an enzyme called Adenosine Deaminase ADAwhich is needed for a fully developed immune systemWithout it she is vulnerable to infection which her body cannot fightMost sufferers die in childhoodHoweverwith a gene transplantdoctors at Great Ormond Street who have been working with scientists from the University of Leiden in Holland hope to reprogramme Carly's genes to enable her to protect herself against infectionGareth Morgana senior lecturer in immunologysaidThe proposed treatment is a novel strategy for the management of genetic defects and results of this particular case will be closely observed as it may open the way forward for the treatment of many more inherited disordersFor the next few days the bone marrow which was taken from Carly will be incubated with the reprogrammed cells in a laboratory in LeidenIt will be returned to Great Ormond Street on Monday and given to Carlyprobably through a dripA spokeswoman for the hospital saidIt will be a couple of months before we can tell if the treatment has been successfulIn the meantime we will monitor her progress very closelyAfter a fortnight Carly will undergo blood tests so that doctors can check for any chemical alterationsPrevious experiments with gene therapyinvolving one Italian and two American childrenhave so far only altered blood cells rather than bone marrow cells and have had to be repeated monthly because of the cells' limited life spanIf successfulgene therapy could eventually offer effective treatment for as many as 4,000 hereditary illnessesincluding cystic

leukaemiaBy Bryan ChristieHealth CorrespondentAN EXCESS of leukaemia cases has been found among children in rural parts of Scotland linked to the growth of the North Sea oil industryA report today suggests that oil workers may have been responsible for the situation by bringing in an infectious agent such as a virus against which local children had no protectionThe report offers further evidence that some cases of childhood leukaemia may be caused by infection and notas has been previously been suggestedby exposure to such things as nuclear radiationLeukaemia cases in children under four were almost double the expected number in rural areas which had the highest concentrations of oil-related workersSixteen cases were expected during 1979-83 but 31 actually occurredDr Leo Kinlenthe director of the Cancer Research Campaign's epidemiology unit in Oxfordwho carried out the researchhas produced a series of studies pointing to an infectious agent being involved in leukaemiaHis theory is that leukaemia is a rare response to a much more common butas yetunidentified infection which is transmitted when large numbers of people from different backgrounds come togetherDr Kinlenwho previously worked at Edinburgh Universityhas already found an excess of childhood leukaemia cases around military camps and new townswhich both feature large population movementsHe decided to test the theory further by examining the background of more than 17,000 Scottish-based oil workersThe crowded conditions they lived in were ideal for passing on an infectious agentHe drew up a map of Scotland based on where the men lived and found the excess of cases in children from rural areas who had been exposed to those menAlthough more oil workers live in urban areas such as Glasgow and Aberdeenno excess of cases was found thereDr Kinlen says children in densely populated urban areas are likely to have been exposed to the infectious agent and built up an immunity to itIt is only in remote areas which have never been exposed to the infection that the problem occursHe has also examined the well-publicised cluster of leukaemia cases around the Dounreay nuclear plant and concludes it is likely to have been caused by exposure to incoming oil workers rather than radiation from the plantIn his reportpublished today in the British Medical JournalDr Kinlen writesThe findings support the infection hypothesis that population mixing can increase the incidence of childhood leukaemia in rural areasThey also suggest that the recent excess in the Dounreay-Thurso area is due to population mixing linked to the oil industryThe theory remains a controversial one but Dr Kinlen told The Scotsman that it is becoming harder to dismiss the findings as no more than chanceThe more studies that are done that come up with this same findingthe more difficult it is to dismiss themHe is now investigating if leukaemia cases rose in Orkney and Shetland due to wartime incomers and is also looking at the effects of large construction projects in Britain in the post-war periodSonar attempt to free sperm whalesCONSERVATIONISTS striving to free six sperm whales trapped in Orkney waters have been offered underwater sonar equipment in an attempt to lure the stricken mammals to safetyThey face a race against time as fears grow over the health of the whales and the possibility of their becoming beachedThe sperm whales have been stranded in Scapa Flow for several weeksRescuers have tried unsuccessfully to drive them out into the open sea using a line of boats with their engines runningEarlier this week Dr John Goold of Bangor University arrived on Orkney with a recording of female sperm whales from the AzoresIt has been decided to play the tape in an attempt to entice them out of the enclosed channelThere was concern that the hydrophonic amplification equipment needed for such a rescue operation was not availableYesterday howeverDavid Goodson of Loughborough University offered the team of biologistsnaturalists and conservationists a set of underwater transducers which he said should be able to produce the right effectMr Goodsonof the university's electronic engineering departmentsays he has offered the equipment free of chargeHe said the gearsimilar to that used for sub-surface profiling while looking for echoes during North Sea explorationis sitting unused in a laboratoryIt is high-powered and the tape should be audible to the whales from a distance of up to two milesMr Goodson said it would be necessary for the transducer to be coupled to a public address amplifierideally with a 100-line output transformerBasically what we are offering is an underwater loudspeakerIt can be hung over the side of a boat and the tape can then be played to the whalesHe acknowledged there was a problem transporting the heavybulky equipment from Loughborough to Orkney and recognised that time was of the essence if the whales

Marchthat researchers in Cambridge have produced genetically altered pigs with human heartsshows yet again that science is allowed to operate without any proper controlsHow much money has been spent and how many animals have suffered during the last eight yearsHow much more suffering and waste will there be before they move on to the human victims of their researchTime and again in the US we have seen people suffer long-drawn-out deaths plumbed into artificial heart machines or given the hearts of other species of primates in transplant operationsA great deal of medical opinion now recognises that preventive measures and wider availability of human organs for transplant are far more useful than animal experimentsOne would think that the present money-motivated Government would realise that encouraging people to carry donor cards and promoting a healthier lifestyle would give better resultsThere is one other aspect to genetically engineering animals to create human compatible tissue and organs which gives cause for concernIf the tissue and organs can be altered to make them acceptable for transplantwho can guarantee that animal diseases will not also adapt and cross the genetic barrierFresh Glasgow plea for extra health aid Eric McKenzie examines a report which lends weight to renewed requests to make the city a special case for actionSENIOR public health officials in Glasgow are adding weight to a renewed call by the district council for urgent Government action on health problemsThe link among bad health and povertydeprivation and unemployment was highlighted in a report by Glasgow's director of public healthDr George Forwellwhoalong with Dr Phil Hanlonhealth promotions officer with Greater Glasgow Health Boardwill discuss the report with members of the city's environment and health committee tomorrowJim McCarronthe committee chairmansaid yesterday that Dr Forwell's report underlined what politicians had been saying about Glasgow's health record for a long timeOur comments have gone unheeded by central government but surely they must pay attention now that they have been reiterated by a person of his standingGlasgow was a unique case and a powerful argument now existed to make it a special caseCastlemilk was made a special initiative area by the Government and major improvements to housing and the environment have taken placeBut Castlemilk only mirrors the problems in other parts of the city which must also be tackledIn the report Dr Forwell pointed out that half the population of Greater Glasgow lived in extremely disadvantaged conditionswith the health of adult men deteriorating markedly compared with the rest of ScotlandAn analysis of local government districts within the GGHB area showed that districts such as Bearsden and Milngavieand Eastwoodhad socio-economic and health indices as good as the best areas within EuropeHoweverGlasgow and Clydebank had levels of health comparable with many cities in what was once Eastern EuropeHis report added that unless there were a major and unexpected change in current trendsinequalities in health with Greater Glasgow and between Greater Glasgow and the rest of Scotland were likely to increaseDr Forwell said that marked differences among districts within the health board area suggested that there must be other determiners of health than just health servicesHe said he was not talking about more money for health services but about more money to enable the council to deal with problems such as condensation and proper insulation of housing in the cityMore money should be spentbut where they Glasgow District Councilget it from is a political matterHe addedThe natural environmentie the weatheris the same in Bearsden and Milngavie as in GlasgowI'm saying to Glasgow city council that I think the reason for the poor health of its people is due to factors outwith health services and more to do with social and economic factors such as unemployment and bad housingEast Kilbride opened a Health Yourself information service in the town's central libraryThe service includes health-related booksleafletsvideosand cassettes as part of a local health awareness campaign to promote a healthy life-styleOilseed rapeSome of your readers may have been confused by a report of our work in Aberdeen University on oilseed rape allergiesand subsequent letters from a farmer and an anti-allergy campaignerOur research is not completeand your report appears to have been based on a brief article in a farming journalWe have found no greater frequency of complaints of seasonal allergic-type symptoms in oilseed rape than in non-oilseed rape rural areasJust under 20 per cent of the populationhoweverin both areas complain of spring/summer symptoms and in the oilseed rape area a proportion attributed their symptoms to this cropIt seems likely thatin many casesthey are correctbut that these symptoms are not due to what doctors would normally regard as allergyThe word allergy means different things to different peoplefrom almost any unusual symptom to a specific and measurable form of immunological responseWe hope that our continuing work will shed light on these different conceptsand in due course we shall publish our results in medical journalsFor the momentit seems unlikely that oilseed rape causes more frequent or more dangerous symptoms to those living nearby than do many other cropsThis is not to say that it does not cause symptomswe think that it does in some peopleThere's a lot of it about A late-season flu bug has bitten Scotlandwrites Ian MullenTHE Scottish Football League programme has been badly affected over the last couple of weeksnot only by the injuries which might reasonably be expected at this stage in a crowded seasonbutunusuallyby a flu virus which has caused havoc in the playing staffs of some of the Premier Division teamsEleven Aberdeen players were laid low by the virusand Rangers lost their international goalkeeper Andy Goram to the bugWorst hit of all were Motherwellwho had 22 of their 32 registered players either injured or coughing and splutteringand who had their league game with Celtic postponed as a result of the infectionThis high incidence of viral infection is perhaps all the more surprising since there has not been a great deal of flu around this winter so farand many sufferers no doubt believed that they were going to escape altogetherInfluenza isof coursea completely different viral infection from the common coldand its effects are much more severeWhereas a cold may take a day or two to develop and produce a coughsore throat and streaming noseflu arrives much more suddenlyand also causes a high temperature and sore and aching joints and musclesMost sufferers will have to spend a day or two in bedand the feeling of malaise and depression with which the footballers are left will not necessarily be due to their team's position in the leaguebut is an almost inevitable element of a severe bout of fluThe incubation period of the virus is 24 to 48 hours and the infection is probably spread by droplets from the coughs and sneezes of those who are already sufferingAlthough they are extremely unlikely to suffer any lasting effects of the infectionit does appear to be the case that younghighly-trained athletessuch as footballersare often susceptible to viral diseasesThe only group at any real risk from a flu epidemic are the elderlyof which there are an increasing number these daysand the danger comes primarily from the development of secondary infections which can easily follow a dose of fluThe only really effective means of reducing the incidence of secondary infections in the elderly is by vaccinationusually done in autumnOnly
