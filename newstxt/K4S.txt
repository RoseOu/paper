The Northern EchoFORMER CBI chief Sir Terence Beckett claims North-East small businesses have a better chance of survival than their counterparts elsewhere in the countryWhat I have found in the region is that because it has experienced more downturns than other parts of the UK it has a resilience to the dips the economy may takehe saidBy contrasttalking to small and medium-sized businesses in the South-East I often find that they have only ever experienced one recession the current one and it can prove fatalHe also said the fall in the inflation rate announced yesterday would help add to the survival chances of small businessesSir Terence was talking while formally opening Teesside TEC's business growth centre in the TEC premises at Queen's Square in MiddlesbroughIt has been in operation since last monthgiving advice to around six established small and medium-sized businesses a dayThe centre is a splendid facility that allows the existing businessperson who wants to grow all the possible advice he or she may needsaid Sir TerenceTeesside TEC chief executive John Howell said the new centre aims to give help on three fronts business plansmarketing and technologyWe helped 500 businesses set up in Teesside last yearNow we are trying to target some of the 8,000 existing businesses who should be looking to use our facilitiesSo far only 200 have done sohe saidDole shockWith

payments should be made as an award for members who attendedBut Coun Michael CarrLabour leader of the councilsaid apart from some meetings held during the recess he was not aware of any

launched a scathing attack on the local authoritiesHe saidCharges made to OAPs will have been brought aboutnot because of greed or avarice of the local transport companiesbut because the local borough

councils blame tough spending limitsMr Winder said last nightBus companies do notand never havesubsidised OAP travelThey have a written agreement with local authorities that states reimbursement will be made in full by that authority to the company concerned for every OAP travelling free on its busesA pre-agreed percentage is deducted for those pensioners it is felt would not have travelled if the fare had not been freeMr Widmer said in recent yearsthe councils had failed to fully reimburse the bus companies in line with the agreementThe Caldaire debt went back to 1989he addedMr Widmer said the company could not afford these unpaid debts and claimed the 1,300 Caldaire employees were under threat because of the debtLangbaurgh council leader Arthur Taylor saidWe cannot speak for other

traffic problemshe saidMiddlesbrough and Cleveland Councils promised to improve access into the Enterprise Zoneand until they do tenants will go elsewhereMr Newman added the councils' policy of inaction is shortsighted as a recent survey carried out by property agent Drivers Jonas for English Estates shows that 32pc of all office property in Middlesbrough is situated in the Enterprise ZoneBut David Walshchairman of Cleveland County's economic development committeerebutted the criticismWe share the developer's concern and are aware of the problems of access onto the Enterprise

on with their lives and make a mental note to take night classes in the ridiculously complicated ticket systemAt parties occasionally we will recall the full horror of the event in one of those conversations which goes something likeYou were delayed six hours and then had to be diverted to a branch line 50 miles out of your way on a train that had no heating and no buffetThat's nothingyou should listen to thisThis mood of resignation was insufficient for John McArdleInstead of going home to forget he took BR to courthaving given them ample opportunity to avoid proceedingsand wonTalking about it yesterday the North-East solicitor urged other passengers to follow his exampleI feel we have the rail service we deserve if we're prepared to tolerate ithe saidIf enough people are prepared to do something about it then rudeness and inefficiency could be decreasedThose who had received poor servicehe saidcould consider their right of action and if necessary start proceedings in the Small Claims CourtThere a solicitor was not needed and legal costs would not be incurredThat is my message from the experience I hadhe saidPeople can do something about it themselves quite simplyI would urge them to do soThese were fairly strong words but Mr McArdleof Middleton St George had a fairly dismal experienceIt is the sort of thing that has happened to most of usHe and his wife were returning from a short break in Venice no problems with public transport or with the planeand arrived at King's Cross stationThey were bound for Darlington and clutched in their hands pre-paid APEX ticketsThey had reserved seats on the 2.30pm train but had been told by their travel agent that the 1.30pm train also took APEX travellersThe McArdles arrived at King's Cross minutes before the earlier train was about to leaveIt was almost emptythere was nobody around to check with and they duly boardedAs it happenedthey were not entitled to do soAs the train pulled out the senior conductor came roundHe noticed that their tickets were not eligible for the journeyHe agreed that they could disembark at Peterborough and wait for the 2.30pm trainThe ticket inspector then interrupted the conversation and said this was not possibleThe full excess fare had to be paidMeanwhilenobody was able to explain to Mr McArdle what the term Must use the servicemeant on the ticketHe had wrongly assumed he was able to use any APEX service as long as there was roomAs much put out by the ticket inspector's attitude as his demand for moneyhe paid and duly wrote to BR to complain saying he could see no justification in the circumstances for the excess chargeAfter four weeks he had received no replyHe wrote to remind BRA further month went by and he wrote another letter to threaten proceedingsA reply at last came which confused the senior conductor with the ticket inspector and said Mr McArdle had unilaterally reneged the conditions pertaining to the ticketsThe solicitor suedBR did not lodge a defence until it was too late and judgement had been madeHe was awarded the £40 he had been ordered to pay in excess fares plus interest plus costsHe has yet to receive his cheque but has received a letter from BR's legal department to say it is on its wayThe facts you have set out make a sorry tale indeedMr McArdle is aware that he has the advantage of being a lawyerBut legal expertise was not neededDetermination to fight for a principle wasAs for BR yesterdayits Press office said it was considered Mr McArdle had received an apology in the letter which arrived more than two months after his original complaintThe matter was now closedOn being asked if it would not have been appropriate to let the McArdles continue their journey on a largely empty train which after all permitted APEX tickets the spokesman saidOh noThere was no alternative but to do thatMr McArdle shouldn't have been on the trainIf we allowed it to happen once then all the people who read your paper would think they could do it as wellNot a word of additional apology or sympathy to the McArdlesmindTHE second round of the Government's City Challenge initiative was launched yesterday with a promise

inadequate by critics last nightNick PriceNorthern representative of the Federation of Housing AssociationssaidIt is certainly too littleAssociations require money and so do local authoritiesWe can't replace councilswe should be complementing themHe was speaking after the government funded Housing Corporation revealed plans to spend the money over the next 12 months on supporting schemes to build more than 2,000 homesThe project aims to ease the homelessness problem in the regionVictims of repossessions could also be helpedDermot Gleesoncorporation board membersaidThere is a greater awareness of the seriousness of the housing situation in the country as a whole and this investment will have a major impact on the region's housing problemsThe allocationwhich represents a 16pc increase on last yearis the highest amount spent in the North-East by the corporationMr Gleeson said it would be unfair to suggest the cash injection had something to do with the forthcoming General ElectionA survey by the corporation showed that homelessness was increasing because of unemploymentmortgage default and family break-upMore than 35pc of accommodation under the scheme will be set aside for the homelessBut a spokeswoman for Tyneside Housing Aidthe North-East representative for the campaign group SheltersaidWhichever way you look at itit is inadequateAny extra accommodation for the homeless is very welcomebut it has to be measured against the scale of the problemMiddlesbrough Council housing chairman Bob Brady welcomed its £12m allocation but warned there were no overnight solutionsto

Tyneside £4.7mHousing boost too littleTHE £94m which will be spent by the Government on new housing in the North-East over the next year is welcome newsIt will make a differencebut not muchThe scale of the problem is such that £94m could be spent in Middlesbrough alone and there would still be housing need in that townHomelessness has been on the increase for a long time and Government initiativesbased as they are on encouraging the private sector to fill the gap left by local authoritieshave been essentially piecemeal and fragmentaryThere are schemes here and there which are excellent but they simply don't address the magnitude of the crisisThe state of the country's finances doesn't allow this Governmentor its successorto wave a magic wand over the housing problem but there is more that could be doneA first step for this current administration would be to discard its ideologically-inspired opposition to council housing buildingWhile we would accept that some local authorities have a poor record for building and maintenance dating from ill-conceived schemes in the Sixties and Seventiessocial housing today has benefited from that experienceThere is no doubt that local authorities could build houses today that people would want to live inwould respect and protectIf they were unshackled from the current over-rigorous financial constraintsperhaps we could make a

Government cash for Middlesbrough's City Challenge plansMy ideas for rail freight hit the buffers full tiltA Bedale businessman tried and failed to bring more freight traffic to the limestone lineMr David Kerfoot said Railfreight International put nothing but problems in the way of his plan to bring raw materials by train from Germany to his vegetable oil factoryMr Kerfootmanaging director of Wensleydale Foods in the old station siding at Bedalechose road transport after his experiences with Railfreight nearly four years agoWensleydale Foods acquired the station site in 1985 after the public delivery siding had been closed and the short piece of track leading from the limestone branch had been liftedThe firm now employs 30 peopleexports about 20 per cent of its pro-duct and has an annual turnover of £10m. in various currenciesMr Kerfoot said this week that in 1988 one of his oil suppliers on the Rhine had been keen to send raw material to Britain by rail instead of road because of pressure from the German GovernmentUsing past experience with a company he worked for at TilburyEssexMr Kerfoot obtained quotes for the hire of special railway wagonsBut when it came to dealing with Railfreighthe saidhis ideas hit the buffersRailfreight said it could not justify moving the oil by rail to Bedale for economic and operational reasonsThe only option it could offersaid Mr Kerfootwas one involving transfer of the oil to road at sidings in Middlesbrough at about £35 a tonneMr Kerfoot saidNo one came to see us and the opportunity was lostILLOGICALInstead of a rate for carrying oil throughout to Bedale we just got a rate for bringing it to Middlesbrough for trans-shipment to roadwhich was illogical to meA man at Railfreight International was doing his best but someone along the line at York said it was too much hassleThe railway operating people put a massive number of problems in our wayand Railfreight's sales telex to us started with a mass of negativesWhat would any businessman do with a telex like thatRailfreight said thataccording to the operations department at Yorkthere were too many problems with the limestone train occu-pying the single line branch for about six hours every dayAn additional train had been introduced on Saturdays to meet British Steel's demand for more limestoneRailfreight said all the physical difficulties could be overcome with investmentbut all the options seemed to start at about £100,000Reinstating a siding at Bedale would involve a five-figure sumBritish Rail was prepared to invest only where returns were high and quickwhich was unlikely in Mr Kerfoot's caseGovernment grants were available in cases where rail would keep lorries off roads regarded as sensitiveRailfreighthoweversaid the Department of Transport was unlikely to regard Bedale as sufficiently sensitivebeing only a short distance from the A1Mr Kerfoot saidThe Channel Tunnel will open soon and we are de-investing in our railwaysnot re-in-vestingThe tunnel will create an opportunity not for BR but for foreign railwaysbecause they have an infrastructureHe addedI was staggered to learn that limestone was to go from Redmire to Redcar by road when we were told in 1988 that British Steel couldn't get enough of it and had put on an additional trainI think this is a decision based on a cost-cutting exerciseLike all commercial businesses British Steel must make a profit and times are hardbut this is cost cutting which is going to be detrimental to our communitySHARE tips from both the business staff at The Northern and Middlesbrough stockbroker Wise Speke are outperforming the 2.4pc increase in 1992 by the FTSE-100 indexThe Northern has made a £1,690 profit on its imaginary £10,000 portfolio in the first two months of the yearwhile Wise Speke has made £574The best performer in Wise Speke's half dozen to follow is Darlington-based engineering group which last week announced that 93.9pc of the recent rights issue had been taken up by shareholdersA rights issue is a means by which a company raises capital by offering new shares to existing shareholders at a fixed priceIn Whessoe's case they offered shareholders one new share for every four already held at a price of 185p to raise funds to purchase the Californian-based VarecThe success of the rights issue has underpinned the strong rise seen in the company's share price since the beginning of the year as analysts are positive on the long term benefits of the acquisition to the companyWise Speke analyst John DeansaysWhessoe and Varec have been known to one another for some considerable time although given their emphasis on different geographical markets they have rarely found themselves in direct competitionHaving already been through some significant change the company is therefore well placed to face the likely upheavalof the following year or soSo far the personnel at Varec appear positive about their new owners and the signs are encouraging that Whessoe will get through this next important stage with full supportWise Speke is quietly confident that Whessoe has made a good deal for its longer term developmentALL 32

debtsA bus company is to sue three Cleveland boroughs over what it claims is almost £800,000 worth of unpaid debtsMr Mike Widmermanaging director of Caldair which owns UnitedTeesside Motor Services and Tees and District Busesclaims the debts date back to 1989 and are a result of the concessionary fares schemeHe warned this week that the concessions for local pensioners would end if not this year then certainly next yearHe said bus companies had written agreements with local authoritiessaying the councils would fully reimburse them for pensioners' travel concessionsOver the last three years StocktonMiddlesbrough and Langbaurgh councils had failed to pay upCaldaire was owed about £800,000He said the firm could not afford to ignore such losses as they could put the jobs of 1,300 employees in jeopardyHis statement continuedCaldaire appreciates that monetary problems and not bloody-mindedness are the cause of the problembut financial hardship never has been justification for non-payment of debtThe councils themselves emphasise this when chasing offenders for non-payment of poll taxHe said it seemed inevitable that free travel for pensioners in Cleveland would have to endCoun. Arthur Taylorleader of Langbaurgh councilsaidWe have no debt with CaldaireMr Bob Pattersontreasurer of Stockton councilsaidWe set aside a certain sum each year for concessionary fares which we then share out among the bus companiesI don't accept we owe the bus companies anythingCoun. Mike Carrleader of Middlesbrough councilcalled for a return to reasoned debateon the subjectHe said that last year the local authority spent £1.35m. on concessionary fares and would spend the same this yearThe problem lay with the Government for consistently underfunding local government spendingThe subject of travel concessions has been a controversial one for the last few monthsAll three councils have considered scrapping them to cut their spending in line with Government guidelinesOn Friday last week a fourth petition this time bearing 1,039 signatures protesting against the possible loss of free bus passes was presented to Langbaurgh councilLangbaurgh and Stockton are both considering either scrapping free passes or asking pensioners to contribute towards themMiddlesbrough

Teessideto Shiptonnear York to take electricity from a new power station on Teesside to the south of EnglandA National Grid spokesman yesterday confirmed negotiations had been going on with landowners but he said it was perfectly normal procedureThe National Grid does not own the land on which the pylons are to be built and it has to negotiate some form of agreement with the landownerhe saidThese negotiations are fairly typical and there is nothing unusual about the arrangementHe said he could not release details of the amount of money involved as it was confidential informationAs far as we are concerned it would not be proper to give the actual amountsbut these negotiations are useful for maintaining contact with the landownerMike Barrfrom the Borrowby Pylon Action GroupsaidThis is

Picton and ShiptonSolicitor David Parrishrepresenting North Yorkshire County CouncilsaidIt is most unusual to attend a public inquiry to find an application with three alternative proposalsIt is unfair on objectorsand encourages a not in my backyardapproachIf there is a road scheme proposal from the Department of Transport and a local authoritythey must choose a preferred route to which objectors can make representationsIf the Secretary of State asks the NGC to state their preferred routeit could save the inquiry a lot of time and moneyBut George BartlettQCfor the NGCsaidThe inquiry's time and cost would not be savedbecause whether or not we express a preference for one of themthey will remain as alternatives before the secretary of StateIt is not uncommon when seeking consent for an overhead line to put forward proposals in the alternativeIt's the fairest way of ensuring that those affected by each route are able to what the case for and against that route isThe inquiry will have two inspectorschartered surveyor Trevor Grahamrepresenting the Department of the Environmentand chartered engineer John Lindsayrepresenting the Department of EnergyMr Graham confirmed it was in order for the NGC to offer alternative routes for the inquiry's considerationHe addedWe may decide that all are acceptablethat none are acceptablethat some are acceptable and others notor that some would only be acceptable with minor modificationsThe issues to be considered by the inquiry will include whether the scheme is needed at allwhat its visual impact would behealth and safety mattersits affect on local amenitiesits impact on agricultureroad transportaviationradio and TV receptionwhether it would create extra noiseand whether it would conflict with existing

short-changed £800,000 by the Government and that has inevitably had an effect on the level of the chargeThis is financial sleight of hand of the worst sorttypical of the spivs currently running our economyIn effectit makes the Government the biggest non-payer of poll tax of all and they must act to remedy this situationHe said the biggest element in the rise from last year's £309 was the Government's withdrawal of the safety netwhich adds £14.87 to each billThe figure included for non-payment £28.04 is 50p up on last yearCoun Carr said only an estimated £83.29 of the £353 was for

the selling methods of a double glazing company on the day its Middlesbrough office manager and senior staff were sackedSure Style acted after a rash of complaints about salesmen terrorising potential customersrefusing to leave their homes until they had agreed to buy double glazingComplaints have led to an inquiry by the Office of Fair TradingBut as the Sure Style axe fellone of its salesmen continued his pitch while a retired dockerEdward Donnellyplugged himself into a lung machine for vital treatmentThe salesmen only left at 1.15am after 74-year-old Mr Donnelly and his wife Winnie67had been battered into submission by seven hours of hard sellMrs Donnelly saidI explained I did not want to buy any windowsbut the salesman said he just wanted to show us what was on offer so I let him inFirst he asked to go to the toiletThen he came back and asked for a cup of teaHe sat on the sofa with tea and biscuits and asked if he could watch Coronation StreetI was so taken aback I didn't say anythingDespite the elderly couple repeatedly telling salesmen Eric Stewart that they didn't want any windows he continued his talk and demonstration until 11pmThen there was a knock on the door of their home in Darenth CrescentMiddlesbroughCleveland and another salesman appearedMr Stewart invited him in so he must have been expecting himsaid Mrs DonnellyMr Donnelly underwent emergency coronary care treatment in hospital last yearHe was allowed home but needs to use a nebuliser six times a day to get drugs and oxygen to his lungsThe salesmen could see the oxygen cylinder in the hallAt about 11pm we explained my husband would have to go on his nebuliser but they just continuedMy husband put his mask on and we plugged him in and the salesmen just kept shuffling papersAt 1.15am nearly seven hours after the first salesman arrived Mrs Donnelly finally agreed to buy a windowMrs Donnelly agreed to buy £800 of double glazingShe said the salesmen refused to take a cheque so she handed over £30 deposit and the salesmen leftAnd yesterday Darlington bus inspector Malcolm Humble told how a Sure Style salesman put him through a five-hour ordeal before threatening to send him a bill for his

didn't think he'd be here five hours latersaid Mr HumbleI kept asking him to just leave me a quoteI'm not the type of person to tell him straight out to goAt one stage the rep left the house to make a phone callleaving his equipment behindHe returnedsaying he had arranged for his boss to telephone 54-year-old Mr Humble at 6pmHe rang me and offered me a door for £250I jumped at the chancesaid Mr HumbleBut when we got down to signing the papers I saw there was £198 charged for the fittings and £223 VAT on the original sum I had been quotedThere was no way I was going to go for thatIn the end he tore up the agreement in front of meBut on his way out he said we were stupid to think we would get a door for £250He even threatened to send me a bill for his timeYesterday company spokesman

Britain's only potash mine at Boulby near Staithes are expecting a boost in their pay packetsAfter a two-year freeze on wage risesmanagement at Cleveland Potash have agreed a five per cent increase for the 956 employeesbackdated to January 1A mild winter has led to a drop off in sales of salt to local authorities and there has also been a reduction in the market for potash in Britain as a result of the uncertain future in farmingHoweverthe company is still hauling 750,000 tonnes of potash each year from seams deep under the North Sea and is building up an increasing export marketAbout half that figure is shipped to Western Europemainly SpainPortugalFrance and FinlandAlmost all of it is exported through Tees Dock at Middlesbroughbut some is also sent from WhitbyThe potash mine is by far the biggest employer in the Whitby and Loftus areas and all local authorities have been considerate in their handling of problems caused by it being on the edge of a national parkMonitoring of lorries going through nearby villages takes place at frequent intervals and there are repeated calls for more potash to be transported by trainHoweverwhen that happened there were protests from people living near the line in parts of East ClevelandSOLICITORS in parts of the North-East started industrial action yesterday in protest at proposed changes to the legal aid systemMembers of the Darlington duty solicitors scheme unanimously decided to suspend all court and 24-hour duty until April 3They say their action is a protest at the Government's proposals for fixed fees in legal aid cases and the 3pc increase in legal aid feesA statement issued by the group saidMembers of the scheme are aware that this action may cause inconvenience and possibly hardship but the decision was taken after careful considerationIt was felt that the Government's proposals could only lead to inadequate funding which would inevitably force many practitioners to leave duty solicitor schemes and indeed the criminal practice permanentlySolicitors also fear the changes could reduce public access to legal aid and increase the likelihood of a miscarriage of justiceUnder the changes solicitors will receive a flat rate for each legal aid case rather than for the amount of time spent on individual casesSolicitors on Teesside took similar action yesterday and it is believed it could spread to North Yorkshire and Bishop AucklandLast year the Automobile Association took over operation of the schemewhich puts police in touch with local duty solicitorsBut the scheme ran into difficulties in the beginning and was criticised for sending solicitors to police stations miles away from their areaMr Hunsley said it was now up to the AA to find other duty solicitorsLawyers in Teesside withdrew their duty solicitor cover from 6pm last nightNormally there would have been two solicitors covering police stations at StocktonMiddlesbroughThornabySouth BankRedcar and GuisboroughThere will also be no court duty

shipyardthe home for a Yorkshire Water Authority sewage worksHe shakes his head in disbeliefWith a lot of will we could still be building ships theresaid 57-year-old Hughiewho has seen the Whitby shipbuilding industry decline so much that there are now just two people making traditional Yorkshire coblesHughie's hopes were raised last year when it was suggested that a replica of one of Captain Cook's shipseither Endeavour or Resolutionshould be built in Indonesia and brought back to Whitby as a permanent reminder of the feats of the town's most famous son of the seaWhen Hughie was picked as the person to head the project he just about had his suitcases packed for SarawakBut the idea was eventually sunk when Scarborough Council did not back the ideawhich was designed to give the shipyard a new lease of lifeHughie saidYou can say that shipbuilding in Whitby has gone down the sewerIt's a sad day the end of a traditionNow he has to content himself with the fact that the only replica of a Captain Cook ship he has been involved in was one built for the new shopping centre in Middlesbrough eight years agoIt is a one-fifth scale model of Endeavourbuilt using traditional methodsbut also allowing for modern safety requirementsCook set sail on ships constructed in the old Fishburn shipyardjust at the bottom of Hughie's front gardenPlans for the shipyard do not include a heritage centre

WhitbyYorkshire Water has calculated that at the busiest time August Bank Holiday it could have 50,000 people using itTHE establishment of a £11m nature reserve on Teesside is evidence that the Government's development corporations do have more than the interests of big business at heartSometimes justifiably criticised for their apparent aloofness from local issuesthe two North-East corporations have had to work hard to convince the doubters of their worth to the wider communitySome remain unconvincedPaul Harfordthe leader of Cleveland County Councilyesterday wondered whether the investment was justified while his authority was starved of cash for hundreds of worthwhile projectsSadly for Mr Harfordthe £11m would never have been given to the Labour county council by this

derived from turning 2,500 acres of wasteland into the country's biggest man-made nature reserveThis is an amenity that all Teessiders and others from further afield will be able to enjoy for generationsThe reserve forms part of the Teesside Development Corporation's strategy to greenthe area in order to make it more attractive to outside investorsIn the crucial aspect of image-buildingthe

Works means very little in Darlington todaybut in its brief and eventful lifeit created a worldwide reputationThe company was formed on Albert Hill in 1864 and by the time it closed in 1879 it had been responsible for 40 bridges in Denmark20 bridges in Sweden all built in 1874all the viaducts on the Whitby-RedcarMiddlesbrough line including the Staithes ViaductLlandudno piera bridge in Syriaanother over the Tay in Scotland and a footbridge over the Tees at Barnard CastleIts biggest project was the Leith Docks swing-bridge over the River Liffey in Dublin in 1879but despite the contract being worth £8,143when the bridge first swung open Skerne Iron Works' finances were swaying perilouslyUp on Albert Hill in all likelihood its operations were on the banks of the eponymous river where the Cleveland Industrial Estate is now it had a massive and profitable operation covering 22 acresemploying 1,000 men and boys and working 90 furnacesThe real problem was the Britannia Works in Middlesbrough which Skerne acquired after leading partner Walter Pease died in 1872His death meant a shortage of capitalThe other partnersEdward Hutchinsona solicitor who married industrial magnate Sir David Dale's daughterand R L Prattdecided to float the company on the stock marketTheir prospectus said Skerne was thinking of extending further into the bridge-building fieldand £200,000 was secured by the sale of 10,000 £20 sharesWith 120 furnaces and its own wharf on the Teesthe Britannia site no doubt looked impressivebut the 1870s were the wrong time for businesses to try to expandBritain was in the grip of a severe recession and by 1875 the Britannia Works were forced to close at an enormous loss which Albert Hill could not sustainThe recession deepened as the 1870s proceededand by 1879 Skerne Iron Works had called in the liquidatorBut there is a glimmer of brightness in the Skerne storyA group of former employees made redundant as the Albert Hill site wound down in 1877 clubbed together and formed Cleveland Bridge and Engineering CompanyA little-known Darlington firm might also have been active in this early phaseThere is a belief but open to much doubt that the bridge builder Teasdale supplied various canal spans for the pedestrian traffic across the River Jumnaa major tributary of the GangesThat this firm existed is confirmed by their name being

to one of the region's planning expertsChris Checkley of property agent Sanderson Townend & Gilbert claims thousands of businesses in the region can gain financial help with projectsbut they need to act quicklyAn April 22 deadline has been imposed by central Government for local authorities to submit their City Challenge bidsNearly £38m is on offerto be divided up over five yearsThe winning areas will get the cash for projects such as improving company buildings and road access arrangementscar parkingand landscapingThe Government is particularly keen that the money should be spent on partnership schemes for development and improvement involving the private sectorsaid Mr CheckleyAnd if more companies apply to their local authority for grant cash it could sway the Government's decision to award the City Challenge moneyAny businesses or land owners with interests in the City Challenge Initiative bid should give urgent consideration to this matter over the next few days to

puzzle last yearWhen is a rental level not a rental levelthey askedAnswering their own question they repliedAlmost alwaysIt has been remarkablebearing in mind the massive oversupply of office and retail spacethat we have continued to hear of unexpectedly high rents being achievedsaid the analystsBut behind the headline numbers lurked the truthdisguised in a veil of what the property market calls confidentiality clauses and what others call secret dealsProperty dealsunlike those in the stock market have no transparencyif requiredNot only are they not transparenta property deal can be struck subject to just about anythingsaid UBSMore bluntly theyand many in the marketwere objecting to the prices paid by tenants to landlords for their shop units and offices being kept secret from the marketSecret sales of property were also subject to the same lambastingThe objection is that secrecy makes it very difficult to assess the value of a deal and therefore to judge the true state of the marketMore worryinglyconfidentially clauses are being used to falsely maintain capital valuesAnd when rent reviews are due it can be almost impossible to assess what tenants should be payingUnfortunately most agents are more than willing to bow to pressure from landlords and tenants who insist that confidentiality clauses are inserted into any dealno matter how smallAs an examplethe property agent Sanderson Townend & Gilbert in Newcastle recently sent out details to the press of a regional lettingThe agent said it had sold a commercial garage in Middlesbrough to a named companyAside from its geographical location and the name of the other agent involved few other details were includedCertainly not price or purchaserPaul Stevenson of the agent saidThe buyer did not want its identity revealingMaybe notBut the bald statement that a garage has been sold in Middlesbrough is neither a news storynor of any help to agents working in the market who need to know such detailsTo those operating in the specialist property press such lack of detail is intolerableTrade magazine Estates Times will not print the details of deals unless the property's addresssizerent or price involved and size of any premium paid are includedAnd in a recent hard-hitting editorial its editor Lee Mallett saidWhat is most disconcertingis the apparent unwillingnessof leading figures in the property industry to acknowledge the distortions that are arising because of the suppression of informationCreditably a handful of influential figures are speaking out against the cult of confidentialityMost notable amongst these is John Ritblatthe urbane chairman of developer British LandHe has called for the compulsory registration of all property transactions in an attempt to stop the use of secret dealsIn a newsletter published by his agency Conrad Ritblatt he saidWe must move towards compulsory registration of investment dealslettingsmortgages and all transactions in landRitblat would like to see all such information logged with the Land RegistryThose who scoff that this cannot be done should look to the United StatesIn their most liquid markets New York and Los Angelesfor instance the Real Estate Data Inc publication will give you comprehensive details of ownershipvalues and rents on a street-by-street basisThe eponymous retail agent Clive Lewis has also added his voice to Ritblat'sIn his midsummer retail report last year he said confidentiality clauses were falsely conceived protectionismSuch clauses succeed in frustrating the free flow of information so essential for accurate valuation at reviewHis report also noted that in order to obtain information some valuers have subpoenaed surveyors bound by confidentiality clauses to appear in arbitration hearingsEqually notable figures will spring to the defence of the secret dealhoweverJohn Parrymanaging director of developer Hammersonwas reported as sayingIf a landlord or tenant wants a deal to be confidentialthen they should be allowed toIt is an integral part of British lawA lot of tenants don't want their competitors to know their cost baseparticularly retailersThe clauses probably have been misused or overused as a toolThe trouble is you don't know where to draw the lineBut UBS doesWe are aware that part of a substantial City office building was recently announced as having been let at £40 per sq ftsaid the property analystsThere was the ubiquitous confidentiality clause which we understand was to hide a two year rent free periodBroken back over the five years to the first rent reviewthe true rent equates to just £24 per sq ft 40pc less than actually reportedThis lead the analysts to estimate that all reported headline deals are probably around 10 to 20pc above the true marketThe property market should be following UBS's lead and saying deals reported at up to 20pc above their true value is precisely where to draw the lineTHE weekly market on a

Liberal Democrat candidate Ian Cameron described the manifesto as sketchy and addedWhere is the money going to come from and what good is it going to doAnd Graham RobbConservative candidate for Hartlepool was equally criticalHe saidThis is all beautifully rosy but he has not mentioned his plans to tax companies by half a per cent on the payroll for a training tax or plans to enforce a

inquiry in 1990INVESTORS and the City have watched spellbound as MTM's share price has continued to fall in value over the past weekThe beleaguered Hutton Rudby-based company closed on Friday down 2p on the day at 74pThe fall was of special interest to The Northern Echo's business staffAt the beginning of the year we invested a notional £2,000 in the companyThat £2,000 is now worth just £609just 29pc of its original valueThe Echo's total £10,000 investment is now in the red at £9,712But its challenger in the share raceMiddlesbrough stockbroker Wise Speke has also suffered as the market takes cover during the current bout of election feverIts original £2,000 investment is now worth £8,463Although MTM's shares rallied at the start of last week the publication by UBS Philips & Drew of an in-depth report on the state of the company's finances started them on a downward slide againThe bad news from the analysts was compounded by the acknowledgement from the new board that the already twice-cancelled figures for 1991 will not be presented until at least mid-AprilThe consensus in the markets is that the newly-formed audit committeemade up of board membersis examining more than last years figuresThe prospects for a rally in the shares now depends on a bid for the whole MTM operationgiving the shares some added value and stopping the downward trendThis is not an investment for the faint-heartedFor the bold puntera bid above 100p is unlikely without some signs of positive management action to stabilise cash flowThat is what the City and investors are watching forA PLAN to build

former Middlesbrough chief scout came to Feethams in May 1989during the reign of far-sighted Brian Littleand with no real basis to work onThe transformation has been incrediblewith a real flow of talent coming throughGeldart saysWhen I arrivedthere was only one schoolboy on the staffand six YTS lads with no team to play inThey were virtually left to fend for themselvesandsadlythey had no chance to make an impactWe had to let them goHe hesitatesand waves a hand at the board on the wall behind himOn it are written the details of over 30 schoolboy and YTS playersall signed by the Quakers with a chance of making the gradeWe have 17 schoolboys signed on nowand there will be a further intake of 13 YTS lads during the summerWe're always out and about watching gamesI've got several people helping me all over the areaand I watch three or four games on a Sunday myselfAs well as those on the boardGeldart picks up a thick wad of letters from boys who will be invited to the club's Centre of Excellencewhich takes place over two sessions every Thursday nightThere are 20 kids to a sessionwith each course lasting four weeksA lad has a week to settle inthen another three weeks to show us what he can doParents and teachers can write to meand tell me about their kidsWe will take a look at themWhatever happensthey will enjoy themselvesThis yearfive boys two under 12s and three under 13s are going for training with the County FA regional squadand for a club this sizeit's brilliantWe've got a conveyor belt of talent coming through nowWe have an under 16 side in the Yorkshire Conference on a Sunday morningand I reckon three lads in there are going all the wayThey've already played in the Northern Intermediate League for under 19sand they haven't left school yetAs well as those two teamswe can play friendlies at any levelfrom under tens onwardsWe are on a par with anyone in the North-EastEven though Darlington is a small clubthis is still a prolific area for producing talentand even after the big clubs have had their pickthere is still enough for usOur Centre of Excellence on Thursday nights for boys from ten to 14 helps us to competeThey get first-class coachingAll the first team players help out on Tuesdays and Thursdaysand we have specialist coaches coming inThe biggest thing we can offer them is early progressFifteen-year-olds are playing against lads a year olderthe under 16s play in the under 19swhile some of the 17-year-olds have been playing in the Midland League for our reservesAs everyone knows nowlads like Sean Gregan are playing in the first team

CarnellTheir education is taken care of at Longlands College one day a weekThey can take lessons of their own choosingand some lads are aiming for degreesThere is a definite path to the first team for these kidsThere were three of them in the first team at Peterborough last Saturdayand on Tuesday night young Adam Reed was in the squadThere is no better place to come to than FeethamsAnyone who wants to play football and reach the Football League has an ideal chance hereWith our financial positionit's a necessity for the club to have good young players coming throughIf they have what it takesthen they will get their chance earlyLads like GreganSunley and Isaacs are all putting themselves in the shop windowand some day a big club will come and get themThe senior dressing room is getting youngerand the average age is down to 21These kids will save the club a fortune eventuallyGeldart drools with enthusiasm when he speaks of some of the players who have broken into the first team or are on the vergeYoung Gregan can go all the wayHe's a midfield player reallybecause he is very good on the balland he can't express himself at centre halfI can see him playing an anchor role in midfieldMark Sunley is anotherI signed him for Middlesbroughand I jumped at the chance to sign him again hereHe loves to attack the balland is happier in the centre of defence instead of at full backThose two Darlington fans know aboutbut there are manymany moreAdam Reed will turn out to be another GreganHe has come on tremendouslyand is still only 16Jimmy Montgomery comes in one day a week to coach the goalkeepersand he raves about young Adrian SwanHe says he is the best young goalkeeper by far in all the North-East clubsThere are more Matthew ScollettRichard Cooper and Simon ShawAll unknowns to the fansbut perhaps not for much longerPeople should come and see the progress the club has made at Hundens Lane on Saturdays or at Rothmans on SundaysBut apart from a supply of talentGeldart also needs hard cashWe need a sponsor to help with travel expenses and the likeIt would be great to take the lads to international tournamentsbecause playing against foreign teams brings them on no endThey learn quicklyand they bond togetherAnybody who wants to help out that way can come along and see the kids for themselvesThey won't be disappointedManager Ray Hankinmeanwhileis

North-East watching matchesmarking pitches and putting nets upentirely voluntary the only payment they get is a match ticketThings are really beginning to roll nowand I've never been so happyAnd the results are there to seeLads in the first teamwhile the kids are drawing at places like Sheffield WednesdayLeeds and SunderlandThat shouldn't happenbut it isThe youth policy is now firmly on the

MiddlesbroughMore than 200 jobs could be created by the developmentwhich is about half the size of the Co-Op's Somerville Hypermarket at StocktonBut Cleveland County Council's development chairman

Hypermarket is already trading successfully in Stockton and we hope to be able to offer the same quality of goods and standards of service to the people of MiddlesbroughCoun Walsh saidObviouslywe will have to examine the proposals in detailbut I have to say that there will inevitably be serious questions to be askedThe Co-Op proposals could run contrary to the structure plan because of the likely impact on existing shops at MartonCoulby NewhamMiddles-brough itself and possibly even Great AytonIt has to be pointed out that the consequences of the Co-Op's last development in the county was the closure of their Stockton High Street storeAlsoa development as large as the one proposed would generate a very substantial amount of traffic and we would have to examine in great detail the implications for roads in the areaWe are always anxious to encourage new developments and new jobs to Clevelandbut any project has to be judged on its potential impact on existing shops and jobs and

given or subsequently brokenthe firm could be taken to courtMr Robinson said he appreciated the OFT had a lot to do and claimed it would be more appropriate if trading standards officers could ask for

Birmingham-based DowdingChairman Peter Hollings still insisted yesterday its £18.3m bid last year was generous and in the best interests of both companies' shareholdersHe said the offer was based on industrial logicTwo-thirds of Tyneside-based T&C shareholders rejected the bid offer last NovemberThe failure of the bid followed two months of bitter rivalryclaims and counter-claims between executives of both groupsT&C also paid a high price for victoryA month ago its chairman Paul Tordaya former Northern CBI chairmandisclosed that the cost of its defence amounted to £653,000That means the abortive bid ate into combined profits to a total of £1.285mMr Hollings confirmed that Dowding was holding on to its 8.7pc stake in T&Cbuilt up in the run-up to and during the launch of the takeover bidHe made his comments as the company announced a fall in pretax profits for the six months to December 31 of £3.6mfrom £5.1mSales fell 7pc to £38mDowding has operations in PeterleeDurham

of funding available to TECsparticularly for adult trainingAs a resultTECs generally had to make cuts in the number of providers of employment training at a time when there was a growing need for such
