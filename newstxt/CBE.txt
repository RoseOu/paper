after the fourth anniversary of the Lockerbie bomb allegedly planted by two Libyans which killed 270The Lockerbie flight number was 103The Libyan internal flight from Benghazi to Tripoli was 1103Officials are investigating Tripoli residents' reports that the airliner hit a military planeDr Jim Swireof the Lockerbie Action Group UK Families Flight 103saidThe coincidence of the two flight numbers and the anniversary is a bit sinister and I find it hard to believe there is no connectionIn the last four years we have been asked to believe too many coincidencesIt is certainly very strange but we will have to wait for the outcome of an investigationThe Foreign Office was last night checking if any British workers were among the deadThe plane was due to connect with the hydrofoil service to Malta which is used by British oil workersBritons are advised not to use Libyan internal flights because sanctions against export of aviation parts to the country make planes unsafe and uninsurableBut a British diplomat said there were passengers who ignored the warningsDr Swirewhose daughter Flora was among the Lockerbie deadsaidAt the very least I think the Libyans will blame the sanctions imposed after Lockerbie for the crashBut I hope they will allow independent investigators access to the inquiryDr Swire is still campaigning for a public inquiry into LockerbieHe claims security loopholes which allowed terrorists to plant the bomb are still openBritish women on Faro crash flightA BRITISH woman and her two daughters were last night believed to be among the victims of

copper piping installed during the statue's centenary in 1986 to syphon off rainwateras well as the stainless steel vacuum cleaning system needed to keep the interior spotlessMario also maintains the drainage system behind the two toilets in the statue itselfplus the one at its footthat cater for about 1.8 million visitors every yearIt's not the sort of work Super Mario has ever had to dobut I feel a little more patriotic about this than any of my other jobshe saysConsidering the Statue of Liberty has been a beacon of hope for generations of newly-arrived immigrantsit's appropriate that Mario arrived in New York with his parents 30 years agoNow 43he's a few years older than Super Mario who made his screen debut in a 1980 arcade gameLike Super Marioour Mario's family is Italian but he was born in Croatia and now worries about his homeland's problemsI used to go back there on holidaybut it's not the sort of place you'd want to visit nowhe saysI have friends over there and keep in

frequently be found hunting in upstate New York at weekendsSuper Mario exists on a sole diet of mushroomswhich he gobbles up during the gamebut Mario's favourite food is pastaHeycooking is one of my great lovesand naturally that means ItalianNintendo claims that 50 per cent of British households now own one of their gamesand research shows that the little man on the Game Boy screen is recognised by more children in America than Mickey Mouse isThis success is even more surprising as Super Mario hardly conforms to the traditional image of the American superheroJapanese computer genius Shigeru Miyamoto based the character of Super Mario on the caretaker at Nintendo's first offices in New YorkHe explainsHe is a kind of Everymanwho rises to heroism in the face of adversity and whose insignificance makes him appealingMario Zupanovic hasn't had anyone stopping him in the street for autographs yetBut that may change with the release of the £22 million Super Mario film next summerI

sooner rather than laterEven though the Ministry of Defence has already drawn up plans to pull Britain's 2,400 troops out of the danger zone swiftlythey could find themselves caught in the crossfire very quicklyFor the first timeUN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali last night issued an ultimatum to the Serbian warlordsLet us give one more chance to the peace processhe saidIt was a clear signal that if talks failedthe UN would pass a resolution next week allowing world forces to shoot down Serbian planesA full-scale attack would then only be weeks away if American and other jets enforce the no-fly zoneHumanitarian aid would have to be halted if an attack was sanctionedMr Boutros-Ghali addedPresident George Bush bluntly warned Serbia yesterday that America would launch air strikes against them if the war spreadsForeign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday paved the way for British involvement in the conflictHe said he did not want to involve British troops and planes in actionbut admitted for the first time that it was a possibilityThe Serbs should note a changehe saidMr Hurd said he opposed military actionbut conceded the time had come where he could imagine armed action against Serbia to prevent a general Balkan warThis means using soldiers and air power to stop military attacks in Macedonia and Kosovoareas south of SerbiaMany ministers and senior civil

pushing the West towards military action was supported by other partiesShadow foreign minister George Robertson saidWe are right to maintain pressure on Serbia and we must do so increasingly through sanctionsIt would be wrong to rule out military action for all timeThe priority at the moment is the safety of the UN troops on the ground and being wary of the dangers of long-term military

brightest thing in the life of widower Bob MaysThe girl Bob thought was his daughter had become more and more precious to him since the death of his wife BarbaraTheir happiness was to be destroyed by the heart-rending realisation that Kimberly was not his childShe had been swopped with another baby 13 years before in a tragic hospital blunderBob Mays had to confront the fact that for years he had been loving someone else's daughterThe story of Bob and Kimberly captures the emotional torture of families across America whose lives have been blighted by baby swopsIt began in the Hardee Memorial HospitalWauchulaFlorida with Kimberly's birthWhether on purpose or by mistakeKimberly was exchanged for the baby who came to be known as Arlena TwiggThe swop did not come to light until Arlenawho suffered from a congenital heart defecthad to undergo surgeryBlood tests revealed that she was not the Twiggs' natural childThe Twiggs hired a private investigator to find their real daughterIt didn't take long to track down KimberlyFor Kim and her widowed father Bobthe sudden intrusion into their specially close lives was shatteringBob's wife Barbara had died of cancer when Kim was two and she was the only thing left in Bob's lifeThe Twiggswho have seven other children aged from eight to 23have never made any apolgies for turning their lives upside downOnce we knew we had a daughter someplace out therewhat could we do but try to find herthey saidBut the Twiggs have done much more than thatThey have broken a court-made promise to Bob Mays that if he would agree to testing to prove whose child Kim wasthey would not seek custodyTerrified of losing his only childmindful of Kim's sobbing pleas not to leave herBob had fought off earlier legal actions to win his co-operationHe saidMy stand was that even if Kimberly was their biological daughterwas it right to put her through thisThis time he agreedconfident that the Twiggs would stick to their part of the bargainI wanted them to understand that there was no way they were going to get Kimhe saidFor the Twigg's undertaking came as enormous reliefShe saidI felt better when Dad told me there was no chance I was going to have to go live themBut the blood tests brought a double blow to the Kimberly and BobFirstthey proved she was the biological child of the TwiggsTheir close relationship could cope with thatbut worse was to comeAfter a series of tense bitter-sweet meetings between the two families and hours of probing by child psychiatristsvisitation rights for the Twiggs were establishedBut the onc-a-month get togethers with her new family took a terrible toll on KimAlthough early on she sheepishly confessed to enjoying the visitsshe didn't like the way the Twiggs expected her to call them Mom and DadKim's good grades in school plummetedShe became moody and unhappyjust like Bob who was having to cope with sharing KimNow the Twiggs are now demanding custody and Kimberly's heartbreaking story probably won't end until the Supreme Court has had its sayThe court ruled this week on the case of Pauls and Moores of GeorgiaIt ordered Jodie Paul to give back her four-year-old biological son Melvin to Eugene and Edith Moorethe couple who adopted him and raised him since birthFor all the victims of baby swops the details my be different but the anguish is just the sameLast night Britain's leading childbirth

holiday without ageneral mayhem breaking out and blosing wee KevinThisas you may have guessedis the phenomenally successful Home Alone formula and all characters are firmly in situ for the sequel which opens in Britain on FridayKevinalias Macaulay Culkinthis time runs riot through New York's high life and low lifeIn his wake is left a highly-professional movie with some excellent knockabout acting and a level of pace and tension which exceeds the breakneck delights of its predecessorMacaulay has certainly grown in acting stature if not in heightThis is an alarmingly grown-up piece of acting from such a small boy and it is obvious why he is paid so much money to do itThe mayhem begins with the McCallister family en route to Miamiwith the flurry of misplaced ticketsthe argumentative large brood of children and general panic from motherCatherine O'Haraand bemused confusion from fatherJohn HeardMacaulay gets on the wrong plane and ends up in the Big Apple where he books into the palatial Plaza Hotelmuch to the suspicion of various flunkies including a camp Tim CurryMeanwhileJoe Pesci and Daniel Sternas good old burglars Harry and Marvhave just escaped from prisonThey plan to rob a toy store on Christmas Eve and just happen to bounce up against Macaulay in a busy New York streetThe movie firmly puts its hands up and admits this is a retread of Home Alone 1 by constant references to the last time the McCallisters lost KevinHoweverthis time director Chris Columbus show us everything from Macaulay's perspectiveThe surrounding characters including Brenda Fricker as a lonely bag lady with a pigeon fetish are merely incidentals to help flesh out his roleThere is one aspect to Home Alone 2 which calls into question its appeal as a children's movieWhen Macaulay holes up in his uncle's deserted househe treats Pesci and Stern to a cartoon-like sadistic onslaught which goes way beyond what was served up in Home Alone 1It made me cringe at its over-the-top violenceBut Macaulay has a charisma that attracts pre-pubescents like fliesand Home Alone 2 will go through the box office roofBut goodness knows where Macaulay goes from here Lost In Space perchanceTourist raped
