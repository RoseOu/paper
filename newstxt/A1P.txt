Pope rejects Runcie's vision of church leadershipFrom ANDREW BROWNReligious Affairs Correspondentin RomeTHE ARCHBISHOP of CanterburyDr Robert Runcieexchanged a symbolic kiss of peace with Pope John Paul II yesterday at a mass attended by thousands in St Peter's SquareRomeBut Dr Runcie's ideas of a limited primacy recognising the Pope as a central figure in the Christian Churchwho would exercise a primacy for the sake of unity and missionhave been rejected as insufficient by the PopeThey have also aroused Protestant anger against Dr Runcieat the same time as he has become involved in a row over his attack on the Phariseesof British societyThough Dr Runcie and his party could not take Holy Communion at the papal masshe had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the Anglican church in Rome after three demonstrators rose from the congregation as he ascended the pulpitthe visit has been dogged by protests from supporters of the Rev Ian PaisleyIn his sermonDr Runcie saidWe should ever recognise the scandal that Anglicans and Roman Catholics must celebrate two eucharists to make one memorial of our redemption on the day of our LordDr Runcie has gone out of his way on this visit to concede many of the doctrinal points and practices which large elements of the Church of England have traditionally found offensive in Roman CatholicismThe Popetoohas spoken warmly of unityOn Saturday the two prelates attended a service of vespers at the Church of San Gregoriowhich stands on the site where Pope Gregory sent St Augustine of Canterbury off to become the first Archbishop of Canterbury in 597But in their prepared homilies the Pope and the Archbishop addressed quite different problemsDr Runcie repeated his offer of a limited primacyinvolving the limited powers exercised by the popes in the first few centuries of the Christian ChurchHoweverthe Pope's account of the role of the papacy went a great deal farther than thatChristian unityhe saidmust be founded on the faith in Christ that was handed on by the Apostleswhat this faith is must be determined by the Roman Catholic ChurchHe quoted the Second Vatican CouncilThe task of giving an authentic interpretation of the Word of Godhas been entrusted to the living teaching office of the Church aloneThe specific role of bishops which is to be exercised in communion with the see of Peter in ensuring the unity and continuity of the faith is vital if we are to hand on the faith of PeterGregory and AugustineAll our efforts to restore unity among Christians will be in vain if they are not carried out in total fidelity to the faith in Christhanded on by the ApostlesIn a statement afterwards Dr Runcie stressed that he was not proposing any change in the British constitutionThe phrase universal primacyhas a spiritual meaningIt does not imply political supremacyand does not suggest that the Pope should administer the affairs of the Church of Englandhe saidBoth prelates referred to the consecration in February of the Rt Rev Barbara Harris as the Anglican Assistant Bishop of MassachussettsBishop Harris is quite unacceptable to the VaticanThe Pope saidEvents in recent years have seriously aggravated the differences between usThe Independent has learnt that 1,800 American Roman Catholic nuns wrote last winter to Dr Runcieurging him to defy the Pope over the ordination of womenSister Margaret Traxlerof the National Coalition of American Nunssaid that she had told Dr RuncieThe Roman Catholic Church says this is a deterrent to unitybut we sayhow can this be a deterrent to unity when discrimination against women is evilShe said she had received a friendly and brotherlyreply from Dr RuncieEast Germany lets 7,000 take the train westMore refugees join queue to escape through Prague and Warsaw embassies after cave-in by BerlinFrom PATRICIA CLOUGH in Bonn and EDWARD LUCAS in PragueAS SOME 7,000 exhausted but happy East Germans arrived in West Germany on special trains early yesterdayhundreds who missed the trains joined the queue to go west at embassies in Prague and WarsawIn Prague last nightmore than 200 were allowed into the West German embassy after spending the day on the pavement outsideMost arrived in the morningsome only minutes after Czechoslovak police sealed off the buildingThe West German AmbassadorHermann Huberwho earlier in the day told the new arrivals the transfer of 4,000 to West Germany was a one-off actionappeared again to tell themFor the time being we are letting you inHans-Dietrich Genscherthe West German Foreign Ministerwent on television to say he hoped for a parallel solutionfor the new arrivalsIn Warsawdozens of East Germans were last night waiting in front of the embassyfilling out forms and wondering where they would spend the nightAs the East German trains pulled into the border station of Hof the first refugeesmany of them in tearswere greeted with cheersapplause and a local youth group singing the Beatles song Let It BeThey were welcomed by government officalsRed Cross teams with hot teasoup and nappiesand local people with clothes and toysDoctors had been deeply worried about the 4,000 refugees from Praguewho had been camping in the embassy grounds in squalid conditionssurrounded by ankle-deep mud and sleeping in shifts on the available bedsThey were quickly sent on to reception campsYesterday's sudden departure followed what appeared to have been an almost total cave-in by East Germanyanxious to have the matter out of the way by the country's fortieth anniversary on SaturdayAll but about 300 of the East Germans had flatly refused an offer of guaranteed permission to go to the West providing they returned to East Germany firstSounder what appeared to be an informal deal between BonnBerlinPrague and Warsawthe special trains passed through East German territory on the way out but with senior West German officials on board as a guaranteeSoon afterwards the embassy in Prague was sealed off unilaterally by Czechoslovak policeThis prompted the Foreign Ministry in Bonn to lodge a protest with the Czechoslovak ambassadorLast nightthe East German Foreign Ministry issued a statement attacking the attitude of the refugeesSome East German citizens will justifiably ask why we let these people emigrate to West Germany via East Germanyeven though they had grossly violated our lawssaid the statement read as the main television news itemAmong these people there are anti-social elements who have a bad attitude to work and also to normal living conditionsEarlierEast Germany had announced the solution as a humanitarian actby the governmentadding that it hoped Bonn in future would run its embassies in normal manner according to international usageWest Germany had expected around 5,000 refugees including 809 from Warsawwho arrived in Helmstedt but more kept pouring from the special trainsHundreds had evidently gone straight to the station in Prague without contacting the embassyThere were also reports that some had jumped on the trains as they passed through East Germanyor that the numbers could have included previously uncounted childrenAnother 735 East Germans arrived by way of Hungary and Austriabringing to 31,000 the total of East Germans who have come out since Hungary opened its borders on 11 SeptemberThe journey through East Germany was terribleone woman said yesterdayShe feared a trap when the train stopped for 45 minutes on the wayIt turned out that East German security merely wanted to take away their identity cards so they could be formally expelledAt the Prague embassy on Saturday nightcheers greeted the news that the refugees would be leaving the same night as Mr GenscherMr Genscherwho appears to have arranged the solution in talks with his East GermanCzechoslovak and Polish counterparts in the United Nationssaid his trip to Prague was the most moving of his careerThe refugees were the same age as he was when he escaped from East Germany 37 years agoIn his special broadcast last nightMr Genscher said he hoped President Gorbachevwho will visit East Berlin for the anniversary this weekendwill try to convince East Germany that political reforms are also in its own interestLabour would keep tight rein on spendingBy ANTHONY BEVINSPolitical EditorJOHN SMITHthe shadow Chancelloryesterday set the overriding tone for this week's Labour Party conference with a warning that he would impose tough spending controls if Labour won the next electionHis warning casts doubt on Labour's commitment to increase spending on priorityprogrammes for the health service and pensionsMr Smith said in an interview on BBC television's On the Record that he did not expect his colleagues to spend and spend again' when they took officeHe conceded that there would be disputes with colleaguesbut saidThere are no quick fixesand I will not be indulging in any quick fixA quick fix clearly becomes unfixedThere are realities that I cannot changeThere will be the reality of the economic situation which we inheritwhich will not be our faultbut it will be our responsibilityWhen we've got an economic messthe first duty of a government is to clear up the economic messNow if that means we have to postpone some of our social ambitionsthen we may have to do soBut it will not mean that we are abandoning themWe will tackle putting our economy in order so that we can achieve that social ambitionso that the strong economy is used to finance and develop the fair societyAs for his colleaguesMr Smith saidWe're all agreed that we cannot spend what we have not earned and we intend to earn it before we spend itThat will be the guiding light of the next Labour governmentWhen I insist on that priorityas I can tell you I most certainly will with the full support of the Prime Minister in doing so then I'm sure my colleagues will see the point of thatNow it is quite right of themof courseto allow our social obligations not to be forgottenthere'll probably be an argumentThere are in all governments between the Treasury and spending ministersBut they will take into account the need for that balance that says that social spending without underpinning by economic growth will not be sustained in any eventMr Smith's warning coincided with a call by Ken Livingstonethe Labour MP for Brent Eastwho said on London Weekend Television's The Walden InterviewYou can be miles ahead in the pollsbut when you get to the last three weekspeople thinkCan I afford a Labour governmentWe need to say now what we are going to spendwhere the money is going to come fromMr Livingstone called for cuts in defence spendingDavid Blunkettanother member of the national executivetold a conference fringe rally organised by the soft-left Labour Coordinating Committee that Labour would have to find additional funds for its social programme by cutting £9.5bn from defence spending over five yearsand raising the level of taxation on the richThe policy review's top rate of income tax 50 per centwas too lowhe saidAlthough the policy review will be endorsed by the conferencegiving Neil Kinnock the freedom to go on to the offensive against the Conservatives in the run-up to the next general electionthere are a number of areas of potential conflictCalls for consideration of electoral reform and a new form of black representation are both expected to be defeatedRon Toddthe general secretary of the transport workers' unionsaid that today's vote on the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield the massive and overwhelmingmajority predicted by right-wingersand he warned that party leaders could not expect everybody to goose-stepin the same direction once the policy had been carriedThe conference opened with Labour buoyed by a series of weekend opinion polls

unrelenting public suspicion over nuclear power is causing mounting problems for the Soviet energy industryOfficials now warn that fuel supplies could be seriously disrupted this winterThis is the last thing President Mikhail Gorbachev needsas he tries to contain a staggering economic crisisBut every sign now is that to shortagesinflation and a runaway budget deficit must be added serious

have given bleak warnings over the state of affairs in both the oil and coal industriesthe largest of their kind in the worldIn oilthe main problem is administrative disruption following last June's merger of the oil and gas industries and the switch to greater financial autonomy for individual production unitscoupled with intended massive cutbacks in capital investment plans as the government seeks to balance its own booksThe situation is desperately seriousthe Deputy Oil MinisterVladimir Filanovsky-Zenkovtold the Socialist Industry newspaper last weekThe vast bulk of enterprises are not ready for changeThey do not want to operate independently because they are unable to do soOil output would be at least 12 million tonnes below the planned 1989 level of 624 million tonnesOver the next five years there would be shortfalls of tens of millions of tonnesunless new investments came on streamhe warned almost as the government announced that capital spending in the energy sector would be slashed by 40 per centThe coal industry faces similar problems following last summer's strikes in the Ukraine and central SiberiaMikhail Shchadovthe Minister for Coaltold the Trud newspaper yesterday
