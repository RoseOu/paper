Good sense and justice sought in immigration issueQueen's Bench Division Regina v Immigration Appeal Tribunalex parte Rafique Before Mr Justice Simon Brown December 7 1989WHEN a man applies to come to the United Kingdom to marry a woman settled hereit is not necessary for him to be able to state specifically whether he intends to settle in this country forever or whether he wishes to marry and return to his own countryIf an applicant is uncertain as to his plans after marriagethe entry clearance officer should treat it as an application for settlementand consider whether all the requirements for settlement are satisfiedThe factsAbid Hussaina Pakistaniis engaged to be married to Miss Rafiquea British citizenand they want to be married in EnglandMr Hussain was refused entry clearance to come to Englandmainly because he could not say what were his long term intentionsWhen interviewed Mr Hussain said he had not decided whetherfollowing marriageheor his fianceewould wish to remain in England or return to PakistanThe entry clearance officer ECOsaid he was not satisfied that the primary purpose of Mr Hussain's intended marriage was not to obtain admittance to the UKMr Hussain appealedThe adjudicator concluded that Mr Hussain's application was for a short-term stay and dismissed the appeal after hearing evidence from Miss Rafique that she had no intention of living in PakistanThe immigration appeal tribunal said the onus was on an applicant to bring himself within the specific immigration ruleand if he was unable or unwilling to do so he could not expect to succeedMr Hussain appealedThe RulesRule 41 of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC 169providesA man seeking to enter the UK for marriage to a woman settled here and who intends to settle here thereafterwill be refused entry clearance unless the ECO is satisfied that it is not the primary purpose of the marriage to obtain admission to the UKUnder rule 17 a man may apply for entry clearance to the UK for marriage where he and his wife will leave the UK after the marriageThe decisionMr Justice Simon Brown said that shortly before the tribunal came to its decision in this case a tribunal chaired by Professor Jackson took a different approach in a similar caseSyed Jabar Hussain ShahThat tribunal said that to force an applicant to state whether he intends to live here foreveror for a period of not less than six monthsinvites deceit and was somewhat removed from realityThat tribunal said that where there was uncertainty as to the duration of the stay it was proper to consider the application as if ordinary residence was contemplatedMr Justice Simon Brown said he greatly preferred the approach adopted by Professor Jackson's tribunalIt accorded with good sense and justiceand also properly reflected the important impact of the House of Lords' decision in Shah v Barnet Borough Council 19832 AC 309 upon the statutory definition of settlement for Immigration Act purposesIn Shah's case Lord Scarman saidAll that is necessary is that the purpose of living where one does egfor educationemploymenthealthfamily or merely love of the placehas a sufficient degree of continuity to be properly described as settledWhy should an applicantwho must in any event be prepared to satisfy the primary purpose testbe worse off because he contemplates the possibility of a relatively short stay in the UK than one who had the fixed intention of permanent UK residenceIt was logical to construe the phrase intending to settlein rule 41 differently from the contrasting phrase admitted for settlementwhich appears elsewhereThere was no possible good reason why rule 41 should not encompass those genuinely undecided as to their long term ambitionsAccordingly the tribunal in Mr Hussain's case fell into errorThey categorised all applicantsgenuine or otherwisewho were unable or unwilling to specify their long term intentionsas necessarily falling outside the ambit of the rules and thus doomed to inevitable failure when applying for entry clearanceThe essence of what Mr Hussain said was that following the marriage he would remain in England on a settled basis as a married man for just so long as his wife dictatedAnd for good measureit should be noted that the ECO long ago expressed his own conclusion that settlement in the UK was the intention in this caseThe tribunal's decision was quashed and the appeal restored for hearing as an appeal against a refusal of entry clearance under rule 41The crucial issue still to be determined was whether the primary purpose of the marriage was to obtain admission to the UKIf the immigration authorities concluded that Mr Hussain's assertion that he was undecided as to his long term intentions was pretended rather than genuineclearly that would weigh against him in the primary purpose issueThat was a general possibility and there was no reason to suppose that that would be the conclusionAppearancesRamby De

partsWarren Tute was thought by those who knew him only slightly to be a good raconteur and a popular member of the GarrickHoweverhe was a writer with a number of plays to his creditnone of them great successes but all worthy of noteAfter leaving the Navy he also wrote much fictionand as a novelist in the early post-war years his first published workThe Felthams 1950was thought highly of and his bestsellerThe Rock 1957served to establish him as a writer of more than a little promiseWith such biographical works as Admiral CochraneEarl of Dundonald 1965and his absorbing record of those 1940 operations involving the French fleetThe Deadly Stroke 1973he broke into non-fiction tooTute was educated at Wrekin Collegejoined the Navy as a paymaster-cadet and served his apprenticeship throughout the thirtiesbecoming secretary to the Captain of the FleetMediterraneanHe took part inthe naval landings in North Africahelped plan further landings in Sicilyand towards the war's end he became deputy secretary to the chief of combined operationsAfter the warTute worked in a variety of jobs where his skills as both sailor and writer were much in demand broadcastingfilm-makingand as script editor for London Weekend TelevisionHe also had a finger in theatrical production and I first knew him when he was associated with Elspeth Cochrane's literary management during the 1960sOne of his most enterprising productions was Little Mary Sunshine in 1962Happy and novel and thoroughly charmingit gave several talented artists their first big chancegoing on to biggerif hardly better thingsNone was

first American atomic bomb sent a team of spooksto NaplesOne of their main assignments was to contact Edoardo Amaldia physicist thought to be in hiding near RomeSix months laterthe day before Rome's liberation by the AlliesAmaldi was foundHe was interviewed by Moe Bergthen one of the most famous baseball players in AmericaBerg was also an agent of the Office of Strategic Serviceswhich was later to give birth to the CIAHis job was to convince Amaldi to pack his bags because there was a ship waiting at Naples to take him to the United StatesAmaldi's presence there had been sought by two other Italian colleaguesalso physicistsHis mentorEnrico Fermilater to be called the father of the bomband Emilio Segre who died in California earlier this yearAmaldi dodged the American invitationperhaps because with Rome liberatedFermi's mantle in physics had fallen on his young shoulders and there were younger minds to teachHe wore that mantle well at Rome University until his retirement in 1978But Amaldi never really retired nor grew oldHe kept regular hours in the university's physics buildingspoke at scientific meetings this year in Moscow and WashingtonAs President of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei he had delivered the welcoming address on Tuesday to a symposium of scientistsHe then ordered a car to call for him the next morning for a similar occasion and was felled by a stroke while waiting for the liftAmaldi grew up in a small town in Lombardyand took his doctorate in physics from Rome at the remarkably early age of 21In 1929he became one of the ragazzi di Via Panisperna the street where Fermi's kidscarried out their own experiments under the master in their own under-financed labEmilio Segre was one kidand Bruno Pontecorvolater to defect from Britain to the Soviet UnionanotherIt is interesting to note that the popeas the kids called Fermi because he's always rightwas only seven years older than AmaldiAmaldi astounded his group in October 1934 with his discovery that by slowing downrather than acceleratingneutronshe could provoke intense nuclear reactionsHe held a chair in physics from 1937 until his retirement publishing more than 150 papers on atomic and nuclear physicsHe was awarded honorary degrees by AlgiersGlasgow and OxfordHe became a founderand active executiveof the European Centre for Nuclear Research in GenevaI had the pleasure of two long talks last year with Professor Amaldi about his knowledge of what the German physicists were doing with their atoms during the war yearsApart for his incongruously white hairAmaldi seemed to have the mental lucidity and expected energy of a man half his ageHis modestyconsidering his world-wide fame in his fieldwas endearingI knew almost nothing about physics but we shared some jokes about the Rome telephone systemIn 1949Amaldi wrote to the Italian prime minister asking for permission to produce and sell sealing wax for lettersso that we may raise needed funds for our physics labThe reply came from an under-secretary who said that the present funding was considered adequate and the commercial undertaking would be ill-advisedIt was signed by Giulio Andreottithe present prime ministerGeorge

Denenberg reports Putting jobs on the lineBUILDING work on a new county jail in Florida was falling woefully behind scheduledespite the critical need for additional space to house the many arrested as suspected drug offendersPressed to account for the delayan embarrassed local official explained that the project was lagging because too few construction workers could pass the drug test required of all job seekersThe Florida county's ironic predicament illustrates the extent to which drug testing is relied upon by some US employers to screen the workforceThe growing propensity to sample bodily fluids for contraband chemicals has engendered a bitter legal struggle over an employee's right of privacya conflict which could spread to Europe along with fear of crackFor many workersthe ability to survive a drug testmost commonly a urinalysis for illicit chemicals such as cannabis and cocaineis becoming a prerequisite to getting and holding a jobOn orders from the White Houseperhaps as many as a million federal government emloyees are now subject to testingWielding its regulatory stickWashington is compelling the aviationrail and trucking industries to test thousands of pilotstrain crews and lorry driversA survey by the US Department of Labor revealed that about a fifth of private-sector workersmainly employees of large corporationsare already subject to testingJob applicants are spurned if they register positiveon a testoften without learning the reason for their rejectionSuccessful applicants may be subjected to surprise random testing once they are hired -names of those who must provide a urine specimen are picked in a computerised lotteryOthers are tested when an industrial accident occurson the theory that it creates a reasonable suspicionof drug impairmenteven though faulty equipment or poor weather conditions may more plausibly account for the mishapStill others are tested if they apply for promotion to positions which are deemed sensitiveRefusing to be tested or coming up positive usually results in immediate sackingMany unfair dismissal hearings centre on the arcane testimony of forensic chemiststoxicologists and psychopharmacologists specialists in mood-altering substancesThe testing boom has been resisted vigorously by civil liberties groups and trade unionswho view this aspect of the war on drugsas a frontal assault on a worker's dignity and entitlement to due processThe obligation to urinate on demand offends many employeesparticularly when an offical monitor given the Orwellian title of Collection Site Personin government regulations stands by to guard against deceptive practicesUrine advertised as free of detectable drugs is on offer by mail-order to anxious test takerswho could try to substitute it for their ownLast springthe US Supreme Court dealt the unions a blow by rulingin a suit brought by treasury employees and rail workersthat for critical occupations such as a customs agenttesting does not curtail constitutional rightsApplying a balancing testthe court held that the danger posed by drug abuse outweighed the individual's expectation of privacyDespite that setbackopponents strive to contain the spread of testing through further litigationAn argument often made in their briefsagainst random testing in particularis that it reverses the normal presumption of innocencean employee is deemed guilty unless he can prove himself innocent by producing cleanurineUnlike the familiar blood alcohol tests in motoring casesurinalysis does not demonstrate that the employee is impaired by drugsIt merely detects residues of drugs ingested as much as weeks in the pastwhen the worker may well have been off-duty or on holidayAn official of the American Civil Liberties Union has protestedFiring people who come to work sober because of their condition on Saturday night is of debatable valueThe civil libertarians argue that testing permits the employer to delve deeply into an employee's personal lifea specimen can be analysedwithout the subject's knowledgeto reveal confidential medical conditionssuch as epilepsy or pregnancyDrug testing also may disproportionally victimise members of racial minority groups whose subcultures sanction casual marijuana smokingreversing much of the progress that has been made in eliminating employment discriminationAKEY ISSUE in the litigation is the accuracy of the analytical technologyTesting has created a gold rush for the diagnostics industrythe largely unregulated private laboratories in which boxes of specimen jarsresembling crates of milk bottlesare processed in assembly-line fashionErrors sometimes occurin part because an innocuous substance may trigger a positivePoppy seeds sprinkled on bread as a flavouring have a disconcerting tendency to react chemically in the same way as the extract of the opium poppyso that a worker could be mistaken for a heroin user because of what he ate for breakfastThe government's own Center for Disease Control discovered serious reporting errors when quality verification samples were posted to a number of laboratories as an experimentAlthough the government has since promulgated guidelines to standardise analytical methodsdoubts remain about whether laboratories can be relied upon not to make technical and clerical mistakes which could result in someone's dischargeWhen mistakes are madethey can prompt complex law suitsAn electricity generating company in California sued a laboratory which failed to properly document its analysisthe company was trying to recover from the laboratory the costs of settling a suit for unfair dismissal brought by an employee who lost her job because of the testAppearing as witnesses in courtsome physicians have suggested that it is foolhardy to jeopardise a person's livelihood because of a laboratory report when the worker appears to be performing his job normallyNo doctor would order surgery or other treatment on the basis of a single test resultthey point outwithout corroborating clinical evidenceJob-related performance testingsuch as use of flight simulators to check the condition of pilotshas been suggested as a preferable substitute for the drug huntThere is a theory that even if drug testing is flawedit at least deters drug useYet addiction specialists scoff at the notion that someone who already faces death through overdose or through contracting Aids from hypodermic needles is likely to change his behavour because of a drug testAndalthough the Supreme Court upheld testing of customs agentsa few members of the bench doubted that a drug-imbibing agent would be deterred by a test if he was not already fearfulas one put itthat he may be shot dead in unequal combat with unimpaired smugglersTESTING for a short list of illicit drugs has been labelled as myopicsince the working population as a whole tends to abuse a vast pharmacopoeia of legal but impairing substancesmany of them heavily promoted by distilleries and pharmaceutical firmsA consumer group recently forced the withdrawal of a medical advertisement which invited doctors to prescribe tranquilizers for air traffic controllers suffering from job stress as they pore over their radar scopesThe addiction specialists urge that the emphasis be shifted to eliminating underlying conditionssuch as job stress and tediumagainst which workers often seek to medicate themselvesRather than focusing on a few substances which are painted in lurid coloursthe specialists saythe goal should be a workplace free of compulsive chemical use of all kindsSince testing is typically used not to facilitate treatment of addicted workers but to sack them a process sardonically referred to as dismissal therapythe upshot could be a recriminalisationof addictionThat would undo decades of effort to have chemical dependency recognised as a treatable disorder rather than as a moral lapse deserving of punishmentEven though drug testing has attracted the most controversyit is merely part of a broad movement in America toward a Darwinian worker-selection policywhich has been dubbed employment of the fittestEmployees are routinely subjected to psychological screening and polygraph tests to evaluate their honestyCharacter is probed by handwriting analystsGenetic screeningto determine if the worker's chromosomes render him vulnerable to occupational illnesslooms on the horizonMultiple layers of screeningmuch of it of dubious scientific validitymay become a routine feature of working life unless restraints are imposed by lawas some states have begun to doWhile it approved some types of drug testingthe Supreme Court did leave the anti-testing forces a glimmer of hope for ultimate legal containmentIt held that in principle a drug test is a searchwithin the meaning of the Fourth Amendment in the Bill of RightsSince the amendment bans unreasonable searches and seizuresthe possibility remains that a test may be found unreasonable if the job is so non-critical that public needs fail to outweigh individual privacy interestsDrug testing opponents may also take comfort from the surprising dissent by arch-conservative Justice Antonin ScaliaHe disparaged the customs service testing programme as mere displaya gesture of solidarity with the President's anti-drug campaignSacrificing civil libertiesJustice Scalia sneeredcannot be the means of making a pointR.

SAGANSKYFOR EUROPE ENVIRONMENT ONLY Power without the peopleBy Koy ThompsonSPANNING four continents and 70 countriesit is hardly surprising that the causesand hence solutions to tropical forest destruction shift from region to regionCommon threads nonetheless emergeTropical forests are almost always in developing countries suffering from varying degrees of poverty and debtEconomic pressures on forests are immenseplacing them on the cutting-edge of the reconciliation between environment and developmentSohow do we save themPrevalent conservation orthodoxy advocates protection through productionShow that forests have a tangible value kept as forestsfor example for timberand countries will manage them for a sustained cash yieldThis top-down approach is favoured by the two major institutions charged with saving the tropical foreststhe International Tropical Timber Organisationand the World Bank and UN backed Tropical Foresty Action PlanTheir solution offers money and resources to the powerfulTechnically sweet and politically acceptableit avoids accusation of moral hypocrisy by using economic arguments to appeal to self interestUnfortunately the timber industry is shot through with economic inefficiencyWeak forestry services are subordinate to production figures and dominated by wealthy elitesoften politicianswho stand to gain tremendously from short-term liquidation of forest assetsThe benefits to the poor are triflingand for native peoplesinvariably negativeThis dire situation exists despite a welter of management plansroyaltiestaxesand feesPutting your tropical forest conservation eggs in the hardwood basket is a high risk strategySome argue for weaning countries from timber centrism by showing the higher economic value to be had from non-wood products harvested without harming forestsBut despite detailed studies in AmazoniaMalaysia and Indonesiathere is little evidence that this persuasive economic argument has turned countries away from logging or forest conversionThe failure is not in the argumentwhich is powerful and importantbut in the approachIt would take an heroic leap of imagination to suppose that those same forestry services with a proven inability to manage just one producttimbercould presently perform the economic and administrative gymnastics necessary to fully value and manage forests for multiple benefitsSometime in the futuresophisticated economic valuation may be critical for striking a global bargain for forest conservation between north and southBut right now what is needed is a bottom-up approachentrusting the forests to those increasingly organised peoples whose survival has depended for generations on environmental knowledgeThese forest peoples movementsthe Indiansthe rubber trappersand ural unionsare well known in Brazilbut exist widelyfor example in KenyaIndiathe Phillippines and MalaysiaThey are organised and prepared to resist the destruction of the forestsInvolving people directly in decision making about forest developmentand in their active managementrecognises the socialpoliticaland economic roots of the forest crisisEconmomic arguments are useful but sustainable development is fundamentally a moral conceptbased on the common goodjusticeand equityKoy Thomson is International Rainforest Campaigner with Friends of the EarthStanding up to be counted CommentaryBy Melanie PhillipsAN extraordinary scene took place this weekMr Jack Hibbertthe head of the Government Statistical Serviceappeared in front of some 300 statisticians at a public meeting to defend the reputation and integrity of his service and the official information it purveysIt was an unprecedented public appearance by the ultimate grey man in front of a deeply critical and anxious audience of greyish men and a few womenSo sensitive was the occasionapproval had to be given by none other than the Cabinet Secretary and the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury before Mr Hibbert could be exposed to the harsh winds of public controversyFor official statistics have become tainted by more than disagreementthe charges being levelled against the service amount to the politicisation of knowledgea form of intellectual corruption and a scandalous abuse of powerConcern has been growing for some time nowvoiced not only by the media but also by some high-powered academicsex-civil servants and former senior government statisticiansthat official information which should be wholly objective is being distortedsuppressed or otherwise interfered with to serve the political ends of the governmentThis anxiety has been fuelled byfor examplechanges to the basis of counting the numbers of unemployed peoplechanging the index for measuring poverty or using official figures to claim that the health service is enjoying unprecedented prosperityIn additionthe Rayner review of the service introduced not only cuts but a new philosophy that official figureswhich previously had been for the service of the nation as a wholewere now to be tied far more closely to the requirements of the government of the dayThe statisticians are rightly extremely troubled by the loss of public confidence in official figuresOfficial information provides the basis on which voters can decide on the record of the government and accordingly make an informed electoral choiceAs custodians of objective factsstatisticians know that the priceless asset of the truth must never be squandered in the interests of political expediencynot least because the public will then refuse to believe information that is actually trueThe grave claim that politicians are muddying the clear statistical waters has been made on a mumber of occasions now by Sir Claus Mosera former head of the government statistical serviceHe repeated his worry this week about the changes to the unemployment and poverty registers and the apparent wish to change the basis of the retail price indexProfessor Sir David Cox of Nuffield CollegeOxfordan expert on among other things Aids statisticsno doubt had uppermost in his mind the Prime Ministerial axing of the Lifestyle Aids survey when he referred to increasing political pressure and lamented the sinking reputation of official statisticsAnd a former deputy head of the Office of PopulationCensuses and SurveysMr Philip Redferntrenchantly criticised his erstwhile colleagues for lacking the openness and courage to swim against the political tideFaced with all thisMr Hibbert's speech was a masterpiece of sanitised complacency which looked pitifully inadequate as a response to such well-placed anxietiesThe statistical servicesaid Mr Hibbertwas completely open about its methodsYessaid his criticsbut it was a different story if anyone tried to get access to the information behind those methodsThe recent report by Profesor Richard Benjaminfor examplehad castigated the government for deliberately obstructing access to certain data such as the Family Expenditure SurveyThen there was the troublesome question of the unemployment statisticsPublishing the old figures compiled from Job Centressaid Mr Hibbertalongside the new ones might have been a good idea just to show how misleading the old ones had beenFor good measureup popped Mr Peter StibbardDirector of Statistics at the Department of EmploymentMr Stibbard appeared outraged by any suggestion of improprietyThe change in the figures appeared to be due to things like administrative convenienceTotal professional integrityhe smoothedBut then up popped Mr Geoffrey Penriceone of Mr Stibbard's predecessorsIn 1979he saidthe incoming government had felt the unemployment figures were too highMinisters wanted to change their presentation and their contentThe expression on Mr Hibbert's face didn't changeHe continued to nod and smileBut Mr Penrice had given the game awayThe figures had been changed for political reasonsThe crucial distinction drawn by Mr Hibbert and others is between the figures themselvessimon pure as they areand the possibly misleading use made of them by politicians and othersIn other wordsthe statisticians are anxious to prove that their hands are cleanhowever stained politicians may beBut it's not as simple as thatTo sayas Mr Hibbert didthat statisticians cannot publicly dispute any misleading use politicians may make of official information is a weaselly argumentThey have a duty to set the record straightotherwise they are conniving at falsehoodPhilip Redfern suggested it should become standard practice for statisticians to put their professional advice on the recordThere is no valid argument against such an obvious improvement to the democractic processBut to speak out publicly without fear of retribution statisticians must become wholly independent of governmentas happens in many other European countriesAnd this august body of quintessential back-room people must now press loudly and firmly for this to happenIt's not enough to implyas Jack Hibbert didthat protests are being made to ministers behind the scenesIt's understood that he has now been twice to complain to the Prime Minister that ministers are trying to make his staff do things he finds improperBrownie points for gutsif truebut public confidence is not going to be restored in the integrity of official information unless it is seen to be properly independent

aircraft than anywhere else is get drunkThe cabin is usually stabilised at less than atmospheric pressureso its air has less oxygen than usualYour body burns alcohol more slowlyso a little drink can get you seriously sloshedand you stay that way longerNo wonder the airlines vie with each other to advertise their copious offerings of wineTo bring the same advantages to earthbound drinkersDaedalus is inventing a low-pressure pubThe building will need to be carefully leak-proofed against the outside airand customers will have to enter by an air-lockThe beerits bubbles expanded by the reduced pressurewill be fizzier than ever and magically intoxicatingRowdy customers will be hard to throw out through the double pressure doors of the air-lockbut at closing time Daedalus will reverse the pumps and take the pressure up above atmosphericNot only will the beer suddenly go flatthe extra oxygen in the high-pressure air will rapidly burn the alcohol out of the client's bloodstreamsExperienced topers will leave promptlybefore their merry glow is chilled into doom-laden sobrietyBut Daedalus goes furtherHe points out that an animal's life span is linked to its metabolic rateIf you slow its metabolism by restricted dietit will mature more slowly and live longer than normalthe clock of its life will slow downSince reduced pressure also slows the metabolic rateit too should slow and lengthen a creature's biological careerAnd if the principle works with man as wellthen by spending your whole life in a cruising aircraft you might live to be a hundredOr perhaps it would only seem like thatSo Dreadco's physiologists are setting up a variable-pressure metabolic laboratory to study the matterAnimals and human volunteers will be maintained at various atmospheric pressures and oxygen concentrations while their biochemistry is monitoredDaedalus expects that his under-pressured volunteers will lose appetite and be quite happy on two meals a dayespecially if he provides airline foodBut how to judge their rate of ageingDreadco is appealing for middle-aged identical twinsone to live in the low-pressure laboratory and one outsidewhile microscopic examination compares the rate at which grey hairs appear on their scalpsThe effects of high pressures should also be interestingMetabolism may speed up sharplyso that obese volunteers would be swiftly burnt downto normal weightAnimals might mature fastera pressurised poultry housefor examplecould hurry chickens to earlier adulthoodBut apart from aircraft and submarinesfew human environments could incorporate such refinements into their normal operationsDaedalus is designing a novel house extensiona variable-pressure bedroomwhich may purchase an extra few years of life for its proud owners by slowing the metabolic rate of that third of their lifetime which they spend asleepOVERNIGHT FILE PAGE sc
