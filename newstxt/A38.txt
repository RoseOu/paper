MotoringA lead-free lover's guide to used carsDrivers with a tight budget and an environmental conscience can buy second-hand without losing principlessays James RuppertBy JAMES RUPPERTFROM this monthall new cars submitted for British type approvalthe test which allows them to be legally sold in the UKmust be able to run on lead-free petrolAs a result of this ruleand many carefully orchestrated publicity campaignsthe motor industry's image has now changed from polluter to pal of the earthIf you can afford an environmentally friendly G-registered runaboutthen the florafauna and children of the British Isles will have a lot to thank you forBut if you have a tight budget and a consciencerunning older cars on lead-free fuel becomes a much more complicated issueWithout the presence of a lead compoundan engine's valve seats go unprotectedThis leads to premature wear and plumes of blue smoke spewing from the exhaustThe only effective remedy is to install hardened valve seats or a replacement cylinder headboth expensive optionsLess costlybut not entirely satisfactoryis the practice of making every fourth tankful leaded petrolwhich protects the valve seats but rather defeats the objectAlternatively there are several chemical additives on the market which aim to provide a substitute for leadalthough the case for these products has yet to be provedHowevermany cars built within the last few years have hardened valve seatsor alloy cylinder heads that need little simply a retuneor no modification to use unleaded petrolFinding out which cars can and which cannot is not difficultEsso filling stations have a free booklet listing most models produced since 1980as does the charity Clear 01-387 4970with more detail available in the Unleaded Petrol Guide Autodale£2.99Looking at those lists provides interesting reading and bears out the used-car trade's view that having a lead-only car could prove to be a liabilityIt is not as if four-star leaded fuel is going to be phased out tomorrowbut more and more buyers are askingDoes it take unleadedWhat is certain is that the pre-1989 Austin/MG rangeall SkodasYugos and quite a few Lancias do notwhich does not help already depressed resale pricesA 1985 Lancia Y10 lead onlysells for around £2,000 whereas the similar Fiat Uno 55 from the same yearconverted to run on unleadedis worth around £500 moreA lead-only second-hand car is now worth about 10 per cent less than an unleaded equivalentIn years to come the percentage difference is likely to be much largerEven soexotica such as lead-only Porsche 911s and Ferraris are unlikely to be part of this trendso no bargains there I'm afraidMore impressive are the Japanese manufacturers whose cars dating from the early Eighties can run on unleaded without adjustmentFind a 1980 Toyota Corolla or 1982 Nissan Sunny that has not succumbed to rustand you can buy with confidenceOn the home frontmost Fords and Vauxhalls from at least the mid-Eighties can use unleadedIf the greennessof going unleaded still seems a bit of a grey areait is possible to switch to diesel without a shadow of environmental doubtDiesel always has been lead-free and the only adjustments you need to make are mental onesbecause diesel-powered cars are no longer slowsmelly or noisyThey also return more miles to the gallon than their petrol equivalentsalthough service intervals are shorterBut after the publicity on unleaded fuel there has been increased interest in used diesel powerBut remember that these cars accrueand can withstandsignificantly higher mileages than petrol cars50-90,000 being the normThe tradition for diesel cars is far better established on the Continent and that is where the best buys come fromPerhaps the most successful maker is Peugeotwith a complete range of cars from the small 205 around £3,000 for a 90,000-mile 1985 car to the legendary 504 estateabout £2,000 for a 1982 exampleThe Germans are also fairly accomplished manufacturersalthough a five-door 1980 Golf with a six-figure mileage will still cost £1,500Prestige comes in the shape of a Mercedes with the 240D or Stuttgart Taxicommanding £7,000 but returning unfailing reliabilityEven if lead levels in the atmosphere do not bother youI am sure you will find the fact that unleaded petrol is 15p cheaperand that diesel fuel boosts mpg by at least a thirdmost interestingMotoringMiles of smiles as the diesel comes of ageBrett Fraser on the Citroen AXwhich offers fuel economy without much sacrifice in performance to drivers willing to turn away from the petrol engineBy BRETT FRASERBACK IN the bad old daysdrivers of diesel cars were the social outcasts of the motoring worldAt filling stations they were banished to the far-flung corners of the forecourtaway from the well-lit protection of covered petrol pumpsto battle 32-tonners for a turn at the diesel pumpThat was not the end of their woeUntil recentlydiesel cars were slow and very noisythe theory being that this was the price you had to pay for economyThere was a social stigma attached to diesel car ownershiptooPeople thought perhaps you needed to save money after allthat was the only reason for buying a diesel carwasn't itWhat few realised was that diesels were more costly than their petrol-engine counterpartsand that the break-even point when the fuel savings outweighed the price differencedidn't occur until very large mileages had been coveredThose who sold their diesels after 50,000 miles or so might just as well have bought a petrol vehicleAt least that was the case in Britainwhere the gap between petrol and diesel fuel prices has always been smallOn the Continentgovernments have actively encouraged the use of diesel-powered vehicles as a way of stretching resourcesNot only is diesel much less expensive at the pumpsespecially in France and Italybut purchase tax on diesel-powered cars is reducedTravel the roads of Italyand petrol-engine cars appear to be in the minorityEven the Italians' up-market makersAlfa and Lanciahave diesel modelsIn Germanydiesel sales are in sharp decline after the Greens pointed an ill-informed finger at the visibly dirty exhausts of diesels and cried polluterIn factdiesels are cleaner in many ways than petrol engines in their emissionsGerman manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen are so convinced of the diesel engine's future importancethey are developing clean-burnunits and fitting catalytic converters to the exhaust systemsCurrently the French PSA Groupwhich comprises Citroen and Peugeotproduces the best diesel carsBestmeans a combination of economyspeedlow noisegeneral refinement and pleasure to driveJudged by these criteriathe little Citroen AX diesel is the best of a good bunchThe AX is the smallest of the Citroen range and is available in three-and five-door versionsComputers were used extensively during the car's developmentin a successful attempt to make the AX 220lb lighter than the class averageThe significance is the boost it gives to the AX's performanceparticularly in the context of the dieselHere is a diesel-engine car which will out-gun many of its petrol-engine rivalsIt comes close to shaming some of its own stable-matestooand they are among the swiftest in their classTop speed for this diesel is 96mphand it spurts to 60mph in just 13.2 secondsMost un-diesel-likeOn the roadthe biggest difference you notice with the diesel is the need to change up a gear slightly earlier than in a petrol carThis is not a hardshipas the AX is blessed with one of the lightest and quickest gear changes aroundThe diesel never feels slovenly and can be hurried along snaking back roads with the sort of haste which soon makes you forget that dervnot four-star or unleadedgoes into its fuel tankAnother way the AX deceives is by the noise it makesor rather the lack of itOnceall diesels sounded like taxis all the timeThe baby Citroen tends to give the game away only when started from coldAt 70mph it is hard to tell what fuels the carand only at idlewindows downdoes the noise start to irritateEven thenit is not so bad as to give you taxi syndromeOther noises do infiltrate the cabin the windthe odd bump and thump from the suspensionand the constant rattle and clunk from the cabin fittingsCitroen makes some fine carsbut it tends not to make them very wellThe plastic the French company uses for its interior trimmings is not of high quality and looks brittle and cheapand in most places it sounds not to be screwed as tightly down as the designers originally intendedLook into a cavernous gap down the right side of the dashboard and there are wires on display beyond themdaylightFor a light carthe AX rides surprisingly wellsoaking up most road surface horrors with dignified composureRough roadshoweverof the sort council repair crews seem so keen to createruffle it slightly and cause it to slap its tyres on the road in protestAnyone who thinks owning a diesel spells the end of driving funshould park their backside in the AX's comfortablesupportive driver's seat and go for a quick rideIt carries a bit more weight in its nose diesel engines are heavier than petrolbut the derv-sipping AX is just as agile as its petroleum cousinsLightaccurate steering allows you to place the car precisely in a bendand although there is a fair amount of body rollonce you've chosen your cornering line not even bumps half-way through will deflect the faithful AX from its pathIf you go into a corner too fast the tyres will lose their adhesionbut in the AX it is safe to take your foot off the throttle and let the car snap itself back into lineTry that on several cars in the Escort-classand you will sometimes watch the back of the car overtake the frontThe worst that happens when you overcook things in the AX is that the nose runs gently wideAnd what is the fuel economy likeWellfor a startignore the preposterous and irrelevant figures achieved on the recent RAC-supervised economy runUnless you drive everywhere at less than 40mph and never sit in traffic jamsthe record-breaking 112mpg is as achievable as drying flowers underwaterNeverthelesswatching the AX's fuel gauge fall to empty is a long and tedious vigilIn ordinary conditions a mix of blatting down the motorwaypootling down country roadsand getting stuck in London's slow-motion hours when the rest of the country apparently rushesfuel consumption in the mid-sixties is almost guaranteedWith careand clear roadsthat figure should greatly improveEven when driven with the utmost contempt for economyit is difficult to drop below 50mpgWhat is nice about the AX diesel is that you can smile smugly about the miles you are effortlessly squeezing from every gallonin the knowledge you have sacrificed little along the wayNo longer does the diesel driver need to feel disadvantagedSecond to the sporting GT modelthe dieselin either of its two trim levelsis the most desirable of the AX rangeFor that to be truethe diesel must have come of ageMotoringThe soaring triumph of the exotic StagBlow all your savings on a rare classic convertible which has just started to show a major rise in valuesays Roger BellBy ROGER BELLPSSTShares a bit shakyBored by your savings passbookThen now is the time to invest in a Triumph Stag but keep it to yourselfThere are not that many good ones aboutConvertible prices always tend to dip in the autumnparticularly after a balmy summerbut the advice to buy has little to do with cyclic depressionStags are appreciatingIn the crazy world of classic carswhere old Ferraris and Aston Martins fetch silly moneyand Jaguar E-types have gone through the roofthe rise and rise of these exotics over the past two or three years has lifted values down the lineIf Austin Rover's Leyland forebears had made a better job of the Stag in the first placevalues would probably have risen beforeAs it isthe car's great attraction as a luxury convertible has always been overshadowed by its reputation for poor reliabilityNot for nothing was it dubbed the Triumph SnagToday's Stagistiguided by the mechanical tragedies that befell their hapless predecessorsknow that preventive maintenance is the key to dependabilityAchieve that and it is achievablethough my own carcurrently without an engineis not yet there and the Stag's attractions are nothing short of seductiveMuch was expected of this Anglo-Italian four-place convertiblehigh on creature comforts as well as stylewhen it was introduced almost 20 years agoTriumph aimed to build 12,000 Stags a yearIn the eventit produced fewer than 26,000 in its seven years of manufacturing lifebetween 1970 and 1977Depressed productioncostly for Leyland at the timeis good news for investors now because it has endowed the Stag with scarcity appealIt goes without saying that rare cars are more coveted than common ones and rare convertibles are of blue-chip statusScarcity value apartthe Stag is made of the right stuff by classic yardsticksIt has style Michelotti'sa luxurioustimber-encrusted cabin with hard and soft headgearsix speeds to play with fourplus two overdrive on the manualthough many Stags had three-speed automatic transmissionand a burbling V8 engine that can be found in no other carIn its dayfully independent suspension like that of the Triumph 2000 saloonand lavish equipment that included power-assisted steering were also assetsIronicallythe Stag's reputation as an expensive liability is rooted in the three-litre145-horsepower engine effectively two four-cylinder Dolomite/Saab 99 units siamesed to a common crankshaft that is germane to the car's appealOverheating and loose valvegear chainsboth of which can abruptly extinguish all mechanical lifeare its avoidableweaknessesWith the wisdom of hindsightit is easy to see now that the Stag's troublesome V8designed and inadequately developed in-house by Triumph before it merged with Leylandshould have been ditched and replaced by Rover's proven ex-Buick 3.5-litre V8 still used by Land-RoverMorganTVR and othersthat was already on the shelfIn the interests of dependabilitymany Stags have subsequently been converted to Rover V8 powergaining in reliability and quite possibly in performancewhat they lose in originality and nose heavinessA Rover-engine Stag may well be a better car than one with Triumph powerbut as a hybrid it will never be so valuableFord V6 conversions are intrinsically even less desirable though worth considering as a cheap and reliable engineMany Stags have undergone reversion transplants in the quest for originalityTo buy a Stag just for its investment potential is to deny yourself the sort of al fresco luxury that most people can only dream about in a new carJaguar's classy convertibles start at £41,200albeit with V12 powerWhat is morethe current XJS ragtop is structurally inferior to the cabriolet with Stag-like superstructurethat preceded itOther classy convertibles come from Mercedes-BenzPorsche and Aston Martinwhose Volantelisted at £120,000is said to be changing hands at over £200,000Even the best Stags and the best are very good indeed are cheap by comparisonHere is stylishtousled-hair motoring without the discomfortHere is a car to be savoured at your leisureon high days and holidaysbut above all on sunny daysI enjoy my Stag most when it is loafing along in overdrive the DIY box has longer legs than the automaticexhaust burbling as only a twin-pipe V8 can burbleWhen there is nothing above your head but the bracing T-bar fitted as much to provide body rigidity as to anticipate US safety regulations that did not materialise so much the betterFrom February 1973all Stags were sold with both hood which stows neatly in a lidded well behind the back seatsand hardtop which required two pairs of strong arms to manipulateSo heavy and cumbersome is the hardtopwhich fails to turn the Stag into a refined fixed-head coupe because of atrocious wind whooshthat many have succumbed to rust while lying neglected in the gardenincubating snailsThe Stag is not a sports carnor is it especially fastany modern GTi hatchback will comfortably outpace it in a sprint from rest to 60mphWhat the Stag has which most modern cars do not is the endearing ability to amble quicklyto lope effortlesslyreeling in the miles without really tryingThatto meis its strongest suitDespite the intoxicating exhaust noisethe Stag is not dynamically excitingFar from itThe engine's lovelylugging delivery it is not all badyou seeserves as an antidote to frenetic drivingWhereas most modern performance cars encourage aggression through their virulencethe Stag suppresses it while getting there just as quicklyAnyone who is not relaxed and glowing with a sense of well-being at the wheel of a good Stag should keep their money in the building societyAge and mileage have little to do with values any moreCondition is what countsA concours
