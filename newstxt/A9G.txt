A Country DiaryMACHYNLLETHFor me a frequent delight in many years of hill-walking in Wales has been to come upon that livelyeye-catching bird the wheatear which so loves to play hide and seek among the rocksBut I have seldom got very close to these quicknervous birdsFrom a distance I have managed to see something of their spectacular courtship frolics that take place both on the ground and in the airand I have listened to their songs whichthough not rich in melodyseem just right for a world of cliffs and screesBut with such a wide-awake bird as the wheatear you will discover very little else about its private life unless you really get down to the jobAnd 40 years ago that is just what Peter Condersoon to be assisted by his wifePatset out to doHe has been gathering his facts on and off ever since and now they are available to us all in his book The Wheateara truly classic study of every aspect of the wheatear's lifestyleIt seems fair to claim this attractive book as a product of Wales because although the author lives in eastern England and has observed wheatears in many far-flung placesthe foundation studies were made on the Pembrokeshire island of Skokholm and Peter Conder has often returned there to keep fresh the memory of his pioneering researchesThorough in all its countless details his book is well written and easy to readits charm further enhanced by many true to life sketches made in the field by John BusbyThe publisher is Christopher Helmthe price Â£19.95WILLIAM CONDRY
