Leading ArticleStill a need for the big ideaBy MARY FAGANNEIL Kinnock and the party he leads are looking better than they have done at any time since he took office in 1983There will be ritual rebellion in Brighton from the Transport and General Workers Union over Labour's belated renunciation of unilateral nuclear disarmamentBut Ron Toddthe union's general secretaryis expected to concede defeat gracefullyEven if other antinuclear fundamentalists threaten to fightfight and fight againMr Kinnock need have no fearThe more firmly he tells them and the country thatas Prime Ministerhe and not they will rulethe more likely it is that he will eventually reach Downing StreetOn other issuescrucial victories have been won before the Labour Party's annual conference opensRelatively few influential activists would now quarrel with the recognition that markets are an effective way of generating wealth and indicating consumer preferencesFew want the wholesale repeal of industrial relations legislationEven the popular belief that the unions exercise too much power over Labour policies is gradually being accepted by a number of union leadersParadoxicallythe more moderate of them are insisting on the maintenance of their block votes because the party is still not fully democraticThey see themselves exercising the restrainingmoderating role they played in the 1940s and 1950sOnce one-person-one-vote is acceptedsome have already signalled a willingness to surrender much of their powerMr Kinnock hinted at the weekend that direct democracy was likely to become mandatory relatively soonTo list the opponents of Mr Kinnock's revisionist policies is to invite boredom and a sense of deja vu rather than any great fearThe electorate has long since rumbled Tony BennEric HefferDennis SkinnerKen Livingstone and the restThe prospect of Arthur Scargill entering Parliament invites mild derision rather than anxiety in the suburbsPotential Labour voters are coming to accept that an increasingly confident but mercifully less cockyNeil Kinnock has rumbled the fundamentalists tooand is neither impressed nor cowed by themIn his pre-conference interview this weekend the Labour leader demonstrated a restrained confidence and authority which is new andif it can be maintained in the heat of battlelikely to prove appealing to the sort of people whose votes he must winEven so there remain causes for concern in the Labour campYesterdayLabour's leader dismissed both electoral reform and pactsYet for Labour to win on its own at the next general election would be a victory on a scale comparable with that achieved by Attlee in 1945MoreoverMr Kinnock brushed aside the suggestion that he needed a big idea or unique selling point to challenge the appeal of ThatcherismHe went on to say that there was nothing at all from the last decade for which he could give Mrs Thatcher creditThe latter point was sillycoming from a man who has spent much of the last five years persuading his party that the world had changed since May 1979 and that there was no going backThe former is debatableMr Kinnock is a relatively recent convert to revisionismIf he can produce no grand reason for abandoning left-wing Labour attitudespeople will be forgiven if they conclude that the change was cynical and opportunistic and that Mr Kinnock is more interested in gaining office than in doing anything in particular once he has arrived at the topThis was not the basis on which Attlee reached No. 10 at the end of the war with a mandate to build a welfare stateWork-out with the trolley freaksBy MILES KINGTONDO YOU sometimes feel you should take more exerciseBut just don't seem to have the time or even the energyThen the answer is to combine a fitness

Â£179.99WarningNot suitable for shoppingLeading ArticleMorality and the marketBy MILES KINGTONTHE Friends of Thatcherism are working themselves into a fine old lather about the interview given by the Archbishop of Canterbury to the magazine DirectorThey regard the article as being primarily an attack on the Prime Ministerand one which is improper almost to the point of being constitutionalThey want the Prime Minister to use the Conservative Party conference next week to slap down this turbulent priestThey are wrong on all countsIt is the business of the head of the established church to express his worries about the state of the nation and the moral mood of the timesIt would be foolish and unseemly as well as counter-productive for the Prime Minister to enter into an undignified slanging match with him every time he does soIf Dr Runcie sees self-interestself-righteousness and an intolerant and uncharitable disregard for the unsuccessful and the unemployedit is not merely his right but his duty to speak outIffurtherhe feels that the free market policies and values embraced by Mrs Thatcher have done much to create a divided nationdominated by Phariseeshe should feel free to offer his opinionThis is nothoweverto say that Dr Runcie is correctIn so far as the interview is a critique of Thatcherism and that is not as far as might have been supposed from the headlines in yesterday's papers it is misplacedRulers do not set the moral climate of their nations exceptperhapsat the extremesHitler and Stalin debauched the moral climates of Germany and Russia respectivelyBut it would be hard to arguesaythat Greeks are less moral because of the appalling corruption of and greed demonstrated by senior figures in the government and party of the socialist Andreas PapandreouDr Runcie acknowledged that wealth creationwas the necessary precondition for doing all the things we ought to dobut added that there was no automatic connection between wealth creation and a happy societyAmen to thatMarket economics is about efficiencynot moralityGovernment can do much to set the boundaries in which it is possible to create wealthIt is for others to offer moral guidance to the newly prosperous PhariseesThe latter need not wait for a change of heart on the part of the Prime Ministeror the election of a new governmentbefore translating guilt about the condition of those less fortunate than themselves into actionThere are numerous worthy charitiesmany run by the church which Dr Runcie headsin need of donations of money or skillsIt is possible to loveand to aidthy neighbour without state interventionIf people are unwilling to recognise this it represents a failure of church leadership rather than political leadershipLetterFull-cost fees for studentsFrom Mr JONATHAN INGLESFIELDSirI refer to Peter Wilby's Viewpoint 29 SeptemberThe proposals for student fees hold especially worrying implications for the training of doctors in the UKI am 22but I will not be able to earn my first salary until I reach 24From that timeI will be obliged to pay off an ever-increasing student loanIt now appears thatin addition to thisI will be expected to part with a further portion of my income as a graduate tax to pay for my educationthe last three years of which I am spending in hospitalsnot only studyingbut assisting on a voluntary basis with essential clinical procedures and testsIt seems odd that I should be expected to pay for the privilege of assisting in this wayin particularas I doubt that these changes will alleviate the falling numbers of applicants to medical schools in the UKLetterFull-cost fees for studentsFrom Professor The EARL RUSSELLSirThe Vice Chancellors' proposal 29 Septemberto charge students full-cost fees will doubtless create protestsBut these protests should not be aimed at the Vice ChancellorsThey are undoubtedly right that it has now become clear that the Government will not pay for the expansion it desires at a level which will protect high qualityThough the powers of Vice Chancellors are considerablethey do not include the power to make two and two make fiveThey cannot deal with this situation by cutting qualityin a universityquality is the object of the exerciseand a university which sets out to lower quality is no more likely to survive than an army which sets out to lose its battlesFaced with a persistent excess of expenditure over incomethey may cut student numbers or they may increase incomeSince it seems they are not to be permitted to cut student numbersthey are attempting to increase incomeHoweverto say all other courses are impossible is not to say this course is possibleThe Vice Chancellors are looking for scholarships to meet these feesand money for those scholarships may come from governmentindustrybenefactors or private individualsIf the Government were likely to meet the full costthe proposal would be unnecessaryIndustry is in no position to undertake a surcharge on its costsand will probably replyas it has just done on the question of arts fundingthat industrial sponsorship is a supplement to government fundingit is not available as a substitute for itA record balance of payments deficit is not the right background for enforced increases in industrial costsWe lack rich benefactorsand the Private Sector Borrowing Requirementwhich last year had reached Â£200bn for mortgagesand Â£36.4bn for credit cards and hire purchase suggests that the private purse is no more inexhaustible than the publicThe plan to raise full-cost fees is likely to failThe problem will then return to the Government's deskand I hope it will then accept that the country can have no more universitiesand no more university placesthan it can affordLetterPolicy and politics at the Labour Party ConferenceFrom MR DAVID SOSKINSirI was interested by your juxtaposition of Poll predicts 42-seat majority for Labourwith Tories hold on30 Septemberthe latter referringof courseto the Conservative victory in Wandsworththe significance of which appears to have been almost totally ignored by the mediaElectors are always prepared to criticise the Government in answer to pollsters' questionsbut when the same individuals arrive at the polling booth they simply cannot bring themselves to vote Labour into powerLetterPolicy and politics at the Labour Party ConferenceFrom MS MOLLY MEACHERSirDespite a significant gap in the Labour Party's education and training proposalstheir objective to double the number of 16-18year-olds in full-time education must be welcomed 28 SeptemberEngland's full-time staying-on rate stands at 28 per cent according to the latest statistics availableThis compares with 79 per cent in the US86 per cent in Sweden45 per cent in West Germany and 69 per cent in JapanTo add the part-time education and training statistics to those figures does not improve our relative positionLabour hopes to transform the situation by increasing the number of A-levels to five for the brighter youngsters and providing grants for four-year training courses two years in a Further Education college followed by two with an employerfor the restThese reforms will only achieve their objective if accompanied by the implementation of the 1944 Education Act provision for compulsory part- or full-time education or training up to the age of 18This clause has never yet been activatedThe sharply reduced number of 16-18-year-olds will inevitably lead employers to bid up the wages of that age group to entice young people away from education and into unskilled or semi-skilled jobsEmployers must be required to release 16-18-year-olds for education and training for at least two days per weekOnly then will two vitally important and complementary goals be achievedto improve Britain's general educational and vocational competenceand hence our productive capacityand to reduce our gross educational inequalities between the elite who receive a narrow education to a very high standardand the restLetterPolicy and politics at the Labour Party ConferenceFrom MR JOHN PERTWEESirLabour does not need a commitment to proportional representation in order to scoop most of the centre ground at the next general electionAll it needs is to promise a high-powered investigationsuch as a Royal Commissioninto the practicalities of an alternative voting system surely justified by the intense public interest now aboundingSuch a promise would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voters and would have them flocking to the polls for Mr KinnockHis problem will be that Mrs Thatcher might decide to do it firstand then she will garner the votesLetterPolicy and politics at the Labour Party ConferenceFrom MR DENIS MacSHANESirIf Labour is to suggest the setting up of a specialist labour court 30 Septemberthen such a momentous change in the industrial relations system deserves more discussionand needs to be taken out of the hot-house of Labour Party conference politicsFor three reasons such a move should be welcomedFirstit would bring Britain into line with the best European practicenotably in Germany where localregional and federal labour courts handle problems in a fairdispassionate way based on lawprecedent and judicial expertise in the labour fieldSecondit would ensure that workers enjoyed positive rights under law and reduce the emphasis of union immunitiesLabour law will always reflect the balance of power in societyand a fully fledged labour court system will not remove class and fundamental employer-employee differencesBut it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rules to prevent the absurd see-sawing of industrial relations legislation we have seen since 1969Thirda labour division of the High Court would contribute to the process of constitutional reform in Britain which surely is to be a key political issue in the 1990sThe trade union questionwould cease to haunt the Labour Party and while that might upset some Conservatives it would be good for the countryLetterIndependence of no-fixed-abodeFrom The Rev NERISSA JONESSirOn Saturday you published an advertisement for the 10 extra pages of news and features that youThe Independentwill carry from 2 OctoberWhat do independent experts say about our 10 extra pagesasks the advertisementThe supposedly jokey answers are illustrated by photographs of people sleeping outside covered by copies of The Independentthey look like some of the hundreds of visitors who come to St Botolph's Crypt Centre for homeless people every dayGiven the already appalling and growing rate of homelessness and lack of hostel facilities in Londonwhen more people than ever will not only have to endure the freezing nights of the coming winter on the streetsbut perhaps permanent homelessnessit was terrible to see the situation being exploited for a joke by your advertisementJust the thing now the evenings are drawing inThe added coverage is exactly what I wantedHow much independencedo you suppose a person has who exists on the no-fixed-abode Giro of Â£34.90 a weekLetterEC immigration checks on trainsFrom The Rev J. GILMORESirThe contents of Sarah Helm's article Immigration checks to be made on trains25 Septemberare extremely worryingDuring the recent European Community elections the representatives of EC governments promoted the ideal of a border-free Europe by 1992Nowit would appear from this articlethat this ideal is shattered and a two-tiered Europe is on the cardsOne for those who travel by aircraft and one for those who travel by train between London and ParisThe presence of immigration officials and police on board trains is comparable to the scenes of 1930s America where migrant labourers were turned back at state boundariesWhat criteria would police and immigration officials use in their search for potential terroristson a train that they could not use at a static checkpoint or airportDo terrorists or illegal persons travel exclusively by trainThis is a clear example of the extension of the Prevention of Terrorism Act where criteria for stoppingquestioning and searching are purely subjective to the official involvedWill a person's accentdress or skin colour indicate the potential terrorist orfor that matterfootball hooligan or drug pusherThis is a recipe for fear and anxietyIt may mean the detention of innocent people and indeed their imprisonmentLetterCardinal sinsFrom Mr JIMMY DONOGHUESirThe North-east publishers of Viz are nearer the truth than they realise with their soccer strip 29 SeptemberCardinal Hume has not only the cross of being a fervent Newcastle United supporter to bearhe is also known to irreverent members of Mayfair's Jesuit Farm Street Church by his initialsGeorge Basil HumeLetterBruges and the future of a federal EuropeFrom Mr ALAN HASELHURST MPSirWilliam Cash letter26 Septembersuggests that democracy is at risk through our continued membership of the European CommunityHe even implies that those who sacrificed themselves in the Second World War are in danger of being betrayedHis distrust of federalism has to be very great to make such absurd claimsThe United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Rome of her own free willThose of us who helped constitute the large House of Commons majority in favour of the principle of joining the community did so with our eyes openWe actively desired an ever closer union of the European peoplesbut it was not laid down how and when this was to be achievedIt was a matter first of embarking on practical ways of increasing harmony and creating a single marketMr Cash is convinced he knows where this is all leadingI am not aware of any preconceived planProposals for economic and monetary union are just another phase of the journeyDoubtlessin timewe will consider adjusting the democratic framework to suit new circumstancesIn an interdependent worldthe inability of a national state to exercise effective control of its own affairs has long been apparentHow each generation of parliamentarians in member states will try to guide the community's political institutions will be for them to determineI suspect the evolutionary process will be lengthyMr Cash and his Friends of Bruges seem to want to fight a battle against federalism today which may not have to be fought at allIn any casewhat is inherently undemocratic about federalismThe Americans manage quite wellThe terrors which Mr Cash expresses about our future in the community have a familiar ring about themNationalists in Scotland say much the same thing about being part of the UKThose of us who want the Scottish people to stay in the UK can see nothing logically wrong or abhorrent in the UK developing its constitutional relationship with its community partnersFinally to cite the independence movement in Eastern Europe as the antithesis of what is happening in the community is the ultimate absurdityCountries such as the Baltic states hardly signed up with the Soviet Union as free agentsIt is small wonder that they want outOnce armed with that freedom they might surprise Mr Cash by also seeking membership of the communityLetterInexplicablelibel awardsFrom Mr ROGER COOMBSSirMarcel Berlins ' Good men and generous'Law29 Septembercalls the absurdly high awards made by juries in libel actions inexplicableThe most probable reasonconsidering the fanciful and irresponsible way the tabloid press operates these daysis a wish to punish newspapers for libel in a way that hurts and detersThis could be done more effectively if the law was changed so that it became the jury's responsibility to assess only the actual damage to the plaintiff and the judge's responsibility to impose an unlimited fine on the defendants according to his view of their culpabilityLetterPortrait of a nation's valuesFrom Dr BEVERLEY HALSTEADSirA nation's perception of itself and its values are reflected in the portraits on its banknotesOurs currently extol the virtues of Britain's response to the French Revolution Â£5remind us of our traditional relationship with Russia Â£10the danger implicit in teenage romance Â£20and the importance of our architectural heritage Â£50The withdrawal of the pound note with Sir Isaac Newton leaves no place in the nation's pockets for scienceWould it not be appropriate for this situation to be remedied by putting Charles Darwin on a new Â£100 note to emphasise to the worldin these uncertain timesour tradition of change by evolution and not revolutionLetterRecycling wasteFrom Professor R. A. SMITHSirYour reports today quite rightly praise the efforts being made in Sheffield to extract energy from waste and to recycle paperglassplastics and steel cansMuch as I wanted to read the good news on my walk home from the newspaper shopI was forced to concentrate on my footing on broken and delapidated pavementsstrewn with take-away food rubbishwrappings of all kindsand collections of weedsheaps of dog dirt and drinks cansIn a few weeks' timethe fallen leaves will have risen from ankle to knee deepIt is a wonderful thing to spend one's everyday existence paddling in a cesspool of untapped energyBOOK REVIEW Unhappy and gloriousChurchill's Black Dog-Anthony StorrCollins16 poundsBy MICHAEL CHURCHISAAC NEWTONFranz Kafka and Winston Churchill wereas infantsunited in common misfortunephysically puny and starved of parental loveeach was condemned to a lifelong wrestle with potentially annihilating depressionIn their achievement as adults each imposing his order on an external world he made his own they were united in triumphAnthony Storr's projectin this collection of essaysis to use psychoanalytical principles to show how in each case weakness produced strengthThe fullest and most fascinating case study is that of Churchillwhose famous Black Dogdepressions are shown to have sprung ineluctably from childhood traumasComparing him to Demosthenesin whom oratory compensated for a speech impedimentStorr juxtaposes two key scenesyoung Winston being pelted with cricket balls and hiding behind a treeand a slightly older Winston terrifying his friends and all but killing himselfby jumping 30 ft off a bridgeUntil the day he died Churchill kept a photograph of his nanny by his bedHis mother had had no time for himand his father disapproved of himAs Storr points outhe only felt entitled to love insofar as his deeds merited itdeprived of the totalirrational acceptance which loved children routinely enjoyhe was doomed to an endless pursuit of this ideal statebut never with any real hope of successThis cannot be accidentit must be designhe commented when at the age of 65 his great hour cameI was kept for this jobChurchill had at moments in the First World War manifested great strategic presciencehis intuition swung into action even more powerfully the second time roundRational judgement might have told him that the nation's plight was hopelessbut his was the vision of an avenging prophetIt is probableStorr observesthat England owed her survival in 1940 to this inner world of make-believeWhat psychoanalysis calls fantasies of infantile omnipotence thus came into playtogether with other attributes of infantility greedparanoiaand an inability to follow complex rational argumentsChurchill demanded that all ideas be submitted to him on a half-sheet of paperhe was frequently insensitivea bad judge of characterand a sucker for flamboyant charlatansintensely loyalhe demanded uncritical loyalty in returnThe end of the war meant the end of the blissful congruence between fantasy and realityand Churchill turned to painting and writing in an effort to regain that happy stateBut as Storr demonstrates with the aid of two stunningly beautiful passages from Churchill's early novel Savrolathe pen was better suited to delineating the bleak impotence he felt at his innermost coreFranz Kafka perfectly exemplifies the efficacy of art in counteracting emotional woundsif not in healing themHe felt powerless in the face of his fatherand was cursed with the unshakeable conviction that he was to be punished throughout life for some unspecified crimeAnthony Storr shows how these depressive fears were magically transmuted in the literary sphereKafka's gift to posterity lay not in any facile adumbration of the Nazi concentration campsbut in his ability to articulate terrors which we all have lurking in the recesses of our mindsNewton spent more time and energy on alchemical speculations than on the scientific discoveries which galvanised the Western worldStorr reconstructs the neurotic drive which impelled him to heroic intellectual featsLike Einstein he distrusted the senseslike many philosophers he was incapable of sustaining close emotional relationshipsand within his cloistered concentration miracles took placeI keep the subject constantly before meand wait till the first dawnings open slowly by little and little into the full and clear lightThis chapter makes heartening readingas does the entire bookChurchill's Black Dog may be marred by cut-price literary criticismand its construction may be slapdashbut its armature is a belief that people canby an act of creative willsave their souls at any stagethat fundamental personal change is possible after 4050even 60As our population grows olderthis is an idea whose time has comeWhat Kinnock must sayGiles Radice on the Labour leader's opportunity to set the political agendaBy GILES RADICENEIL KINNOCK'S speech at the Labour Party conference tomorrow will be the most important he has ever madeFor the first time since he became leaderhe is in the position to set the political agendaAs he prepares his texthe might recall Harold Wilson's speech to the 1963 Scarborough conferenceAfter 12 years in powerthe Tories had run out of steamWilson's task was to project his party as an alternative government and associate Labour with the agenda of the 1960sHe succeeded triumphantlyHis white heatspeech not only demonstrated that he was aware of the scientific revolution that was changing Britain but also associated Labour with efficiencymodernisation and planningLabour won the 1964 election and was in power for 11 of the next 15 yearsAs in 1963so today there is a strong sense that the tide is turningBut the Tories still have time to recoverespecially if they jettison some of the more unattractive aspects of ThatcherismMr Kinnock's job at conference must be to demonstrate Labour's electability by confirming the party's new revisionismby reassuring voters on issues where there is still doubt andabove allby helping set the agenda for the 1990sThe party has abandoned policies which made it unelectable in the 1980sIt is no longer the party of traditional nationalisationit is no longer anti-Europeanabove allit is no longer unilateralistMr Kinnock must stress the extent to which Labour has really changedDefencewhich lost Labour so many votes in 1983 and 1987is especially importantHere Mr Kinnock should set out clearly whyin the Gorbachev eranegotiated rather than unilateral disarmament is almost always preferableOn the economythere is still work to doPolls show thatdespite impressive performances by John Smith and Gordon Brownmany voters still believe Labour is a party of high taxation and inflationBut there is strong support for sensible increases in public spendingprovided this does not lead to massive hikes in taxationThe party has to emphasise thatin contrast to the Toriesit believes public spending should rise in line with growth in outputbut that it will pursue responsible fiscal policiesLabour's hand on inflation would be strengthened if its leader were able to announce that it now supported early British entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary systemMr Kinnock will also have to clarify several confusions in policyHe should repeat his assurance thatwhile Labour is opposed to the privatisation of water and electricity and wants to see a return to public controlit is not the party's intention to clobber those who buy sharesMuddle over trades union legislation must also be cleared upUK employeesamong the least protected in Europeneed more extensive statutory rightsBut that does not mean the repeal of all Conservative legislationnor that unions should be immune from penaltiesIt is essential that the modern Labour Party should not be in hock to the unionsBut perhaps Mr Kinnock's most important task next week is to look forwardLabour's acceptance of the market strengthens the increasingly powerful case for government intervening selectivelyThe classic example of market failure is environmental protectionEducation and training and research and development are other areas where government intervention is badly neededThe dilapidation of our transport system and the shoddy state of our national services underlines the argument for more public investmentLabour's change of policy on the European Community puts it in a strong position to argue that economic and industrial decisions are increasingly likely to be made on a European basis and it is essential that Britain plays a more constructive roleWe shall need to developfor examplea viable policy on economic and monetary unionAt the time when Poland has its first Solidarity prime ministerHungary is to have free electionsand Britain is fed up with Mrs Thatcher's authoritarian styleLabour should be seen to take democratic issues seriouslyI am disappointed the policy review has adopted such a negative attitude both to a Bill of Rights and electoral reformA new agendacentred on citizens' rights and democratic reformselective government interventionenvironmental protection and a more positive role in Europe would provide the basis for a new progressive majorityIt must be Mr Kinnock's task this week to capture this new agenda for Labour and set the party on the path to powerDisturbingly quiet on the Western frontBy WILLIAM REES-MOGGTHE HISTORIC roots of culture are extremely deepI can remember sitting at Professor Hayek's feet in the company of Margaret Thatchera fellow discipleYet I do not doubt that Aristotle and St Paul have done more to frame the Prime Minister's mind and therefore the destiny of her Government than any thinkers who have been dead for less than 1,900 yearsThe great dead have framed our cultureour culture shapes our political lifetherefore the great dead have shaped our political lifeIf one wants to explore the possibilities of Europe's political futureone needs therefore to examine the development of European cultureI have tried to focus such an examination by playing the parlour game of making a list of the 50 Europeans who have most influenced the consciousness of Europe in the last 1,000 yearsSuch a proceeding isof coursearbitrary to the point of being ridiculousI have excluded from my list politicians as such hence the absence of Napoleon but have allowed in Lenin and Hitler because they largely invented their own ideologiesI have no doubt excluded towering figures who ought to have been includedand included some less importantTo have found no space for ScottKantGibbonPushkinCopernicusBoylePopeNietzsche and Racine will seem to many to have been an impertinenceFrom the lists I madeI came to feel that European culture in the last millennium may have had some 100 real heroesthe mastersingers of Europeof which I have tried to identify halfHoweverat least 10 of my cultural heroes would appear on almost all listsand perhaps 30 would appear on mostNobody could deny the place of MichelangeloShakespeareNewtonMozart or Voltaire in the firmament of European cultureI was surprised by two conclusions that came from making such a listI had not expected the twentieth century to show such a steep decline both in numbers and in qualitythough I was less surprised to see the cultural importance of the nineteenth centuryI was also surprised to see how great the Germanic contribution to European culture had beenNo doubt one could easily design a more Francophone listbut with nine Germans and three Austriansthe German-language contribution was close in number to the 13 English-language and outnumbered the eight FrenchIn this field there are two common ideasof which one is true and the other is falseThe true idea is that Italy is the cradle of European civilisationItalyas the centre of the Roman worldconveyed the classical idea to a barbarian EuropeRomeas the site of papacypropagated the faith of the Catholic ChurchDown to the end of the fifteenth centuryItalians dominate European culture in literaturein sciencein scholarshipin painting and in architectureThe Renaissance is an Italian phenomenon which spread to the rest of EuropeThe false idea is that French culture took over the leading position of ItalyThat was divided between BritainGermany and France and the other nations in more or less equal proportionsBritain probably made the greatest contribution in literature and scienceGermany certainly in musicwhile in the late nineteenth centuryFrance dominated the world of paintingThe enlightenment was split between France and ScotlandThe Netherlands provided ErasmusRembrandt and Van GoghJudaism produced MarxFreud and Einsteinnone of them Orthodox but all influenced by Jewish cultureSpain provided two saintsout of a total of fiveI was sorry to leave out Thomas Morethough he was clearly a less important European influence than ErasmusWhat is horrifying is the decline in our own centuryAgain I am suspicious of my own bias of tasteI am not a modernistthough I presided at the Arts Council with liberal equanimity over the public funding of much modernist art which I did not understandYet in other centuries I was being forced to omitfor sheer lack of spacefigures of the highest cultural importanceThere was no room for Haydn or Hume in the eighteenth centuryfor Verdi or even Dostoevsky in the nineteenthExamining the twentieth century was like having to apply a quota to allow the underprivileged into collegeIt is also true that the twentieth century list contained more than its fair share of abnormal personalitiesThe general impression conveyed by the earlier centuries is one of wisdomharmonyhumanityNot perhaps in the cases of Wagner or Rousseaubut in the general run of Europe's cultural heroesIn the twentieth century only Einstein and Stravinsky have undamaged personalitiesthe others are in varying degrees diabolicalmadbadneurotictragic or agonisedThat has not prevented them exercising a great influence on our cultural developmentThey are also all deadThere is no twentieth-century master who belongs to the second half of this centuryEurope experienced in the first half of the twentieth century a simultaneous culturalspiritual and political breakdownThe political breakdown was manifested in the two world warsin the Holocaustin the severity of the slumpin the doctrines of Nazism and totalitarian communismboth of which were a defilement of human natureThat breakdown was reflected in the art of the periodwhich as in Francis Bacon partly protested and partly rejoiced in the excremental quality of the ageNow all is quiet on the Western frontThe European mind has no great spokesmanThere are philosophersbut no great philosophercomposersbut no great composerpoetsbut no great poetpaintersbut no great painterAfter the storm of the breakdownEurope is in a period of convalescenceperhaps sedated convalescenceYet at least the storm does seem to be overand the peasants are picking up fallen sticks in the devastated forest50

communist China's 40th birthday partyBy ANDREW HIGGINSAt a distance the only vantage allowed anyone except soldiers and carefully vetted civilians it could almost be the Goddess of DemocracySculpted from white plaster like the students' statuethe new monument has been erected on the spot where the democracy movement's impertinent icon of defiance stood until the People's Liberation Army arrived on 4 JuneFor the few considered politically reliable enough to get a closer lookthere can be no mistakeThe 25 ft statue marking the 40th anniversary of the People's Republic of China is an altogether different creature from its smashed predecessorFar from mimicking the Statue of Libertythe new statue holds a gun not just any gun but an AK-47the weapon used by the army to blast its way into PekingIts barrelpointed by a helmeted soldieris sticking into the chest of a worker in overallsA peasant stands next to thembehind is a bespectacled intellectualTiananmen Square may have been handed back to the peopleaccording to Peking's mayorChen Xitongbutas the statue makes clearreal power comes not from the people but from the gunIn an unsubtle reminder of the importance of firepowerDeng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders gathered in Tiananmen last night to celebrate the 40th birthday of new Chinawith a deafening display of pyrotechnicsFor more than an hourrockets exploded across the sky an extravaganza that for many Peking residents recalled not so much the glory of the revolution as the tracer bullets and machine-gun fire of early JuneIf the Goddess of Democracy symbolised a vision of China alien to the Communist Partythe new figures are equally alien to the studentsthe obedience of the intellectual and unflinching solidarity of the workerspeasants and soldiersIronicallyneither of these visions is ChineseWhile the students looked to the WestChina's hardline leadership has found its inspiration in the pre-glasnost Soviet Union of Stalinist aesthetics muscular armssquare jaws and stiff posesThe official blurb explains that the plaster figures stand as if boldly forging aheadtheir eyes fixed on our motherland's beautiful futurePerhaps unwittinglythe new statue hints at a deeper truth underpinning the hardline triumphthe workerthe peasant and the intellectual gaze wistfully towards the Forbidden Citythe grandest monument to the genius of Chinese civilisationbut the soldier has his eyes fixed in a different direction down the Avenue of Eternal Peace towards Zhongnanhaithe walled compound where party leaders live and workFor as Mao decreedif power grows from the barrel of a gunit is the party that must controland if necessary usethat gunFour months after the People's Liberation Army stormed central Peking with the loss of hundreds of livesfew can have any doubt about the party's determination to enforce this Maoist maximAs many as 100,000 soldiers are still encamped around PekingSoldiers stand guard on street corners and roam the city at nightOccasional gunshots can still be heardthough no one seems to know who fires the guns and if anyone is hitThe leaders remain haunted by the forces of dissent they ordered the army to crushAcross China there has been a ritualistic cleansing to erase the symbols of the student movementNoticeboards have been scrubbed clean of posterswalls of daubed slogans and minds of memories of what really happenedImitating the students' tacticsthe party has ordered shops and houses be strung with banners praising the great and glorious Communist Party of ChinaAndagain like the studentsit has issued an official list of permitted slogansordering citizens to memorise 40 different chants to mark the 40th anniversary of communist ruleNot as stirring as the protest movement's shouts of long live democracydown with autocracythey include cumbersome chants hailing the great achievement of socialismand warmly hail the victory over the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellionNowhere has the leadership struggled to exorcise the memory of the student- led revolt as in Tiananmen itselfthe symbolic heart of the nation whereon 1 October 1949Mao Tse-tung proclaimed the People's Republic of ChinaThe students who occupied the square for three weeks in May and early June have been banishedSotoohas anyone without the special pass needed to get through military cordonsThe Monument to the People's Heroesthe stone obelisk in the middle of the square where student leaders had their command centrehas been declared a forbidden zone because it is felt to have been contaminated by the students' presenceIn an attempt at gaiety before the national dayfairy lights were strung on trees where political banners and cartoons lampooning the leaders once hungThere is no doubt now who controls the squareChina's leaders have become so fearful of revolt that Tiananmen is guarded round the clock by uniformed soldiers with guns while the rest of Peking remains firmly under martial lawScores of Tiananmen's paving stones have been replaced to remove the evidence of anti-government messagesOthers have been covered with flower pots to hide the traces of the student occupation or scars left by the tracks of tanks and armoured personnel carriersTry as the leadership might to erase what happenednothing can be done to change the one fact on which the future of China turnsthe men who ordered the assault on Tiananmen Square will surely die long before the youth they ordered to be killedDeng Xiaoping is 85and while apparently in reasonably good healthwill not outlive the instigators of the counter-revolutionary rebellionOther veteran revolutionaries on whose longevity the current leadership depends are all in their eightiesSomelike the hardline godfather Chen Yunare so infirm they are rarely seen in publicOthers do occasionally venture out but are painful to watchAt a state banquet on the eve of the national day in the Great Hall of the Peoplethe head tables were cluttered with ageing revolutionaries slumped in their seatsWhen Li Pengthe Prime Ministertried to share a toast with his adoptive motherthe venerable widow of Chou En-laihe was met with an uncomprehending stareIn desperationhe finally raised not only his own glass but also hers a graphic reminder of how fragile the veterans'and by association Mr Li's ownpower may turn out to beBut if they are physically weakthe old guard remain politically strongRefighting the battles of their own youththey have tried to fix China's eyes firmly on the pastThe party may claim to be in the vanguard of historybut its clock seems to have stopped in the 1950sPropaganda campaignsclass strugglethe cult of the model worker and even the almost evangelical rhetoric of the cold war are all back with a vengeanceTelevision and newspapers no longer praise model entrepreneurs but heroic labourers such as Zhang Fuxinpraised for throwing himself into a pit of polluted mud to retrieve a piece of equipmentPeople are told that Mr Zhang was so dedicated that he cut short his honeymoon to return to worktelling his new wifeOne day without hearing the sound of the drillmy heart is heavyOne day without wearing work clothesit's as if I lack somethingI feel ill at easeIn deference to ageing stalwartsthe Communist Party's new leaderJiang Zeminrecently made a pilgrimage to Yenanthe remote village where the Red Army took refuge at the end of the Long MarchThe future of Chinahe pronounceddepends on reviving the Yenan spiritof hard work and plain livingSo strong is the nostalgiathat MaoChou En-lai and other founders of new Chinaoften seem to have returned from the deadThe front page of the People's Daily and every other major national newspaper last week featured a picture of the new Politburo standing committee meeting with actors from a People's Liberation Army theatre troupe made up to look like the dead founding fathersMao lookalikes also dominate the cinemaThe country's best known Mao impersonatoran actor called Gu Yuehas made a startling comeback in a new 90-minute epic portraying the last months of China's civil warIn a further nod of respect to the great helmsmanhis portrait on the Forbidden City has been given a new lookAlready replaced once in June after being splattered with paintit was replaced again last week with a new painting featuring a bluer skyIn Peking at leastthe resurrection of past models and heroes has provoked more giggling than respectspawning a rash of political jokesTake for example the peasant who visits the mausoleum housing Mao's corpse in Tiananmen SquareWhere is MaoI want to talk to himhe says to the guard at the doorYou can't talk to himhe's deadreplies the guardAfter touring the mausoleumthe peasant returns and again asks where he can find Mao aliveAgain the guard replies that he is deadThe peasant then walks past the corpse for a second time and emerges to ask the same questionI told youhe's been dead for yearsthe guard snapsI knowthe peasant answersbut I just love to hear you say itAnother joke is about a student marching down the Avenue of Eternal Peace with a banner saying Li Peng is a pigThe student is arrestedtried and sentenced to 20 yearsHe complains that illegal protests carry a maximum sentence of five yearsYesreplies the judgeFive years for an illegal protest and 15 for revealing state secretsSuch is the mood of quiet irreverence and anger that street hawkers have begun selling buttons with the two-finger victory sign that became the symbol of the student movementAs an ingenious precaution against charges of counter-revolutionarytendenciesthe buttons carry a small legendVictoryI climbed the Great Wall of China
