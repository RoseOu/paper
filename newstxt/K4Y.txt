The Great Pretenders Gulbenkian Studio TheatreNewcastleTHIS production is the British premiere of a 17th Century work by the Spanish playwright Lope de Vegabut any assumptions we may have that it will be a genteel period piece are dispelled with the first few lines of dialogueOpening with a tirade of four letter abuse from Roman footsoldiers to their absentleadersthe translation by David Johnston for The Gate Theatregoes on to incorporate a great many deliberate anachronisms which give the play a decidedly modern flavourThe first act accounts for only one third of the two-and-a-quarter-hour running timeand details the series of intrigues whereby Diocletian John Straitona common legionaryascends to the position of Caesar following the murder of his predecessorAureliusHaving effectively established the background of decadencesavagery and corruption that was Rome in 300 ADthe play shifts gears after the interval for the arrival of a travelling theatre company which is to present an entertainment for the newly installed EmperorAfter a good deal of broad mockery of the group's thespian pretensionsthere follows yet another change of tack as the troupe's hitherto self-absorbed leaderGenesius Louis Hilyerconverts to Christianity and is martyred for denouncing the oppressive regimeGroups of actors have often provided the focus of stories about the victimisation of innocents by totalitarian forces examples include To Be or Not to BePrivates on ParadeThe Last Metro and the recent Spanish film AyCarmelaso it's interesting to see such a relatively early variation on the theme as thisBut the affectionate satire of outrageously hammy theatricalsthough amusingstrikes rather a hollow note when so much of the company's own work is stridently self-indulgentIn particularJamie Newall's Aurelius would make Tod Slaughter seem a model of subtle understatementhis declamatory performance in Act I is barely distinguishable from the deliberate badness later onHilyer whose character is apparently the Patron Saint of actorsishoweverexcellentwhile Rae Smith's idiosyncratic costume designs and the lighting by Paul Russell also make very effective contributions to an uneven but often rewarding eveningMusicon ConcertSt Mary's CollegeDurham SIRITSU is a group of four young musicians devoted to the performance of music of Spanish and Bolivian originparticularly that associated with the silver mining town of PotosiIt wasperhapssomething of a disappointment to find that they were all from Britain and thatthereforethe genuine folk background was lackingThose who have heard Andean groups performas they have done locally in recent yearswould miss their primitive and earthy flavour in this Saturday night performanceNeverthelessit was a thoroughly enjoyable evening with some excellent musicianship displayedThe music generally alternated between sophisticated 16th Century Spanish pieces mostly of a sacred characterwith delightful singing from Sara Stowe and able accompaniments on recordersharpguitars and hurdy gurdyand native material of Bolivian originalbeit with Spanish conquistador influence evidentUsing genuine folk instruments such as armadillo charangospan pipes and caja and playing them splendidlythe group built their programme around the Bolivian seasons and the ritual divisions of the yearThey attempted to demonstrate how the Spanish influence was absorbed into the Andean vision of the world and they achieved considerable successThe audience responded enthusiasticallyIt was an unusual and intriguing eveningTommy Chase Quartet Arts CentreDarlington IT'S BEEN three years since the Tommy Chase Quartet last played in Darlington and in that time the other players have changed completelyTommy is still obviously the leader and driving forcevery much in the Art Blakey mouldand once again he's selected a group of talented young playersFor this tour the final line-up had Dave Lewis on saxesLes Miller double bassand guitarist Chris Watson who replaced the previously announced Hammond organistDarlington was only the second date on the tour and got off to a bad start with a trip from Manchester through freezing fog arriving late and coldDespite the slight delay the audience gave the band a rousing welcome and were rewarded with two superb setsIt's hard drivenbut Tommy is unmistakeably a jazz drummervery crisp and energetic and clearly leading the groupDave and Chris indulged in a little showmanship but this was backed by some great playingTenor sax and guitar played well together and in their many solosDave also played the old fashioned curved soprano saxwhich looks almost like a toy instrument but it sounded clear and forceful in his handsMost of the material was written by the band but it still sounded very much in the traditionAmongst many outstanding numbers was a tribute to Bobby Timmons based on Dis Here and a very bouncy SummertimeThe tour continues up and down the country

in ballet are outrageousErotic scenes in a new version of Swan Lake coming to Darlington Civic Theatre are set to ruffle a few feathersaccording to a top criticFor Jeffery Taylorarts correspondent for the Mail on Sunday claims the Northern Ballet Theatre has gone a touch too farAt the weekendafter a day spent watching the company rehearsethe former professional ballet dancer described its performance as having more to do with the pelvic thrust than an arabesqueBut his comments caused outrage at the Civic Theatre where the directorMr Bryan Goddardtook the unprecedented step of taking out an advert to counter the claimsIn the announcement Christopher Gableartistic director of the NBTsaid he was astonished a rehearsal could be so misunderstoodI give my personal guarantee that this production of Swan Lake will be as magical for children as it is for adultshe wroteMr Goddard said the Civic had taken many phone calls on Monday and Tuesday from parents worried the ballet would be unsuitable for their childrenI was able to reassure most of thembut there was one lady who we could just not convince and she cancelled a group booking for 50We have already sold 87 per cent of our tickets so we think it should be a sell-out despite this articleMs Anne Izzapress officer for NBTsaid she had fielded about 300 calls as a result of the Mail on Sunday's articleWe have had a major PR job on our hands with the schoolsBut it's a classical version of Swan Lake that will offend no child and no womanin fact nobody at allWe had 22 teachers in here last week watching the same rehearsal because their children are doing a project on it and as a result of that we have had 260 kids watching the rehearsal this weekThey don't find it in any way offensivein fact they say it is beautifully doneMr Taylorwho trained at the Royal Ballet School with Mr Gable at the age of 16defended his report when he told the D & S on WednesdaySTRONG IMPACTChristopher Gable has no stronger supporter than me but his new scenario for Swan Lake is aimed to shockIt says it aims to clarify the story a doubtful claim and to make a strong theatrical impactwhich I am sure this production will doIt is going to cause the purist and the traditionalist to raise their hands in horrorThey are not writhing around like a Soho sex show but it is outrageous compared to the traditional performance of Swan LakeThe Northern Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake has its world premiere at Leeds next SaturdayIt comes to the Civic Theatre in Darlington on March 31A SCULPTURE from the National Garden Festival is set to get a permanent home in a Durham City parkAioncreated by sculptor Hamish Horsley out of Portland stone and slatewas one of the largest and most prestigious exhibits during the event at Gateshead in 1990It was commissioned by British Rail which has now offered it to Durham City Council on permanent loan as part of the improvements to Wharton Park which overlooks the main East Coast Railway lineThe council is proposing to site the statue which measures nine metres by five metres by two-and-a-half metres on Windy Hillone of the highest points in the parkwith the Cathedral forming a backdropDirector of technical services Ken Swales is recommending the city's amenities and leisure committee to accept the offer from BR and seek planning permission to erect the statueHe said the statue was well received at the Garden Festival and had been wanted by many local authoritiesIts donation by BR to the council would represent a major coup for the cityhe saidThe acquisition of such a high quality contemporary sculpture can only enhance the city's reputation as a centre for modernas well as historicartistic and cultural worksAdditional landscaping will be provided to assist in the assimilation of the sculpture into its parkland settingThe committee will be told that the artist would be involved in moving and resiting the work which is being stored in DarlingtonIt is expected this will cost the council £8,500 though this could be offset by a grant from Northern ArtsThe council hopes to unveil the sculpture in Environment Week in MayMusic meetingThe Recorded Music Group is

Trio from Norway must rank among the very bestTheir Saturday evening concert at the Arts Centre showed them to be individual artists of the highest quality who together produced something greater than just the sum of the partsThis quality was at its most sublime in Schubert's marvellous E Flat Trio with which they endedIn it they brought just the right weight of balance to each partto each phraseto each noteIts effect was a magical transparency of texture yet with depth and solidity where neededWith this class of playing the listener is led to a conviction that at last there may be in due time successors to the distinguished Beaux Arts Trio indeedin their approach and enjoyment of the music they play there are parallelsEarlier a trio by their fellow countryman ValenOpus 5 in E Flatseemed to derive much from Schoenbergian romanticismintense and impassioned yet it lacked a variety of paceMarvellously playedthe work might well yield more on a second hearingAn andante con oto by Greig was

Schnitzler's Reigen is perhaps best known under its French title and as the first of two film versionsmade by Max Ophuls in 1950is remembered as the quintessence of Viennese eleganceYet both original film and play were widely unavailable until the early Eightiesdue to copyright problems and the author's insistence after a public outcry had kept the playcompleted in 1897off the Austrian stage until 1921that it not be produced for fear of his intentions being betrayedAccused in its time of being a scandalous affront to bourgeois moralityLa Ronde in fact pinpoints its hypocrisy most acutely and in retrospect reveals its author as among other thingsa perceptively premature feministIts plot is a circle of loveas a succession of couplings begins with a nocturnal encounter between a whore and a soldierand continues as the soldier has sex with a housemaidthe maid with her young masterthe master with a married womanand so on until we reach a count who returns us to the whoreEach of the ten matings the lights black out at the crucial momentsof courseis a vignette illustrating the transience of human relationships and the inequality which exists between uncommitted sexual partnersas passionlovelust and power are unevenly distributedinvariably resulting in unhappinessA more obvious underlying meaningpointed out by the programme notesis to see the round-danceas a metaphor for the transmission of VD ormore topicallyAIDSbut this seems to me less interesting than the social satire whose delicate emotional nuances preserved in co-director Ceri Sherlock's modernised adaptationgive the play its wider significance and melancholy humourVictoria Scarborough and Colin Watsontaking five roles apieceprove adept at giving every character a distinctive individuality while subtly stressing the continuities which make each the mirror image of one another 's frailtiesThough it lacks the grace and fluidity of Ophuls' film laborious set-changing is necessary between each scenethe

produce sparks as soon as they went on stage with a determination to take Leo Fender's finest to their limitsThe band have a live intensity that's missing on their recordings and gave added depth to

a few cancelled bookings for children and Darlington Conservative councillor Peter Jones went on Radio Four last weekcalling for it be banned from the Civicwhere it is due on March 31Coun Jones had been urging Darlington councillors to stop the production coming to the town sayingIf the borough council can ban something like the Chippendalesthen it should have no hesitation of stopping a soft

gave a five minute standing ovation at the end of the two-hour performanceAfter taking their bows the cast met Princess Margaret backstageChoreographer Dennis Wayne declaredPrincess Margaret said we were brave and that the production had come offShe seemed to enjoy itI have no regretsThe problem with ballet is it alienates people because it is cultureBut it is notit is entertainment and it is for the peopleThe performance does almost as much to acrobaticscomedy and theatre as it does to ballet but that is not to say the dancers don't use their technical expertise to the fullLynne Connorof Leedscame with her two childrenten and 13 year olds Joanna and JennyAfter reading reports about the balletshe was worriedBut I came down to the theatre and was assured it was suitable for children so

expecting a traditional productionI did not realise it was a new production but I'm very impressedMargo Hawesof Horsforthsaid she had been coming to the ballet for yearsI'm either very naive or there is nothing to take exception to at allThe performance took the audience from gasps of fear as dancers were thrown up in the airto laughter as a roller skating bear entertainedI did not expect the humour but I liked itsaid Alma Coxof LeedsThe acrobatics were marvellousThe whole ballet is really goodEarlier Northern Ballet spokeswoman Anna Izza insisted that the production was not an attempt to shockThere is an exotic dancer who you could sayin modern termsis a strippogram but it is actually set in 1870s Russia so she is an exotic dancerShe does not take off all her clothing as some people have been led to believeMs Izza said the love scenes were quite sensuous and in some parts possibly eroticif your scale of erotic goes that lowbut nothing that is overtly sexualNorthern Ballet director Christopher Gable saidI am not trying to shockI believe that if you are honest in the theatre the audience will be thereArtur PizarroRichmond Georgian Theatre THIS weekend has provided music

heard the renowned Janacek String Quartet and in Richmond the Portuguese Leeds Piano Competition winner Artur PizarroThe latter's Richmond subscription concerts recital in the Georgian Theatre opened with Liszt's large scale B Minor SonataThis immense work requires from the performer a breadth of vision and sense of construction to unify its disparate parts together with a consummate techniqueAll these were present in Artur Pizarro's performanceControl over the full range from thunderous chords to glittering passage work to a mere whisper of a pianissimo was totalThis was a performance to rememberone of seamless continuity of musical thoughtNor was there any flamboyant gestures from the pianistjust a stillness and controlled technique that let the music speak for itself throughout the eveningThe Seven Poetic Waltzes by Granados were marvellously poised and contrasted with the same composer's extrovert Concert Allegro that succeeded themTurina's Three Fantasy Dances are brilliantly

of the Sixties British film renaissancein the fleshUnlike CourtenayFinney is not yet wearing his character like a glove and as this was the very first public performance perhaps we shouldn't be expecting him tooRare is the production these days that lets critics in without the benefit of at least half a dozen previewsHarwood's tale of brotherly love tooby its naturechanges into a different gear in its second half after an opening act in which the Manx brothers we have not been on speakies for ten yearslook poised for a reconciliationAlfred Finneyand Michael Stephen Moorehaven't spoken since the former took the latter to court over a play called Family Matters which exposed the skeletons in the Manx cupboardMichael tells the world the family secrets in the name of artis how his brother sees itNow Michael has written a new stage play Brother Mine whichas the title suggeststells of two brothers named Nicky and Freddie whose resemblance to the real thingas we see as the piece is acted out for Alfred's approval in the second actMichael looks on his new play as a celebrationAlfred views it as crucifixionHarwood has things to say not just about families and brothersnot missing the chance to poke sly fun at the loveybehaviour of actors and the nature of playwrighting itselfAs Alfred tells Michael when he pleads Brother Mine is an act of confession and conciliationIf you want to cleanse yourself go have a bath and don't use me as your bar of soapAll this the play not the soapis wrapped up with a fair degree of barbed wit with Finney acting big and bold as

production runs until SaturdayAN AFRICAN band as old as their country perform at Darlington Arts Centre tonightThe Bhundu Boys from Zimbabwe began playing together in celebration of their country's independence 11 years agoThey took their name from the bush guerillas who fought with Robert Mugabe during the bloody war of independence and blend high energy guitar with subtle Zimbabwean rhythmsRise Kagonafounder of the groupsaid the birth of Zimbabwe acted as the floodgate to inspiration for the bandWhen you have been oppressed and let free you are like a bird out of a cageYou celebrate and wander around and see what you have been missinghe saidThe bandforced to play covers of Beatles songs and American country music the staple diet of Rhodesian radioimmediately switched to traditional African songs written specifically about celebrating freedom and living together in a new countryA lot of African music was outlawed in RhodesiaThe only way you would get on television was to play songs in Englishsaid KagonaBut a lot of African people could not understand EnglishTheir popularity soon grew and the introduction of World Music to the West during the late 1980s catapulted the band to international recognitionShabinirecorded in Zimbabwe in 1987shot to the top of the indie charts in Britain and the Bhundu Boys began to gather momentumPeople are still coming to see Zimbabweand it is the same with us we used to see England as this tiny blob on the map and now we can see it for ourselvessaid KagonaThe band are one of the few African groups to maintain any kind of success outside their own countrydue largely to the efforts of their managerThere are many good bands in Africathey all want to come abroad but it is difficult to get visas and many promoters are only interested in doing just one tourWe have been successful because our manager has really wanted to explore with us and work togetherThe Bhundu Boys have recently played a few dates in Spain and have toured in AustraliaAmerica and EuropeWith the sad death of their bass player David Mankaba behind themthe band are promoting their third LPAbsolute Jitand hope their colourful music can bring a ray of

Association organised conferences and courses throughout the country from its headquarters in DarlingtonThe board of managementled by Newcastle man Dermott Killiporganised a variety of programmes in a bid to stimulate interest in the artsBut the agency ran into trouble when sponsorship funds became increasingly difficult to attract and management were forced to call in the liquidators earlier this monthThe associationwhich operated from Darlington Arts Centre in Vane Terracehas debts of almost £30,000Liquidator John Taylor saidThis association fell victim to the lack of sponsorship partly as a result of the present economic situationWhen the company reached the point where it couldn't meet its liabilities I was called in to wind the business upMr Taylor said the agency had a particularly close working relationship with several local authorities throughout the countryThe Arts Development Association was formed in April 1990 to promote and develop the artsAs well as organising conferences and courses the group also helped set up a national awards scheme and backed a number of arts publicationsTOP folk musicians will be heading for Darlington next monthThe Arts Centre is

constant vigilance at future exhibitionsEstimates have now been obtained to install a closed circuit television systemWhen Durham Theatre Company's Stephen Rawsthorne asked Steve Chambers if he was interested in adapting D.H.Lawrence's Women In Lovethe playwright had to stop and thinkI was alarmed by the riskIt's likeWellyou've done a lot of hill walkinghow do you fancy hang glidingI'd not done an adaptation before and my fears grew with the first reading of the booksimply because of the enormity of the taskRawsthorne had clear reasons for wanting to tackle Women In LoveThe four main characters come from a mining communitybut they've left it behindHe saw a parallel with Durham's situationwhere mining is being taken awaybut it still dominatesLawrence's themes are universalhoweverChambers sums them up ashow to live your life in the 20th century and remain sane and happyAs he explored the territory of the bookhe was drawn into it more and moreLawrence came from where I come fromHe was a sickly child with a bad chestso was I. He was brought up by womenso was I.His preoccupations seemed to be ones that I understandI am very interested in the history of my own familyin the kinds of people they became and whyFinding out about my history was finding out about Lawrence's context and vice versaAll of that is very excitingAlthough not something he had thought of himselfthe adaptation grew in importance to himthe more he worked on itIn factit's been one of the most exciting things that I've worked on and it's certainly changed my careerHe means this in a number of waysbut most importantly in the very practical sense of the range of opportunities open to himFirst I was pigeon-holed as a youth writerthen as a writer of comedies for adultsNow I'm someone who knows all about Lawrence and Lawrence is ArtHe's currently developing a play about Lawrence's experiences in the First World War and he's been asked to look at Lawrence's novel Kangarooby the BBCIt's like you get on to a listhe suggests with a smileI really enjoy Lawrence's questionsI don't necessarily agree with his solutionsbut his philosophical concerns are relentlessly modernthe problem of sexual lovethe problem of sexual relationshipsand all of it enfolded by the problems of industry and the environmentTo Lawrencethe world is intrinsically a beautiful placeyet we will turn it into filth to get a smaller and less beautiful object out of itThe play opens with two nights at the Arts CentreDarlingtonon Wednesday 26 and Thursday 27 February before touring the Northern regionNorthamptonshire and NottinghamshireIt returns to finish the tour at Darlington on Saturday 28 Marchafter which Stephen Rawsthorne will be leaving Durham Theatre CompanyIT was not without a frisson of excitement that Ridley Scott's Oscar nomination was greeted in the NorthEastThis was not necessarily as great as the frisson of excitement which comes from watching his jolly exciting films but it should not be disregarded for all thatScottfrom South Shieldsis one of the five men nominated for the Best Director Oscar for his gripping work Thelma and Louisea violent female buddy buddy movie labelled waggishly as Bitch CassidyHe is the only person in this year's list from the North-East of EnglandThis was not one of life's big surprises and actually it set one to wondering if he might be the first ever since the whole shamelessglitteringaddictive business began back in 1927He is notWith some help from film buff Tony Hillman it can be revealed that Scott has been preceded by Charles LaughtonFlora Robson and Anthony Havelock-AllenLaughton came from Scarborough and while his best known film role was probably The Hunchback of Notre Dame he won his Oscar in 1932–33 for The Private Life of Henry VIIIHe was also nominated for Witness For The Prosecution some 25 years laterDame Flora was from South Shieldslike Riddersand was nominated unsuccessfully for supporting actress in Saratoga Trunk in 1946Anne Baxter won for The Razor's EdgeAnthony Havelock-Allen is from Darlington and collaborated with David Lean on some his great filmsBoth Brief Encounter and Great Expectations which A H-A producedwere nominated for Best PictureThe latter which he co-wrote was also on the Screenplay shortlistThusif Ridderswho went to school in Tynemouth and Stocktonwins next month against the oddshe will join a select band of oneFor some reason probably ignorance of the comic artWill Haythe majestic Thirties comedian who also went to school in Stockton was overlooked by the AcademyWHY would Darlington Civic Theatre want the internationally-acclaimed English Shakespeare Company to bring its Macbeth to the townYou might think it would be for the prestigethe culture or simply because enough people are interested that all three performances are sold outBut the real reason the bar takingsAnd if there are no bar takings then there will be no future performancesWhile we appreciate that art must go hand in hand with commercewe wonder how many theatre goers realise just how much depends on their half-time gin and tonic and choc-barDROPPING your aitches is something of a crime if My Fair Lady is anything to go byand the game that her fair ladyship the Queen was playing in last week's Echo Memories had indeed committed that crimeThe plea for information about alma had hundreds of people scurrying for their dictionarieswhere they soon realised that the game in question did in fact go under the name of halmaTo start at the very beginningas Pamela Hine didthe game or sport of halma was part of the ancient Greek pentathlonIt was a long jump competition where the athletes did themselves no favours at all by carrying weightsThe Greek word for jump is halma andas any linguist extraordinaire will knowthe French have the word hallesthai meaning to leapAnd so to more modern timesIn the 1880s halma was rejuvenated as a board game Waddington's-style for two to four playersThere were 256 squares on the board and each player had 19 or 13 piecesThe object was to get your pieces from your corner to an opponent's corner by leaping over his piecesA bit like chess played diagonallysaid one correspondentor a four-sided game of draughtssaid John MortimerWith four players you could have quite a battle in the middle of the boardJohn Lowe remembers halma as a forerunner to bingoCircular discs with numbers on were pulled from a bagthe numbers shouted out and when your card was full you leaped to the top of the houseThe game washe saysillegal because it was a form of gamblingBut Mr Lowe agrees with Joe Corrie who remembers playing halma of whatever description in the TwentiesSince then it seems to have died outNOT only does the woman in the new Spennymoor town centre sculpture look like she's sitting on the toiletand the greyhound look like a ferret or a sausagesomeone said but when they went to erect the blessed thing last week it didn't fit the space availableLocal stonemason John Willetts had to be called in that's another billhe confirmsfor Sedgefield District CouncilA PRODUCTION of Macbeth has run into hubblebubbletoil and troubleover plans to run it without an interval in Darlington next weekCivic Theatre director Brian Goddard says the internationally acclaimed English Shakespeare Company will have to make up the money for lost barice cream and coffee salesHe has accused them of artistic arroganceby refusing to have a break in the two-and-a-half hour performanceESC founders Michael Bogdanov and Michael Pennington director and star of the Shakespeare tragedy say they would rather stay away from the Civicone of the strongest dates on their world toursthan face the same problem againThis is the first time anywhere in the world this has happenedNot having an interval isn't a problem in Korea or Japansaid a spokespersonFuture English Shakespeare Company visits to Darlington are being jeopardised because bar takings are downThe interval row has been simmering since ESC informed Civic management two or three weeks ago that the production would be played non-stopMr Goddard wrote back accusing Bogdanovacclaimed as one of Europe's top theatre directorsof artistic arrogance and threatened the ESC would be unlikely to play Darlington again if an interval was not put inWhen Bogdanov refusedMr Goddard said he intended to charge the company at least £1,650 to cover lost salesThe ESC said yesterdayIf it was a choice between £1,650 and not coming backwe would decide not to come backMr Goddard was equally adamantWe budget that we will take so much in sales during the interval and it's a significant amount of money to loseWe have to consider the economic as well as the artistic aspecthe saidHe refuses to accept ESC's argument that Macbeth is usually played without an intervalAs far as I am concerned there is no justification for not having an intervalIf they insistwe want our moneyAll three performances of Macbeth at the Civic are already sold outBut there are tickets left for the ESC's other production Twelfth Night next week and that does have an intervalDIRECTOR Stephen Rawsthorne and writer Steve Chambers had clear ideas what they didn't want to do in turning D.HLawrence's novel Women in Love into a stage playWhat Rawsthorne calls the Nicholas Nickleby modelin which narration is part of the dialogue and exchange between stage and audience was outRather he wanted to encompass the spirit and essence of the Lawrence book for a modern audience in a play in its own rightHe opted for Women in Love because of its mining background and the fact that the story focuses on four charactersa suitably economic cast for a small-scale touring companyHe also wanted to get away from having four actors to play 33 charactersI find that a bit stiflinghe saysGreat fun to watch but a logistics exerciseThe playwhich opened at Darlington Arts Centre last nightconcentrates on the relationships between school's inspector Rupert Birkincolliery owner Gerald Crichteacher Ursula Brangwen and her artist sister GudrunVisually the production contrasts the harshness of pit mechanisation with the softness of the sensuous clothingWhich brings us to sexRawsthorne points out that Lawrence is more about sexuality than specific acts of sex which account for only two or three sections of the 600-page novelHe also disputes popular opinion that Lawrence badly treats women in his novelsWe believe but maybe we would because we are men that he is as critical of the male sexual psyche as the femaleAs far as he knows Women in Love has not been adapted for the stage beforebut already it is causing much interest from other theatres and companiesDetails of tour dates is available from Durham Theatre Company on Roll

tripCHRISTOPHER Gable says he did not set out to deliberately shockYet he was well aware that tampering with the traditional approach to Swan Lake would ruffle a few feathersWhat he wasn't expecting was a Sunday newspaper preview article claiming Northern Ballet Theatre's new staging of Swan Lake was steamyerotic stuff with a hint of oral sexMore dirty duck than sensual swan was the impression givenThe result of this advance publicity not wildly accurate as it turns out spelt potential disaster for NBT which prides itself on making its work more accessible to youngstersWorried parents fretted that their children would be exposed to X-rated happeningsA Darlington councillor whoof coursehadn't seen the production called for it to be bannedThe threat of cancelled bookings hung in the airBackstage at Leeds Grand Theatrea few days after Swan Lake's royal premiere elicited a five-minute standing ovation from the audienceGable talks long and intelligently about the controversial productionYou'd expect the unhelpful advance publicity to make him wary of the PressNot at allHe has operated an open doorpolicy since taking over as NBT's artistic director and will continue to do soIf people are going to have their opinions formed by what they read in the tabloidshe feels sorry for themA relatively simple question like Are you a happy manone assumes he must be in the wake of the successful openingis followed by a 15 minute answerGable replies that to be honest he's surprisedalthough not by the attitude of the old guard conservative group of three or four London reviewersTheir reaction was predictableOne expects them to groanthough I don't know quite why we should be seeing a piece as it was performed 50 years agoThat's what they think ballet should be and that's why I thinkby and largeballet is a dying art formWhat has surprised and pleased him is the public's responseHe wasn't sure how they'd take to this rethink of Swan LakeFrom the letters he's received and through talking to audienceshe knows the production is a popular oneJust don't use the word crowd-pleaserGable regards this as an insult to the audience handed out by critics who consider themselves on a higher levelThat NBT audiences and critics are out of touch would seem to be borne out by the response to NBT's recent touring hit Romeo & JulietWorst production of the yearwrote one London criticBest of the yearvoted readers of Dance and DancersI was not sure what the general public's reaction would be to Swan LakeEveryone knows the name and thinks they know the storyI presumed they would be bringing very formed expectations to the theatreWhat I've found is a far younger element in the audienceOn the evidence this production is speaking far more vividly to this generation than the traditional versionGable hopes his Swan Lake will be viewed not as a version but a theatre event in its own rightAlthough I don't try to shock I do try to make the moment as vividly alive for the audience as I can and that's a sort of crusadehe admitsHe's moved the story to Russiasent the Prince on army manoeuvres where he joins a boys' boozy night outhas the swans massacred by a power-mad crippled usurper and the corpses piled obscenely in a heapWorst of allthe swans don't wear tutus but rather fetching white corseted little skirtsNBT audiences are not content to look at rows and rows of identical girls doing the same thinghe maintainsGable justifies his changes with talk of Tiananmen Square killingsthe murder of the Russian royal familyAuschwitzHollywood parties and even Prince AndrewThis may sound extreme in print but Gable considers it legitimate stuff of the theatreHe saysI simply tried to do what I observed in my career in the straight theatre with some of the finest directorsparticularly Peter BrookI tried to make the story as individual and as real as I canand if possible to approach without any preconceptionswhich is hard with Swan Lake because I have been associated with the ballet for 14 yearsYou can't just make a performance of everything you have seenYou have to clear away the debrisI did with thislooking at various segments of the storyHe's proud that Romeo & Juliet introduced children to both Shakespeare and Prokofiev in a way that makes them think it's not culture and a bit boring and I wish I could go and watch NeighboursChristopher the Crusader is in his stridethe man who reckons this generation of youngsters is deprivedThey may have more toysgames and TVs per room than any other generation but lack the stimulation of readinglistening to music and the radio of Gable's youthIt seems to me that what our children have got is a little square box with predominantly soaps and games showswith fingertip control to get them from one to another as they get boredThere is no stimulus for the imagination and like any other muscle it can atrophy from lack of useGable is honest enough to acknowledge that there's some truth in the saying that no publicity is bad publicityThe cynical and worldly part of me tells me it's been wonderful because the production must be the most talked about in 20 years of danceOnce the production opened and the showed the allegations were totally groundless we are left with a production that parents know is suitable for children and no one can take that publicity awaySwan Lake plays

away from London fearful that the capital's theatre critics would tear it to piecesOut-of-town audiences were greatly amusedSo much so that a theatre fireman laughed so loud that he fell overaccidentally rang the firebell and brought the curtain down prematurelyDespite that successthe playwright had difficulty raising the money to bring the comedy into the West Endalthough the backer

attitudes will deter a modern audienceOne has to remember it's a costume playWe are not pretending it's taking place todayA lot of it is charming because the way of speaking and attitudes of people in those days now becomes an amusing factorI think that's why the play has survived so long because it has this peculiar charmThe prospect of 16 weeks on tour doesn't especially fill Cargill with

Shakespeare Company's forthcoming performance of Macbeth at Darlington Civic Theatre looked set to fall victim to the play's unluckyreputationFor when the company announced there would be no interval in the 2 7hour production and refused to change their mindsMr Brian Goddardtheatre directoraccused them of artistic arroganceAnd as the squabble boiled overthe company threatened never to return if the theatre pressed for lost bar takingsestimated to be £1,650A spokeswoman for the ESC defended director Mr Michael Pennington's decisionIt's a short play and its very hard to find a natural break in the actionunlike some of Shakespeare's other worksThe action goes along at break-neck velocity to reach its conclusion and so there is no problem with the audience fidgetingBut on Thursdaythe council's recreation committee ruled that Mr Goddard's claims for compensation should be shelved in the name of artistic integrityCoun. Mrs Dot Longcommittee chairmansaidMr Goddard has acted perfectly properly in his negotiations with the ESC in his efforts to maximise income for the Civic Theatre in the present difficult economic climateOn this occasionthe recreation committee considers the artistic integrity of the production should take precedence over economic considerationsIn a statementMr Goddard said the ESC had apologised to the theatre for any inconvenience caused by not telling them earlier that the play would run without a breakThe Civic Theatre and the ESC have agreed to wait until the end of the week's performances and then to evaluate the amount of income taken before any further discussions take placehe saidWe wish to stress that our discussions are proceeding on amicable terms and there will be further visits to Darlington Civic TheatreMr Robert Smallwooddeputy director of the Stratford Shakespearean Centresaid academics had disputed the question of doing without an interval in the play for yearsIt really is a contentious areahe saidSome productions of Macbeth have one and others decide not towhich is artistically good but commercially dubiousThe problem is that the structure of the play shows no sign of what Shakespeare intended at allThe play's three performances next week are sold outthough there are tickets left for their production of Twelfth Night which does have an intervalTheatre fans complain of poor bar service and lack of leg roomComplaints about the bar service and leg room at Darlington Civic Theatre featured prominently in a questionnairecouncillors heardMr Bryan Goddardtheatre directorsaid staff would keep looking for ways to improve the bar serviceincluding encouraging people to order beforehandAnd applications for grants from arts funds had also been madeHe said the surveywhich attracted 499 replieshad shown that some people experienced problems getting into Signor Pepi's BarComplaints about the coffee bar had already been dealt with by adding shelves and tables near the Borough Road entranceOther patrons complained about the lack of leg roomespecially in the dress circle and the front row of the upper circleHe said he had written to everyone who had included an addressexplaining that the problem in the dress circle was due to the original structure of the theatreIf each row had been widenedone row would have had to have been removedmeaning the new front seats would have been higher than health and safety rules allowedThis would have meant putting a safety rail across the front of the circle across the sightline of other members of the audienceWe decided to go for restricted leg room rather than restricted visionhe saidThe report also showed that 320 of the 499 who replied had visited the theatre more than four times in the last yearCoun.

people with physical disabilities enjoy electric keyboard musicThe bookSwitched Onpublished in 1990is now in its second edition having sold over 15,000 copiesThe idea of my book was to encourage students to become more and more interested in music and composing by giving them first-hand experience of keyboardshe saidMr Biermann spent eight months convalescing after the strokestaying with his motherAnne Biermannin Elton RoadDarlingtonand running a music course at Williams music shopLast Friday he presented copies of his books to Darlington Borough CouncilHe is also presenting books to

anklestorn ligamentscrepe bandages and walking sticksHigh Scorers ConcertDarlington Arts Centre THIS concert looks set to be come an annual event in Darlington's musical calendarThe participants are those young people who have passed with high honours in the Associated Board of Music examinations during the preceding sessionOn Saturday they were invited to play one of their examination pieces to an audience which consisted mostly of parents and friendsbut with a sizable number of outsiderswell wishers allThe acquisition of a new Steinway Grand piano by the town stimulated the idea of allowing its use by and for the younger generationThe success of the project was evident at the first concert last yearThis yeargratifyinglythe number taking part had doubledso that two sessions had to be heldIt was really a most heartwarming occasionThe range of instruments represented violincellodouble bassfluteoboebassoonrecordertrumpettromboneeuphonium and of coursepianoplus an eloquent young singer lent an infinite variety to the programmeThe playing throughout was excellentin some cases superband always movingCredit for the resounding success of this venture goes to Mrs Mavis Robson the local Associated Ward Secretary whose organisation was exemplaryThe future of music in Darlington has a promising glowLe RueRedcar Bowl AFTER the standard blues fodder from support band Sinister Footwearthe style of cajun rock purveyed by Le Rue was well worth waiting forDespite the infectious music and Pierre Le Rue's exhortations to the audience to rise from their seats and come towards the stageprecious few did soThat left plenty of room for those wanting to let themselves goLe Rue the band are one of the tightest and most cohesive units I've seenIt would be hard to fault anything they did and although the unit bears the fiddle player's nameevery member of the band was given his own chance to add a little something to the songs under Pierre's subtle method of musical directionLe Rue the man doesn't let his talents stop at the violin and vocal duties with the band as his guitar-playing provedThe mixture between cajunbluegrass and boogie styles was almost seamless and all gained from the five musicians' vigour and enthusiasm for the songs they were playingPierre Le Rue may not have mega sales or an exceptionally large following behind himbut the combination of the band's musical ability and his stage presence made for a very enjoyable eveningI wouldn't hesitate about going along to another of the band's gigs whereit is to be hopedthe audience would give more than a round of applause for the amount of hard work put into the showThe PoppyfieldTHE boys have got some new toyscourtesy of winning The Northern /Mardi Gras talent competition a while backand they have twiddled every imaginable knob while re-recording two live favouritesBut among the bare rhythm tracks are some truly uplifting tunes thatwithout stretching the realms of credibility too farare worthy of comparison to New Order at their most ecstaticUntitled Composition No 1 now features some great vocal effects and an enormous electronic orchestra to emphasise the grandsymphonic melodyCitiesdespite its carefree chorus and gentle synth linessuffers slightly from its lengthy technoish rewritebut is still an excellent songSINGER Gemma Wilson from Newcastle has a lovelyeasy voicenot unlike Debbie Harry's during the gentler moments of Parallel LinesHowever the presence of nearly rap-vocalist Ken Sakamoto from Tokyo will cause Hug to be compared to the SugarcubesWhateverMesmerised is a really prettycatchy perhaps even poppylittle tuneThe bsideShatter Meis slowermore intensemore Pixies-esqueand like the a-side is interspersed with inventive tape cut-upsThe 12 inch carries two extra tracksProcessionTHESE Hartlepool lads throw everything into this two-track demoand end up sounding like early Eighties' pop combined with touches of Nineties' hardcoreThere is no doubt that they have some excellent musical ideas but at the moment their efforts are a little unfocussedOr perhaps it's just the mixTreading Water is a frantic trackpowered by pumping bass and chinking rhythm guitarwhereas Harlequina possible singleopens with a slab of techno keyboards and ends up with a guitar soloThe songs are goodand Procession are not afraid of immersing themselves totally in their musicbut perhaps a more measured approach might be worthwhileNo vigilantes in the Dales vigilantes ready for lorriesEcho February 19has the ring of high dramaIt also has rather unfortunate connotations of self-styled guerrilla activists prowling the Dales ready to plunge daggers into the tyres of quarry wagons at night or to fire catapults at drivers daring enough to run their gauntlet during daylight hoursOf courseI would have few grounds for complaint had the words attributed to me been my ownHoweverI must stress that the word vigilantein fact never passed my lips during the interview conducted by your reporterWhile I am happy that our efforts to keep more heavy traffic off the roads should achieve front page prominenceI am not so keen that so

AbbotchairmanThe Wensleydale Railway AssociationELSIE CLOUGHTON74-year-old musician who plays piano and piano accordion at events throughout DarlingtonI've been playing the piano and the piano accordion for about 60 yearsI first started when I was seven and a halfI suppose I was influenced by my father who used to sing and tell stories at concert parties he ranI was brought up in a different era where you had to entertain yourselfIf you had a talentyou were recognisedand often I got invited to play for the local Boy Scout groupI still sing and play some of the material that my father used all those years agoThey are particularly popular when I play in front of old peopleDuring my weekI play at a number of keep fit classes around DarlingtonI've been playing at the classes for around 40 yearsI was first asked to play the piano at a local youth centre by a lady called Gladys MutimerIt was her that invited me to play for a keep fit classI now play at classes in Mowden Junior School on a Monday evening and at Abbey Road Junior School on a Wednesday eveningA class for the Over 60s at the Dolphin Centre in Darlington takes up my Tuesday afternoonwhere I play the pianoIt's quite nice because the people at the classes come to hear the music as well as to keep fitOften they ask me for requestsand sometimes they will come over and ask about a piece of music I've just playedAt the classes I usually play lightmodern and rhythmic musicA lot of younger people enjoy music like 42nd Streeta new musical in my daybutof courseit's still around todayI don't just play tunes at keep fit classesI used to run an English and Scottish dancing class at the old high school in Cleveland Avenuebefore it became Hummersknot School in 1955 where I worked for 22 years

demonstrations of dancesuch as Morris dancing and country dancingThere are also demonstrations of different kinds of musicI used to play for the Darlington Deanery Choir one afternoon a weekWe used to go along to various churches in the area playing musicFor about four yearsI was involved in weekend courses at Rayhead and Lanton Castle Adult Education Centres and more recently at Beamish HallAt one courseI was playing for experts from the English Folk Dance and Song Society in LondonI used to go along to Greenbank Hospital's geriatric wardswhere I sang and played to the old folkA friend of mineAudrey Walkerused to come and involve the patients in some gentle exercisesAt the momentI do quite a few barn dancesmainly for wedding anniversariesI try and provide a good selection of musicand

key role of Young Walsingham in their latest productionBut while Half A Sixpence has a budget of £35,000the best any Young Walsingham can expect to received is three penceSecretary Bill Jones saidWe are after someone about 6ft tall who is good looking and very well spokenIt doesn't matter if he can't sing because Young Walsingham doesn't utter a noteAs an added inducementthe society is offering

English Shakespeare Company's new version of Macbeth ventured along to the opening night of the old romantic favourite Twelfth Nightapprehensive at what was in store this time aroundBut they were not disappointedThe familiar Twelfth Night everyone knew and loved was just that along with a fine performance by the English Shakespeare CompanyMost outstanding of all was Jenny Quayleas Violawho searches for her long lost twin brother in IllyriaDisguised as a page boy albeit an incredibly feminine one she enters the service of Orsinowith whom she falls in loveBut the path of true love never did run smooth and who could blame Orsino for overlooking this waif-life creature with the shortdarkcropped hair for the Countess Oliviashe of the long flowing hair and dressesCountess Oliviawho recently lost her brother and fatheris now in deep mourning and has vowed to live like a recluse for seven yearsAllie Byrne gives an enjoyable performance as the cool countess who is attracted to Viola now known as CaesarioThe scenes with the two together are among the most passionate and amusing in Michael Pennington's productionBut Olivia's seriousness is in direct contrast to the meddlesome

with the club business and the regular draw for a cash prize of £100After the free buffet a cookery demonstration by Peter Bellsenior lecturer at Darlington College of Technologybegan with the preparation of the ingredientsAll went well until about half way through the demonstration when fumes from some hot oil wafted into the smoke detector above the hob and set off the hotel's fire alarmBelieving the demonstration to be the cause of the alarm there was little reaction from the members attending the meeting and the Mr Bell continued despite the noise from the alarm bell in the corner of the roomAfter a few minutes a barman came in and asked everyone to move outside with the other hotel guests who had been evacuated from the buildingBy this time two fire engines and a police

Charley's Aunt is in its 100th yearthis production starring Mark Curry in the title role is as fresh as everSet at the height of Victoria's rulethe story revolves around three Oxford undergraduates who have nothing better to do than court young femaleshave parties and be awfully brassicOf course upper classnothing but Victorian convention guides their whims and wishesAnd cynical but obedient man servant Brassett Nick BaylyBrandon Thomas's play reflects the social propriety that meant young ladies were always chaperoned in mixed company even to a lunch party such being in 15 minutes time wasn't thought unusualThat's where Charley's Aunt was supposed to come into chaperon the swooning sweeties Kitty and Amybut a last moment delay left Jack and Charles desperateChristopher Lamb Jack Chesneyand Jonathan Markwood Charles Wykehamset the opening scene rather woodenlyand the play didn't lift until Lord Fancourt Babberley Mark Currywas bullied into his amateur dramatics costume to be the long-awaited auntDonna Lucia D'AlvadorezThe anxious student in strange female dress jittered at any provocationCurry played on that sense of panic when intimately caught with the money-grabbing Spettigue Patrick Cargillor the more civilised Sir Francis Chesney Frank Windsorwho eventually found his long lost love when the real Donna Lucia did arriveOccasionally Curry used panto dame slapstickrather than emulating the sophistication of a wealthy millionaire widow fresh from Brazil where the nuts come fromportrayed sympathetically by Gabrielle DrakeAnd Thomas had Ela Delahaythe companion to Donna Lucia and earnest love of Babberleyfor fate to act kindly on the poor boyThe farcical element throughout was datelessshowing how the Victorians could laugh at their own

qualities that the McCapra String Quartet brought to their Darlington Music Society recital in the Arts Centre on Saturday eveningFrom the first bars of Mozart's HuntQuartet it was obvious that their effortlessly fluent and natural playing was at the service of artistic integrityTheir sense of balance between the sublime and robust in Mozart's music was impeccableIf Mozart is the essence of

resulta smaller than average audience was there to hear Bobby's current bandHis last appearance in Darlington was about three years agoand since then this quintet has been formed with Jez Hall on tenor saxNikki Iles on pianoGary Culshaw electric bass and Tony Faulkner drumsThe rhythm section provided a perfect cushion for the soloistsspringy and supportive but never obtrusiveNikki's solos were delicateusually starting in the middle of the keyboard and moving steadily higherbut alsowhen neededshe provided a bouncier sound as on Bobby Timmons' This HereJez Hall's tenor sax sound is lighter and warmer than Bobby's providing just enough contrast in their many solos but also doubling mellower than before but still with a cryingkeening sounding that taps enormous depths of feelingThe programme included several original compositions such as C.U.C.B.dedicated to Clifford Brown with Glasgow connotationsand The Promised Landa tribute to Al Cohn and Zoot SimsMost moving of all was Duke Ellington's In A Sentimental Mood in which Bobby's solo was plaintive and heartfeltThe balance and sound for this concert were superb with every note clearly hearmaking it a totally enjoyable

the chance to veto controversial exhibitionsBut Labour committee chairwoman Dot Long says Coun Stenson is on very dangerous groundShe argues it is not the council's job to act as a censor and people who are likely to be offended do not have to see the exhibitionStolen Glances features pictures by ten lesbian photographers and has been at the council-funded Arts Centre for two weeksPhoto montages include a lesbian woman added into pictures of film stars Audrey Hepburn and Julie Andrewsa series of shots about a Gay woman's experience of developing multiple sclerosisand a picture of two

Stenson went to the show himself on Saturday after receiving several complaints and believes the pictures should be removed before the closure date of April 25He fears unsupervised children could see the more controversial picturesHe saidI am not discriminating against lesbiansI think this could corruptwe have to be careful about what we have in our townIf they want to show things like this they should show it in privateCoun Long said she shared Coun Stenson's concern for children and emphasised the Arts Centre brochure of events said the exhibition was unsuitable for youngstersIf children did visit they should be with an adult who could explain the pictures or stop them from seeing the more controversial onesShe said people did not have to view the show if they were likely to find it offensive and while she found some photographs disturbing they should still be shown so people could form their own opinionsMore than 80 comments on the exhibition are included in the Arts Centre

Ruth Geiger who started her week-long North-East tour in Sunderland Art Gallery on Tuesdayis an extremely fine artisteHer recital for the Sunderland Piano Society began with a performance of Haydn's Andante and Variations in F Minor in which firmnessconsistency and a sense of ease allowed the work to expand and develop naturallyA similar overall vision was apparent in Schubert's A Minor Op 164 SonataHere in the slow movement she allowed the gentle principal theme to flow naturally and above all musicallyIn the finale the abrupt changes of pace were contrasted to always good musical effectLeos Janacek's On An Overgrown Path is very much a work of atmosphere and impressionsIts course of ten short sound pieces are like an aural snapshot albumeach one conjuring up visions in the hearer's imaginationHere they were played with affection and an aware responsiveness to Janacek's uniquely personal musical language that createdin the later works of the group particularlyan intensity that belied their relative brevityThe different impressionism of Debussy's La Terace des Audiences de Claire de LuneGeneral Levine and Jardins Sous la Pluie ended a recital that was notable

LakeDarlington Civic Theatre CAN'T see what all the fuss was about reallyThis was the production that was supposed to have had simulated sex and a strip-o-gram plus a rollerskaterI caught the rollerskating bit but am afraid the rest of it must have passed me byThe Northern Ballet Theatre company production is far from controversial and provocativeIt's sensualyesand passionate but did not deserve the criticism that it was soft pornInstead it is a superb adaptation of the much-danced Swan LakeArtistic director Christopher Gable has injected it with a new lease of life and brought it to a completely different audienceIt's hard to fault the production as it has everything from passion to drama to sadness and comedyIt was refreshing to hear the audience actually giggling at the humour and the NBT shows that ballet can be funFull marks go to the costume and set designersVisually the ballet is a treat to the eyeThe costumes are vivid and colourful with a distinct Russian feel while the sets are highly imaginative yet subtleThe dancers all showed a great joy in their work as they danced to the rousing Tchaikovsky score and special mention must go to lead dancers Victoria Westall and Antony HarithEven the most veteran balletomane cannot fail to be moved by the production and the dying swan scene at the end brought a few tears in the audienceThe production continues at
