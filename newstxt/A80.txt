towering central defenderJohn Williamsas a striker but Sunderland held onTwo injury-ravaged sides understandably lacked precision and poise but Gabbiadini was always direct in his approach and it was appropriate that he should give Sunderland the lead six minutes before the intervalHe snatched at the ball inside the Bournemouth penalty area andthough confronted by four defendersenterprisingly

publicPSYCHOLOGICALLY the Aztecs were probably better prepared for the invasion of Cortes than Irish rugby is for the arrival of the All BlacksTwo undistinguished international seasonsonly token involvement with the Lions in Australia and bitter controversy about South Africa have combined to give the game in Ireland possibly the worst public profile it has hadThe visit to South Africa of several eminent Irish Rugby Football Union officers and their wives among them the presidentRonnie Dawson triggered off an acrimonious debate which looks likely to run on in spite of an IRFU statement regretting the safariThe union's promise that no Irish team will be allowed to go to South Africa whilst the remainder of the apartheid laws existhas not convinced many peoplewhile drawing the wrath of their recent hosts down about the heads of Dawson and his fellow-travellersThe IRFU's South African links have been criticised in the pastnotably when Ireland toured there in 1981 amid a storm of public and governmental condemnationNow those critics have been joined by what entrenched IRFU committeemen may regard as the Enemy WithinFor the Irish rugby schools and clubs have loudly condemned the IRFU whichthey saypurports to represent them yet made no efforts towards consultation before participating in the South African Rugby Board's centenary celebrationsThe absence of Dawson or any deputy from Ireland's recent tour to North America has also been deploredThis courtesy might not be necessarystrictly speakingbut the fact that All the President's Men were in South Africa as guests of the SARB at the same time was not a helpAnd the IRFU did nothing for its cause by not awarding caps for the matches against Canada and the United States and by refusing to pay the players the regulation daily allowance because the tour was one day short of the stipulated durationSo the union and the game are held in low esteem at presentAndin the battle for sporting hearts and mindsIrish rugby simply cannot afford that unhappy situationIn terms of mass appeal rugby comes fourth after Gaelic footballhurling and soccerMany believe that playing standards will improve only when more young players are attracted to rugbywhich means getting them into the clubs at youth levelButif and when Jack Charlton brings the national team to the World Cupevery boy in the country will be kicking a soccer ball aboutBut that is in the futureAt present the advent of the All Blacks is concentrating the national rugby mind wonderfully and all four provinces have been in early-season actionMunsterthe only Irish team ever to defeat the New Zealandersdrew with Glasgow and District and overwhelmed PontypoolLeinster did a similar demolition job on Llanelli and lost narrowly to the South-west DivisionUlsterthe reigning inter-provincial champions and the most consistent province over the past five seasonsenjoyed an easy win over the Scottish SaltiresBut Connachttraditionally the weakest of the provinceshad a disastrous startlosing heavily to Glasgow and District and also to the humble Scottish North-Midlandswhose victory was their first for seven yearsThe inter-provincial championship went to Ulster for the sixth consecutive yearand Munster have shown good formBut realistically it is hard to predict anything other than a 100 per cent success rate for the All Blacks in IrelandThe international at Lansdowne Road in 10 days could be traumatic for Irelandwhose only successes since January 1988 have been achieved against weak opposition whichoddly enoughincludes Wales at the Arms

first impression of Mick Quinnthe former international fly-halfwasThe omens are not goodThey train harder than we playA good international season is essential if Irish rugby is to regain lost

form is all Chinese to the average punterFOR THE second Wednesday running racing from Hong Kong will be screened by SIS in the betting shops this afternoonwith Southwell's all-weather fixture again appearing to be cold shoulderedwrites Chris HawkinsSIS will also be covering KelsoNewbury and greyhound racing from Bristol so the need to give punters the opportunity to additionally sample delights from the orient hardly seems necessaryThere has been some sharp criticism in some areas of the sporting press principally on three countsThat the turnover generated does not contribute to the levythat it is a snub to the all-weather experimentthat it is pure exploitation of the punterTerry Ellisracing director at SISanswered these points for me yesterdaycommentingFirst of all it is factually incorrect to say that the turnover is not subject to levyAll horse racing isI cannot understand how that misconception aroseSecondlythe decision to screen 16 Hong Kong meetings between now and the end of March was taken last year before firm plans about all-weather racing had been drawn upOur yearly schedules are finalised in October by our users committeeWe covered Lingfield's inaugural all-weather meeting because that simply replaced a flat fixture scheduled for that daySouthwell's all-weather meeting last Wednesday was not on the original fixture list and neither is today'sbut we will be covering meetings there on November 14 and 21 because there were ordinary jump meetings already scheduledAt the turn of the year we shall cover every all-weather fixture at Lingfield and Southwell in addition to the usual turf fixturesThe third point that we are merely exploiting the punter is unfairAlthough the major bookmaking firms are represented on the users committeethey were originally not keen on Hong Kong because it meant bringing in extra staff in the morningsBy arrangement with the sporting press we are providing full racecards and form for Hong Kong so punters are hardly betting blindAnd in any casethe punter has the final veto no one forces him to betThis is true but Hong Kong form means nothing to the average punterIt is like looking at the menu in a French restaurantEllis declined to say how much the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club is being paid for the servicebut this is not money which British racing is missing out onas a contractsubject to review after three yearswas drawn up with the Racecourse Association at the beginning of SIS transmissionEven sothe decision to cover Hong Kong has now been overtaken by developmentsThe rapid strides made on the all-weather front really makes such betting fodder superfluousLeinster face an uphill taskBy Robert Armstrong in DublinTHE ALL BLACKS begin the Irish leg of their 13-match tour at Lansdowne Road today against Leinsterwho have never beaten a major touring sideLeinster have named a team that looks strong on paperincluding eight internationalsyet they recently lost to both Munster and Ulster in the Inter-Provincial ChampionshipSuch is the mood of pessimism here it is hard to find anyone who believes the All Blackshaving won their seven matches in Waleswill face any significant threat during the next fortnightUlsterthe provincial championsmay well fancy their chances on November 21but Leinster look certain to face an uphill struggle even though the tourists have rested 13 of the team that beat WalesLeinster will be hard pushed to keep the score within the respectable margins of defeat set by their predecessorsIn 1964 the All Blacks defeated Leinster 11-5they won 17-8 in 1972 and scraped home 8-3 in 1974Howeverduring the Eighties Irish provincial rugby has assumed a Third World status in relation to New Zealand'sLeinster have been undermined by their failure to secure prestige fixtures since the mid-SeventiesWhen New Zealand last toured Ireland in 1978 Leinster were ignoredThe same thing happened in 1984 when the province was denied a fixture against the WallabiesSuch neglect has done nothing for their confidenceEven sothe All Blackswho include seven capped playerswill give today's opponents due respectAs their coachAlex WyllieremarkedWhen we arrived in Wales we

competitiveSo often in conditions races we see just a handful of runners competing for good prizemoneya situation which has prompted a reduction in Pattern races from 139 to 101 in the 1990-91 seasonA new Jump Pattern has been worked out and some new races created specifically for horses whose optimum trip is two and a half milesa distance not previously catered for at championship level both over hurdles and fencesalthough there will still be nothing for novice chasers over that distance at the Cheltenham FestivalRacecourses have been advised by the Jockey Club to make their own security arrangements against the use of sonic binoculars of the type allegedly used to frighten Ile De Chypre at Royal Ascot last seasonCricketWise counsel needed in SA talks on tourBy John Perlman in JohannesburgWHEN 20 representatives of the South African Cricket Union and the National Sports Congress sit down together in a Johannesburg hotel tonight it is to be hoped that among them is someone with the wisdom of SolomonBoth parties are taking the talks seriously and a commitment to resolving their diametrically opposed views of next year's rebel cricket tour by an English team is evidentBut a gulf in perception will have to be bridgedleaps of faith made and a deal struckAnd to do that will require individuals with the ability to clarify the issues and an acute sense of when they might advance by retreating a littleThe eve-of-talks optimism of the Sacu presidentGeoff Daikinwas not even dented by the state-run televisionwhich quoted him as saying that Sacu would push for the tour at all costsThey didn't even speak to mehe saidDaikin said he had indications from people involved in making a better South Africathat if the tour were not to take place there are certain advantages that may flow from that decisiona highly attractive package for young South Africans of the future that involves more than cricketHe would not go into detail on what he called sensitive issues and sensitive talksbut saidI would be a fool to hinder this by insisting on a cricket tourHe may first have to overcome the scepticism of some members of his own groupDaikin believes that the two parties have an important starting pointWe are all working for the same goalhe saysBut it will be crucial for them to move on quickly to those considerable differences on politicsthe boycott and the role of sport in social change which have set them at odds and made tonight's meeting necessaryThey must take serious note of the political dynamics taking place in the countrysaid the NSC's Krish NaidooIt is an opportunity to spell out to them what these dynamics areNaidoo reiterated that the NSC was expecting Sacu to come to a decision and could not ease it for them by offering guarantees of future toursWe are asking them to become part of a process of changeAnd in being part of that process you have to show good faithThey must decide whether they want to be part of the decaying apartheid system or part of a new South AfricaIf Sacu is to choose the latter roadthe NSC may have to give them a clearer idea of what they will meet as they travel along itNewport look for coaches to turn a falling

remained unbeatenThere has been almost a hush about tonight's eventPenalosa did not arrive in Britain until the weekendapparently because of visa problemswhile McAuley is disgruntled because he wanted the fight to be in Belfastwhere it was originally arranged until he suffered an injuryPenalosa's lack of mobility is counter-balanced by his southpaw stance and hard punchHe may be surprised at

host broadcasting operation of televisionThe hope that the BBC or ITV would move into this job as they would for Commonwealth or Olympic Games was never realistic but it has taken Sheffield a long time to come to terms with the factNow they hope to contain the basic costs of providing coverage of most of the 10 sports to £1.4 millionThey will offer package programmes at minimal costin the hope
