Secretary of State Peter BrookeSpeaking at the Gallaher Business Challenge Awardshe said the change in tactics signalled a move away from concentrating purely on job promotionA competitive world market made it essential for businesses to be at least as competitive as their overseas rivalsA more competitive Northern Ireland economy will of course lead toin the long terman increased level of secure and worthwhile employmentsaid Mr BrookeThe Gallaher finalists fit this profile they have already marked themselves out as winnersThe criteria for the awards emphasised total quality management and innovationMr Brooke said Ledu would focus on the softwareside of business by raising awareness of the importance of quality and market researchand improving export performanceSoldier's bravery

MedalBlandBrooke angers unionistsUNIONIST MPs rounded on Ulster Secretary Peter Brooke yesterday after he turned down calls for selective internment in the wake of the IRA bomb outrage at Musgrave Park HospitalHe failed to announce any new security initiatives in his Commons statement on the atrocityin which two soldiers diedand his words were dismissed by Strangford MP John Taylor as bland generalitiesHe said Mr Brooke had nothing to offer the people of Northern Ireland and he told the HouseThere must be condemnation of those who fail to take on the IRA and the finger must be pointed at the Secretary of State and those behind himIt is this Government which introduced Dublin rule through the Anglo-Irish Agreement and gave encouragement to the terrorists and they're responding in kindThe Saturday afternoon bombing in which 11 people were injuredamong them a five-year-old girl and a baby of four months was condemned by Mr Brooke as an act of cynical depravityAnd he rejected the IRA's callous and cynicalclaims that the building was an operational military baseIt is purely and simply a hospitaldedicated to healing and the relief of sufferingMr Brooke saidThe nearest security force base is more than a quarter of a mile away and was manifestly not the target of the attackThe internment calls were spearheaded by Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis and DUP leader Ian PaisleyThe need for the introduction of internment is staring us in the faceMr Maginnis insistedMr Paisley spoke of the deep revulsionover the hospital bombing and said internment should be a weapon in the armoury of any civilised countryMr Brooke responded to a demand from Mr Paisley that he would not allow his hands to be tied by DublinHe saidI give the House a full assurance thatin the event of the introduction of executive detentionit would be carried out by Her Majesty's Government in line with legislation passed by this HouseHe said that bringing in internment would be a very serious stepthe consequences of which would be difficult to predictI would only consider using it in very particular circumstancesand for obvious reasonsI would not predict what those circumstances might beMr Brooke told MPs that the 20lb Semtex bomb was left part way along a service tunnel between two hospital buildingsOne contained orthopaedic and children's wardsand the second wards and other medical facilities administered by the RAMC for servicementheir families and some civiliansHe said thatin addition to the deaths and injuriesthe blast caused severe damage to both buildings amounting to at least £250,000In a newly refurbished children's ward in the Withers Blockdebris had fallen on a father who was nursing his baby daughterOther children in that ward were immobilised in tractionSo far97 operations due to have been performed early this week have been cancelled and 80 out of 200 NHS beds in the hospital have been rendered unusableI am sure the whole House will join me in utter condemnation of this appalling attackBut the cynical depravity of this outrage must surely mark one of the lowest points in the IRA's inglorious historyI reject all attempts to justify this attackLet there be no doubt it has shown the IRA in its true coloursIt was an attack on the whole community on sick children and their parentson old people whose much-needed operations will have to be delayedon the medical staff who devotedly care for themand on the security forces who will continue to defend the community and to bring terrorists to justiceMr Brooke said such attacks would not deflect the Government or the security forces from doing their duty in seeing off these evil men who want to destroy all that is best in our communityThe horrible nature of this attack only underlines that these are the sort of people whom all democrats opposeShadow Northern Ireland secretary Kevin McNamara backed Mr BrookesayingThe IRA are not soldiers but assassins carrying out a squalid murder campaignHe described the attack as a crime against humanityand urged Mr Brooke not to be hustledinto steps which could only aggravate the situationThe attack showed that security force members were at risk all the time and they could now best be repaid by finding a political solution to the Ulster conflictMr McNamara said the bombing was in complete disregard of the Geneva Conventionwhich demanded respect for the wounded and sickClearly the IRA has cruelly and inhumanely violated those principlesThe members of the IRA claim to be soldiers fighting a just warbut real soldiers are bound by the terms of the conventionThe Labour spokesman called for a quick decision on RUC requests for more manpower and Mr Brooke replied that he expected to make an announcement very soonMr Maginnisthe UUP's security spokesmanexpressed disappointment that there was still no indication that the means necessary to disrupt the command and control structure of the IRA were being implementedThe need to intern is staring us in the facehe saidFor people to suggest that to intern is to bring people on to the streets casts doubts on the integrity of the vast majority of people in Northern IrelandThe majority of the community from which I come would welcome internment at this timeMr PaisleyMP for North Antrimsaid internment should be used to take out of circulation those who were seeking to destroymurder and maimHe said there was a cry from all parts of the Province for security policies that would extirpate the IRASDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon said he thought he had seen it all but the hospital bombing had broken every precept of human compassion and moralityHe called on those involved in the political process to play their part by trying to end this terrible spiral of killing and despairThey all had a bounden responsibility to start negotiations to end the nightmareMr Brooke said the summer's inter-party discussions were not peace talks as suchbut they were one of the pressures that could be mounted on the terroristsHe backed a call by Tory MP Barry Porter for loyalist paramilitaries not to retaliateMr Porter had said if loyalists did so they would get no support from the House or the countryDUP Mid-Ulster MP William McCrea said Stormont minister Richard Needham called the Provos Fascist beastsYet the Government expected unionists to sit in the same council chamber with themPETER Brookerightkeeps internment option on icedespite pleas from unionist MPsincluding Ken MaginnisaboveBaker wins a thriller to stay in raceBOWLSJim Baker will meet Dessie Hill in the quarter final of the Co Antrim Indoor Bowls Club's Singles ChampionshipsThe former World No 1 who astonishingly announced his retirement from the game during last season's home international series in Scotlandbut has since reversed that decision is now bang on course to retain his singles titleCertainlyBaker showed no ill-effects from his short lay-off when he beat fellow international Sammy Allen to book his place in the last eightHoweverBaker had to call on his years of experience to shake off the gritty Ballymena manwho made all the runningbut faltered over the final endsAllen held a 5–4 advantage at the 5th end and over the next four raced into a commanding 13–6 leadAllen was still in control at the 15thleading 16–12but then Baker began his revivalThe reigning champion pulled the scores back to 17–17 at the 20th before Allen nosed in front 18–17Howeverthat was Sammy's final contribution to a thrilling game because Baker picked up four shots over the next two ends to clinch victoryIf Baker found it tighthis quarter final opponent couldn't have had it much easierbecause Hill booked his place courtesy of a remarkable 21–0 victory over Tommy EvansThe remaining quarter final line-up is Mark Trew v Stephen Moran in Section ADavid Carson will oppose George Hamilton in Section Cwhile Sammy Hall plays international team mate Davy Johnston in Section D. The Baker-Hill game makes up Section B.Hall was in tremendous form in his last outing when defeating Michael Nutt 21–7The Ormeau playerwho made his Irish debut last seasonwas never in trouble against

favourite by Corals and Ladbrokesbut Brooks warnedHe's far from a definite runnerI'm not all that keen on the race because he prefers a flatter trackI want to wait until I know more about the likely oppositionI wouldn't advise anybody to back him until the day of the raceTwenty-one of the 51 entries stood their ground at yesterday's five-day stageJOB FOR MILLARLiam Brady yesterday pinned his faith in winger Joe Miller to help extricate Celtic from the hole they dug for themselves in Switzerland two weeks agoThe Glasgow side must beat Neuchatel Xamax 4–0 at Parkhead tomorrow night to qualify for the third round of the UEFA Cupbut Brady believes his side can accomplish that awesome taskBrady aims to field the same 11 players who began Saturday's Old Firm clash with Rangers at Ibrox and admittedI'm depending a lot on Joe Miller and I've told him soThe 23 year old is one of the few old-fashioned wingers left in the Scottish game and Brady addedI think Joe could be a key player for usIf he's on song he can unlock what is bound to be a very defensive set-up by NeuchatelI need Joe to get to the by-line and supply the ammunition for our strikers and he knows thatWe are counting on a very big performance from himTony Cascarinowho scored the equaliser in the 1–1 draw with Rangerswill be on the bench againwhile Gary Gillespie has been ruled out of the returnCeltic's 5–1 defeat in Switzerland still irritates Bradywho admits that not even in his playing days did he take part in a recovery of these proportionsIt never happened to mebut it has happened beforesaid the Celtic bossI still have a nagging disappointment and frustration from that first leg but I still believe we have a big chanceI am not just saying that for effectI genuinely believe it and so do the playersNeuchatelwho arrive in Glasgow this afternoonhave a slight doubt over striker Hossam Hossan who grabbed four of the five goals in the first legbut missed his team's weekend fixture with a foot

extravaganzaat Maysfield Leisure CentreMusgrave horrorHospital counts the cost of terrorTHE IRA bomb which killed two soldiers at Belfast's Musgrave Park Hospital put almost 50 per cent of the hospital's civilian beds out of commission and halted orthopaedic surgeryit was revealed yesterdayA spokesman for the Eastern Health Board said the attack affected more than 80 of the hospital's 200 bedsincluding a new children's ward which opened on FridayHealth board engineers have been working around the clock since Saturday's attack to get operating theatres cleaned and sterilisedBut already operations on 35 patients due for orthopaedic surgery over the next two days have been cancelledand more may followThe situation will be reviewed this morning by a medical-nursing and management team but according to an insiderthe five operating theatres knocked out of action by the bomb may not be deemed re-sterilised before FridayBy then 100 operations would have been cancelledSome of the patients waiting for surgery are young children born with congenital problemsMusgrave Park is the regional centre for orthopaedic surgery and has a reputation second to none for its geriatric workA new geriatric centre is due to open later this monthThe bomb blast fractured the ventilating system and spewed dust particles along the system throughout the hospitalPiping carrying phone cables were also been fractured and the steel gland which carries the steam for sterilising equipment in the theatres had to be closed downThe maintenance staff has been working 18-hour shifts to bring the hospital into full operationDetails of the damage to the hospital were released after the IRA issued a second statement trying to justify the bombing its first attack on a hospital site in Northern IrelandAs well as killing the two soldiersthe blast also injured several peopleincluding a five-year-old girlThe IRA state categorically that this was not an attack on a hospitalthe IRA statement claimedThe target was an operational British Army base which is situated adjacent to the hospitalThe 20lb Semtex device was planted beneath an operating theatre in a duct between civilian and military

technologyONE of the most fashionable computer applications at the moment is Desk Top PublishingUnfortunatelythe level of interest is not backed up by the right level of knowledge either from prospective users or from many of the suppliersIndeedthere is no agreed definition of what constitutes desk top publishingThe narrowest definition would be the use of page layout software on a PC and using a laser printerHoweverothers may have a broader view eg. the use of appropriate software on PCs to create formatted printed material for widespread distributionEven using the narrow definition it is clear that desk top publishing is a complex and technical areaIt is highly technical not just in the sense that it involves computer technology but also because it is totally based in the area of printingThe latter abounds with its own specialists eg. designerseditorspasteup artiststypographers and all using their own jargonTo gain the most benefit from installing a desk top publishing system you must be prepared to learn something about the general area of printingYou must also have a clear idea of why you want such a systemIt is not enough to have a wish to improve the quality of your reportsprice lists etcYou need to define the sort of layout you require eg columnardifferent type stylesphotographs or diagramsIf you define your requirements in enough detail you could find that a good word processing package used with a laser printer could satisfy your needsEven if you do require a full desk top publishing system these can range quality in price depending on exactly what you requireGenerally speakinga full desk top publishing system requires at least the followingappropriate software the desk top publishingpackagea PC with enough memoryprocessing power and disk spacea high quality monitor to display the documents prior to printinga suitable laser printerMost people would also consider a scanner so that they can capture images and documentsDesk Top Publishing can bring benefits to an organisation but only if the requirements are properly defined and there is an appreciation of what such systems can do and the learning curve involvedHoweverall too often such systems end up as glorified word processors just producing documents with different sizes of print and maybe a few boxesSEND IN SAS CALLUNIONISTS in Belfast have called for the SAS to take out known republican terroristsLast night's meeting of Belfast City Council was adjourned in honour of the dead and injured from Saturday's IRA bomb attack at Musgrave Park HospitalA minute's silence was observedduring which two members of Sinn Fein left the chamberAt an impromptu Press conferenceunionist councillors accused Secretary of State Peter Brooke of not having the guts to take on the IRAAlderman Jim Kirkpatrickleader of the Ulster Unionist grouping in the chambersaid the Government was abandoning its duty of protecting citizensHe said it was time crack SAS troops were deployed to take out leading members of the IRAThe policies adopted by every Government since 1972 have failed all we hear in response is the gospel of hopelessnesshe saidWe believe the Government has two optionsOne is to introduce selective internment and the other is to deploy the SAS effectivelyHoweverI don't believe this Government or Peter Brooke has the belly to deploy the SAS effectively so the only alternative is selective internmentDelay costs livesIf the bombing of a hospital cannot shake the Government out of its complacencywhat willSelective internmenthe saidwould free the Roman Catholic people of the Falls from the stranglehold of terrorismOrdinary Catholics on the Falls Road cannot stand up to the IRAIt is too much to askMr Kirkpatrick said terrorists should be targetedFormer Lord Mayor Tommy Patton slammed Sinn Fein councillors for having the audacityto turn up for last night's council meeting two days after the atrocityHe said the Government had failed to understand the depth of feeling amongst unionistsespecially as they had to share the council chamber with Sinn FeinFellow councillor Margaret Crooks said it was clear the bombing had been an inside joband she called for those who helped the bombers to be ostracisedShe said there could be no complaints if they were hangedSammy Wilson of the DUP said it was a scandal the political henchmenof those who carried out the bombing were allowed into the City HallRichard Needham claims that they belong in helland in that he is correcthe saidThe realityhoweveris that his Government has given the bombers' political wing the right to be in the council chamberHoweverSinn Fein councillor Alex Maskey defended the Musgrave Park bombingHe said the IRA had bombed a military targetThe fact is troops are not welcome hereThe British Army knows when they send troops here they are going to be targetsThat is a fact of lifeI think it is tragic that anybody has to die in this conflict but the Peter Brookes and Richard Needhams of this world have the solution in their handsThey can begin the process which will lead to a withdrawal from Northern IrelandWhile the British are herethe IRA will continue to attack themHe said he was not aware that it was IRA policy to bomb operating theatresMr Maskey added that internment in any form would not bring an end to the republican campaignEarlierleading Sinn Fein member Martin McGuinness said Britain was to blame for Saturday's bombingIn siting its military basesit has consistently sought to use the civilian population as human

people is rising and Britons must radically change their diet if they are to meet Government health standards by the end of the centurya nutritionist said yesterdayAlthough people cut down fats and sugar in the 1980s following official advicethere were more fat and very fat people in 1987 than in 1980Dr David Buss told nutritionists and doctors at a Royal College of Physicians conference in LondonThere were also more fat women than fat menThe proportion of very fat women had risen from 8 per cent to 12 per centwhile the proportion of obese men had risen from 6 per cent to 8 per cent said Dr Busshead of nutrition at the Ministry of Agriculture Food and FisheriesWomen did not eat as many sausagespiesor fish and chips than menyet did have more fruit and recommended reduced fat milkConsumption of butter today was only half what it was in 1980 and a quarter of the 1970s figuresDr Buss saidThe increase in numbers of fat and very fat people in the 1980s showed diet was not the only factorLack of exercise and the motor car probably play a partDr Buss saidPeople needed to return to something nearer the wartime diet with the fruit it lacked to meet health targetsthough howI do not knowYou cannot drag people screaming to oneCheck the spare tyreMIDDLE-AGED women are growing fatter as the century wears on despite the wealth of slimmers' dietsa leading nutritionist has claimedDr Margaret Ashwell told the conference that the worst form of middle-age spread was around the middle as the traditional beer-belly shape meant more fat was concentrated where it does most

ever been such a sickening and depressing sight as Secretary of State Peter Brooke's performance at Westminster yesterdayEven by House of Commons standards his words of condemnation and pledges on security rang like an empty barrel in the ears of those who have suffered at the hands of the terrorists for more than 20 yearsCynical depravity. ||callous claims||the Government will not be deflected from its duty||the meaningless phrases were all theretrotted out yet again to disguise the lack of real commitment to grab terrorism by the scruff of the neckYesterday they were spewed out in the aftermath of the Musgrave Park Hospital outrage but they were the same words which Mr Brooke and his predecessors have used time and time again after other bloody acts of terrorismOf course Mr Brooke and the others at the Northern Ireland Office won't give in to terrorismThey don't have toNeither do they have to face up to itThey live in a political cowards' Disney world where Tom is always chasing Gerry in an ever-decreasing circle of options whileoutside in the real worldBugs Bunny is having his tail shot off as he chokes on the latest political carrotWorse stillthe rabbit has no real hope of reaching the safety of Mr Brooke's warrenIn the real world political initiatives come a poor second to security considerationsIf only Mr Brooke were to stick his head above the parapet he would soon realise that factWhile he persists in looking for the golden egg before the chicken is even hatched the terrorists will continue to exact a mounting price in blood for his dithering

Feinits presidentGerry Adamsrefused to condemn the IRA outrage at Musgrave Park HospitalAnd he later said he was concerned about patient care in the Royal Victoria HospitalMr Adams made his offer to meet the four church leaders in a letter last Augustbut in their reply the churchmen said they would not talk until Sinn Fein publicly called for an end to violenceThe message was delivered to Mr Adams on Sundayyet only a few hours later he refused to join with the leaders of constitutional parties in condemning the bomb outrageHe saidThe politics of selective condemnation will mean little to the victims or the families of the victims of the IRA operationMany people will note that British ministers and other politicians are not as outspoken about other deaths arising out of this conflictUnlike themSinn Fein regrets all deaths and injuriesThe politics of condemnation are no substitute for a real process towards peaceMr Adam's offer to meet with church leaders was discussed by Cardinal Cahal DalyArchbishop Robin EamesPresbyterian Moderator the Very Rev Rodney Sterritt and Methodist President the Rev Winston GoodThey told Mr Adams they welcomed the statement that Sinn Fein was committed to work towards bringing the conflict to an endand that he was prepared to take political riskThe church leaders saidIn our opinion these are merely words fine words certainly and welcome but nevertheless only wordsUntil Sinn Fein gives publictangible and credible proof that it is actually taking the only political riskwhich is meaningful in our situationnamely calling for the cessation of violencethen your words will lack credibilityThe church leaders said that no party which supports violence can seriously claim to be discharging its responsibilities in a positive and honourable wayin so far as the establishment of peace is concernedAnd Cardinal Daly askedHow can they relate what happened on Saturday to the fine words they wrote in AugustMr Good said the four leaders came to the conclusion that they would not be preparedunder any circumstancesto talk with men and women who use violence and kill and destroyI haven't heard anything to suggest that Sinn Fein are condemning the bombing at Musgrave Park Hospitalhe saidI can't envisage any circumstances in which we as church leaders would talkSinn Fein spokesman Martin McGuinness said the party would discuss the letter from the church leaders and give them a considered response in the near futureMr McGuinness saidIn view of the ongoing conflictwith people being killed by British state forcesthe IRA and loyalist death squadsthere is a heavy responsibility on those in our society who have influence to sit down and discuss how this conflict can be brought to an endSDLP councillor Dr Joe Hendron condemned the hypocrisy of Sinn Fein and what he called the depraved bombing of a hospitalattacking the most vulnerableHe found it incredible that Mr Adams should issue a statement within hours of the hospital bombing expressing his concern for patients in the granting of trust status to the Royal Victoria HospitalGERRY ADAMS attackedWINSTON GOOD talks rejectedChallenge on CastlereaghI watched with interest the UTV Counterpoint programme31 October 1991featuring Denis Faul and Mr David Trimble MPregarding allegations of mistreatment at Castlereagh RUC centreAs a result of this programme I wish to ask two questions1Is Denis Faul under the impression that all those interviewed at Castlereagh are of the Roman faithI would advise anyone taken to Castlereagh to sit on the floor and say the Rosary for seven days2Would Denis Faul deny thatin the events leading up to the conviction of the so-called UDR 4he passed information to the RUCconditional upon the following points1that the entire UDR patrol operating in the north of the city should be arrested by police officers from another locality2that the UDR soldiers be taken to a holding centre other than Gough Barracksnamely Castlereagh3that the interviewing officer should be of senior rank and again the majority of these officers preferably completely unknown to any of the soldiers see the case for a re-trial of the UDR

LondonICL's Gary Burnett answers questionsI've heard that by next year 60 per cent of all PCs will be connected to local area networksWhat are the major networks that are being usedTHe local area network business is growing much more quickly than the PC industry as a wholeBy 1994it is likely that there will be more business PCs attached to LANs than there were total business PCs two years agoThe fuel for this growth has been the demand by users to share applications and dataand to connect disparate information systems and environmentsrather than computing in isolationWorkgroup computingis the new industry buzz word that describes this trend amongst business PC usersIn additionthe proliferation of networks has been assisted by the arrival of effective PC networking standards a couple of years agoNow more than 60 per cent of the networked market has standardized on Novell Netwareto the point where the choice of a PC network is termed a no-brainerdecision by US analystsThe Novell system is supported by virtually all the leading PC software products that run on networksThe most advanced version of NetwareNetware 3.11is a sophisticated network management systemwith support for up to 250 usersfault-tolerantcomputing features and facilities to link into minicomputersmainframe systems and Wide-Area NetworksIn additionit has the ability to link a huge variety of hardware and operating systems platforms these includeas well as DOSOS/2 and WindowsApple MacsSun Systems and a number of UNIX workstationsNovell's network products are mostly for PCsbut the next few years will see them move into the traditional minicomputer market with support for a number of minicomputer systemsthus re-enforcing their dominanceDominant Novell may bebut there are alternativesMicrosoft is fighting hard to compete in the PC network market with their Lan ManagerThe current version of the product is designed to fit in with Microsoft's Windows NT New Technologystrategy and allows Microsoft to offer an environment that runs on anything from laptops to 80486 servers and engineering workstationsIt remains to be seen who will end up being the dominant supplierbut it would seem that the sheer volume of Novell and DOS/Windows users will dictate that future PC Lan systems will have to be compatible with themChildren check out book weekMICHAEL

it was danced in Paris in 1913Everybody keeps their clothes on and in any case the French were not thenor nowa people to blanche at mere nudityWhat they witnessedand what was recreated for us by the Ulster Youth Dance Company in Stranmillis College Theatre at the weekend was a spectacle far more disturbing and revolutionaryFor The Rite Of Spring celebrates the mythical and timeless regeneration of both the natural and the human world in a spirit far removed from the tranquil and ordinary daffodils immortalised by WordsworthThe dance responds to another rhythm the violent modern dissonances of Stravinsky's famous musical score and spring releases itself with a boundlessdangerous energy in movements tensemuscular and frankly sensualIf you were expecting the graceful and chaste fluidity of Swan Lakeyou would surely have got the right gunkThe stage at Stranmillis is too small for the 90-odd cast and a couple of fainting youngsters had to receive kindly ministrations from an American nurseTip for reviewersBring a medicNonethelessthe great pulsating wheelsthe furious criss-cross rushes over the floorthe rapid shift from gentleundulating movement to angular violence and the sheer weight of numbers on stage gave to the performance an undeniable exhilarationBut more than thatit gave a sense of tensionamounting at times to menace which wasperhapswhat shocked those urbane ParisiansHere is Earthclad in what looks disconcertingly like a badly crocheted red dresshere is a stage where an eerie pale yellow orange light plays over small details of figuresand here is a child carried off on a pole one in a series of victims in the sacrificial Rite Of SpringUnder the rational conventions of the cycle of the seasons there is revealed a subversive world where the sensual and violent creation of new life is enactedThe lid is liftedthe subconscious reveals itselfGod-like and demonicboth challenging to light assumptionsAn established order of seeingof understandingof rulingis simply exploded the Modernist spirit asserts itselfEspecially spectacular was the veil scene where three spectral figures hang suspended above a billowing orange red clothheld like a tent over the dancersAnd memorable too was the dance of the Earth in her bloody red dress rapacious andequallyhuntedFrom a purely technical point of viewthis may not have been the standard performancebut in a place almost completely lacking in a tradition of classical danceit is a delight to watch native talent channelled so joyously and with such a spirit of challenge to the myth that we exist only

may view its action as of little consequence a perverted act of war in a vicious campaign but they would be wrong forby this act on top of so many othersthey have turned the Ireland of hope and dreams into a nightmare of guiltshameresentmentremorseanger and griefThe crucifix which used to adorn the portrait of the Protestant patriot Robert Emmet in so many of the simple homes of Ireland symbolised

surely be calling to you to ponder on what you have doneFinian physician to the heroic King of UlsterConnor MacNessa of Emhain Machamay well be calling too in grief as the chivalrous upholder of the ancient Gaelic comraind legis or impartial treatment of the woundedIn those days the warriors fought by day in the open and at night they dressed one another 's woundsThe PIRA choose instead to ignore the plight of the wounded in their sanctuary and to plan instead to destroy itkilling in the processThe Brehon Laws representing the most ancient code in Europe and existing centuries before the birth of Christlonglong before any conquest or plantation in Irelandmade special provision for the sick both for their accommodation and for their protectionIn Medieval times the Benedictine monasteries had a rule which called for the care of the sick to be placed above and before every other thingas if indeed Christ were being directly served in waiting upon themThe wartime bombers didn't seem to care what went upby contrast the PIRA did and cared so deliberately as to set out selectively to destroy what is now an illusion the sanctity of hospital in whichregardless of loyalty or backgroundso many thousands of victims of our vicious little civil war have received care since those nights in August 1969With the vision of Robert Emmet and the crucifix in mindcould the PIRA not stop to ask how they or any of the rest of us for that matter may redeem the bitter legacy of centuries by adding to itHORRORthe scene at Musgrave Park Hospital in Belfast after the IRA bomb blast at the weekendIt's end of the road for Captain MarvelRobson hangs up England shirt after 90 gamesSOCCERCaptain MarvelBryan Robson yesterday gave up the fight to keep his 34 year old legs pounding towards a century of caps and announced his England retirementThe Manchester United captainthe rock on which both Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson built their hopesdecided to quit the international scene after last month's depressing win over TurkeyOld Trafford boss Alex Ferguson talked him out of an immediate announcementbut Graham Taylor's decision not to retain Robson for next week's decisive game in Poland made any further delay pointlessThe England manager accepts his decision as realistic andeven though Robson was never central to his establishment of a new generationhe summed up everyone's sadness at the old warhorse's parting10 short of the magic 100 capsWe are talking about a man who played 90 times for England and if he hadn't been injured would certainly have played over 100He's played for a decade for his countryhe's been an inspirational playerHe's been to three World Cups and one European Championship that record is there for everyone to seeIt falls to meas it did first with Peter Shilton and then with Terry Butcherto place on record on behalf of the Football Association what he has done for his countryIt's an international career coming to a close and one that people have been full of admiration for for over a decadeTaylor was at pains to stress that Robson's decision to retire had nothing to do with piqueAlex felt that if I selected him for the Poland gamehe should play and try to help us get the result before announcing his retirementand that was Bryan's intentionTaylor was surprised that Robson forced his way back into the side this seasonafter having only a disappointing performance against the Irish when he made his previous comeback in MarchBryan had an exceptional start to the season and that certainly was my reasoning behind bringing him back into the Turkey gamesaid TaylorBut even now he's having to pick his gameswith one every three days or soand he is 34 years of age and we can't alter thatBryan did no better or no worse than anyone else in the Turkey gamebut that's not the standard by which he judges himselfHe judges himself by being betterHe said to me that he felt that in the last couple of internationals he hadn't done himself justiceI wouldn't want that to be seen against the other 88The England squad for the European championship qualifier in Poland on November 13GOODBYE England captain Bryan Robson calls a halt to his international careerRoxburgh calls up his hit squadScotland manager Andy Roxburgh yesterday named the most attack-minded squad of his career in an effort to combat San Marino at Hampden Park next WednesdayRoxburgh believes that the minnows of Group Two in the European Championship will employ every negative tactic available to themso the Scots boss has included only five out-and-out defenders in an attack-minded squad of 21 for a game in which every goal will be preciousDepending on the outcome of the other matches involving SwitzerlandRomania and BulgariaScotland may need an 11-goal victory to qualify for the finalsWe have to adopt a really attacking policy and give it our best shotdeclared Roxburghwho has recalled creative players in Celtic's Paul McStay and John Collins along with Rangers skipper Richard GoughThe way San Marino play tends to keep scores to a minimumThey are really frustrating to play against and we badly need a good startThe actual playing time is the big problemA game lasts 90 minutesbut you're lucky if it's 50 minutes actual playing time and that is not too much time to run up a scoreRoxburgh will travel to Switzerland on Thursday in an effort to overturn the UEFA decision to make Scotland kick-off at 2.30pmA three-man delegation is heading for Geneva to deliver the Scottish FA's appeal and Roxburgh saidIt is really important to have vocal backing at Hampdennot only to stir up our guys but to put San Marino under pressureSwitzerland had four home matches with full houses at normal kick-off times so why should we be denied that basic rightDuffy throughbut sad Sharpe outSNOOKERMichael Duffy yesterday clinched a place in the last 16 of the World Amateur Championships in Bangkokbut there was great disappointment for Ulster number one Andy Sharpe who failed to

SunTHE final episode of the Coronation Street libel drama was a cliff-hanger to the very end even after a London High Court jury had awarded actor Bill Roache £50,000 damagesMr Roache known to millions as Ken Barlow had convinced the jurors that he was not smugself-satisfied and boring and that he had been defamed by an article in The Sun which suggested just thatAfter two and a half hours of deliberationthey awarded damages against The Suneditor Kelvin MacKenzie and freelance journalist Ken IrwinBut the 59-year-old actor had to endure another 15 minutes of crucial legal argument to discover if his gamble in refusing The Sun's pre-trial settlement offer of £50,000 made on October 7 had backfired and meant he would have to pay the bulk of the estimated £200,000 costs of the caseThere were sighs of relief on Mr Roache's side as Mr Justice Waterhouse ruled that he was entitled to his costsThe Sun was granted leave to appeal against his orderIt argued thatfollowing normal legal procedureMr Roache should have to pay the costs incurred from the date of the settlement offer because the jury's award failed to top itThe judge also granted an injunction preventing The Sun from repeating any of the libelsAs the forewoman of the six-mansix woman jury announced the verdictMr Roacheswallowed hard and gripped the bench in front of himHis wife Sara42covered her eyes with her
