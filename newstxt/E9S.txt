AIDS expert warns against complacencyProfessor claims number of people with disease is on the increaseGOVERNMENT spending cuts in the fight against AIDS and complacency over the risk to the general public could make an epidemic among heterosexuals more likelya leading expert warned yesterdayProfessor Nicholas Day is the author of an unpublished Public Health Laboratory Service report on the spread of AIDS which has been expected to revise official predictions of heterosexual victims downwardsBut he gave a rare interview yesterdaystressing his belief that his report had been grossly misrepresented and that numbers infected heterosexually were substantialand growingHe spoke on a radio programme on which Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley defended AIDS spending cutssaying the campaign should now be aimed at groups most at riskrather than at the wider populationProfessor Dayhead of the Institute of Public Health at Cambridge UniversitysaidI think it would be a disaster if the Government decided that a heterosexual epidemic was not a realistic prospect for the futureIf they acted accordingly it would increase the risk that just such an epidemic would occurhe warnedProf Day questioned the hidden agendaof newspapers which suggested his report indicated the AIDS threat to heterosexuals was overThe message they have been giving is totally irresponsiblehe saidSome had called for public acceptance that homosexuals and drug users were the only people facing a real risk of getting AIDSIt just isn't true that the number of people infected heterosexually in this country is minimalhe saidMrs Bottomley said Prof Day was quite rightthat AIDS remained a very serious threat but added that new statistics made it possible to frame future policy according to factsnot fantasyThe campaign aimed at the general population had been right at a time when there was ignorance about AIDSshe saidIt had helped Britain to keep AIDS levels at a sixth of those in France and a third of Italy'sBut I think it is time to move on to target the groups most at riskshe saidCounty seeking entrants for environment schemeESSEX County Council is looking for entrants for its 1993

aliveESSEX villagers rediscovered the outer limits of their parishes yesterday as they re-enacted the centuries-old custom of Beating the BoundsThe ceremony is a tradition associated with Rogation Sunday the fifth Sunday after Easter when some churches also hold open-air services and bless newly sown cropsHoweverthe origins of the practice are thought to pre-date Christianity in Britainwith earlier pagan fertility rites having been adapted by the Church in the fifth centuryWillow branchesThis explains the traditional use of branches from the willow tree noted for its vigorous growth to beat the line of the boundaryBeating the Bounds also served a practical purpose in the days before mapsreminding villagers where the boundaries of their parish and the areas of common land within actually layTodayparticipation in the event is encouraged by the Open Spaces Societywhich was formed in 1865 to fight for the preservation of Hampstead Heath and which now campaigns nationally for the protection of commonsvillage greens and footpathsAmong the groups in Essex who carried on the tradition yesterday were members of the Great Tey Footpath Preservation Society and villagers from neighbouring Chappelwho teamed up for a 14-mile walk around the boundaries of the two parishesTheir route also included the boundary of Chappel village greenwhere children in the party were given the bumps another echo of the ceremony's original purposeThe idea was to pass on the information from generation to generationso children traditionally played a very important partsaid a spokeswoman for the Open Spaces SocietyThey would beat the boundary stones or other landmarks with willow wands and sometimes the adults would bump the children's heads gently on the ground to imprint the knowledge in their memoriesThere are 8,675 commons and 3,865 village greens in England and Walesmainly remnants of the medieval manorial system of land divisionThe openness of commons and greens is an important feature in the landscapesaid the society spokeswomanTheir historyarchaeologywildlife and value for informal recreation are very highAncient land/But all too often the margins of our commons and greens are subject to encroachmentIf no action is takenit frequently results in the loss of common landBeating the bounds will remind local people just where their commons and greens are and discourage encroachments and other unlawful worksthus contributing to the safeguarding of these ancient pieces of landBeating the Boundsvillagers getting to know ChappelTories confident policies will

slightest doubt that is what is going to happenHome Secretary Kenneth Clarke said of Mr MajorI am sure he will retain the leadership for many years to come and he is in the process of emerging from the Government's present difficultiesAs they launched a follow-up operation to Mr Major's fight-back speech to Scottish Tories at Edinburgh on FridayHealth Secretary Virginia Bottomley warned that the Government must take seriously claims it is out of touch with what ordinary peopleare thinkingWe have heard a lot of that in the last ten daysshe told a meeting at St John's CollegeCambridgeyesterdayBut we should take it seriouslynonethelessThose in authority need to share the problems of those by whose grace that authority is exercisedWe need to put ourselves in the other person's shoesMrs Bottomley said that in her South-West Surrey constituency she had heard at first hand many stories of personal anguishcrisis and despair in the last hard yearThe misery of unemployment or of repossession is all the more stark for seeing it written in a face rather than on a pageIt should not surprise us that misery turns to protest when the temptation of the ballot box invitesThe plan was for a show of swift action by a listening Governmentto counter the demoralising effects of the Newbury and county council election disasters on May 6Today the Prime Minister will

action over the new council taxTreasurer Bernie Gaught is telling councillors that it is inevitablethat some people will be taken to courtThe council has however already collected £353,000 in cash plus another £856,000 by direct debitMr Gaught said that valuations of houses in the various bandings were a main area of discontentbecause the scope of value was possibly too narrow at either end of the spectrumMr Gaught also foresees problems where there is joint liability and liability for second homesand houses with multiple occupationApart from the appeals procedures on valuationssaid Mr Gaughtthe other main area of contention will certainly be the discounts to be appliedStudents and carers are likely to be among those who will be affected by thisAnother problem is trying to ensure that as many disabled people as possible claim their rightful reductionsMr Gaught tells of problems with the transitional reduction schemedesigned to help those faced with bills much higher than the previous community chargeHe saidThis appears at first glance to be quite a simple schemeuntil we come to actually explaining it to the customerWe have encountered a number of difficulties where the calculation of the scheme charge is certainly not what the customer expects to see on his billServices for mentally-ill at centre of plan to unite with trustHealth chiefs go to public on merger

branches of the NHS in the county still answerable directly to its local health authority rather than having trust statusManagers of the servicesupported by watchdog body the Mid Essex Community Health Councilhave always been keen any merger should involve another locally-based trustsHoweverthere has been some pressure at health authority level for the mental health service in mid Essex to merge instead with its counterpart in north-east Essexwhich is already a trustMergers of health authority-run services with trusts have been criticised by some opponents of the Government's NHS reforms as obtaining trust status by the back doorThe Department of Health told health authorities last autumn such mergers would only be allowed in exceptional circumstancesIt later issued new guidelines on the procedureUnder the new proposal for mental health services in mid Essexthere will be a three-month period of public consultationrunning until August 17If the merger is then approved by Health Secretary Virginia Bottomleythe Mid Essex Community Health Trust will be dissolved on March 31 next year and replaced the following day by a new trust also embracing the mental health servicesInstead of being run directly by a health authorityNHS trusts obtain their funding from contracts placed by health authorities and GPsAlthough technically still responsible to the North Essex health authorityMid Essex Mental Health Services is already managed on a contract basis by the community health trust with which it is planned to mergeCopies of the merger document are being sent to

materialsGovernment set for week of setbacksFigures to show recovery is slowing downGOVERNMENT euphoria surrounding the performance of the economy in recent weeks may burst this week after new statistics which are forecast to show Britain's climb out of recession is slowingFactory productionhigh street sales and unemployment figures are all expected to reveal a more sober picture after recent buoyant indicatorseconomists believeFigures over the past two months have been suspiciously strongunbelievably strongIt is very unlikely they can be sustainedsaid John Shepperdeconomist with merchant bank SG WarburgThere is no doubt of a recoverybut we are more likely to see a gentle climb rather than any sort of a boomhe saidPundits are unanimous that recovery has arrivedbut the string of statistics which have pointed to a vigorous upturn in the early part of the year have been greeted with cautionCity consensus is that economic realities will reassert themselves this week in the form of rising unemployment and weaker retail sales growth and industrial productionThe number of jobless is forecast to have risen about 15,000 in April after two unexpected months of declineRetail sales volumes are also expected to have come off the boil last month after rising strongly over the past quarterIndustrial productionwhich measures manufacturing output and energy productionis tipped to have fallen back sharply in March the latest figure available after a sharp drop in oil and gas productionSG Warburgs expect manufacturing output to have fallen about 0.5 per cent on the monthThe weaker figures will renew pressure on Chancellor Norman Lamont to consider another interest rate cut to ensure the upturn is not derailedBut the statistics would have to be extremely bad before Mr Lamont seriously considers such a moveHalf-century show is young farmers' bestTHE 50th anniversary show organised by Essex Young Farmers and held at the Great Leighs Showground yesterdaydisplayed

devalued in mid 1991 as he should have donethe recession would have been over much soonerThe prolonged recession wrecked Government financesas income from taxation fell and spending on social security roseMr Lamont made matters worse in his autumn statement of 1991 and his spring Budget of 1992 when he increased spending and cut taxationIf these measures had been designed to encourage investmentor to create jobsthey would at least have restored economic growthAs it wasthey merely added to Government borrowing while allowing the recession to continue as beforeNeeding to borrow £50,000 million this yearMr Lamont had to promise his creditors that he would put his accounts in order as soon as possibleTo that endhe announced in March that he would be raising taxation next yearand again the year after thatProposals for higher taxes on incomes have been grudgingly acceptedbut the introduction of VAT on domestic fuel has notPeople always protest against new forms of taxationand in this case they will protest now when it is threatenedand again next year when half is imposed and half is threatenedand again in 1995 when the full effect is felt on fuel billsThese protests will be all the strongerbecause the Cabinet has already changed its mind on a number of issuesIn Margaret Thatcher's daymost people thought that complaining was a waste of timebut a listeningGovernment must expect to be shouted atloud and longWhile Ministers might like to please the voters by abandoning VAT on fuelthey know that this would be disastrous abroadIf foreign bankers thought that the UK was not serious about balancing its books at some future timethey would be reluctant to lend their money at low interestIndeedit is likely that the Chancellorwhoever he may bewill have to consider even higher taxation in the next year or twothan has already been announcedIf that Chancellor is not to be Mr Lamonthe could quickly become as unpopular as Mr LamontMr Lamont hasby his mismanagement of the economyensured that none of his colleagues will be canvassing hard for his jobYet in the national interest as well as for the electoral advantage of his own partythe Prime Minister cannot let matters drift any furtherLast weekhe promised that there would be no more boom and bustThe last Prime Minister to give an undertaking of that kind was Harold Wilson in the 1960s and he went on to deliver bust without boomIt is not a happy precedent and if Mr Major is to avoid ithe needs somebody at the Treasury who commands confidenceand who deserves itThat somebody is not Mr LamontIRELAND'S historic

are always cheepingYESTERDAY was Rogation Sundaythe rituals of which are very old and its roots go far back into pre-Christian timesThey first appear in the fifth Century AD as part of the Christian sceneIt is a quaint custom in which our villagers beat the boundsride around on trailers pulled by tractors and sit on bales of strawUsually God's blessing on the fruit of the land is soughtwith a reading and prayers said in some field or farmyardThursday is Ascension Day when the church observes the bodily ascension of Christ into heavenAt this time the old custom of well-dressing takes placewhen wells are adorned with flowersThe ancient superstition is that the water gods required a sacrifice to keep them contentand the church later named wells after saints and called them holy wellsMany still believe that water from a well is pure and health-givingWith so many changes in the countryside I think it is nice to keep the old traditions asonce they are droppedit will be a job to get them going againA lot has been said in the Press and on television about the noises and smells of the countrysidePerhaps I will be thought outspokenbut so often it is those people who have moved into the country that complainI could hardly believe reading in one of the London papersthat cows are under threat and are being monitored for their noise levelThis really takes the biscuitWith all the trouble in the worldthe atrocious killing and starving peopleit annoys me that there are some people kicking up a fuss about the noise and smells from the farmsThere was one case where cockerels crowing in the night upset the neighboursI can't help agreeing with my brother that if some of the townspeople did a good day's hard workthey would be too tired to lie and listen to see if a cock was crowing in the night or the early dawnFor God's sakethis had been going on for yearswith animals making a noise surely this is what country life is all about and it would be a sad day if there were no noises from the farms or from the back gardens of our cottagesI feel sorry for the farmers with so many rules and changes from the Common Market lawsI am sure they don't know whether they are coming or goingwith all the form-fillingFor themit must be almost a relief to walk around listening to the cocks crowing or the cows mooing it must help to keep them saneWhen going into a supermarket to buy cabbagesonionscarrots or eggsjust give a little thought as to how these came to be on the shelves the early planting and worrying about frostspacking and carting to the shopsIt must be a headache with all the work involvedIt's still worth looking for English labels on the vegetables and fruit do try to support the good old English varietiesTo see and support British effortone has only to look at the Chelsea Show which starts on May 25where the National Farmers Union stand is so impressive with the huge pyramid of vegetablesfruit and flowersIt makes me so cross when I see so much imported fruit and vegetables in the shops when we have as goodif not better English produce on handWhy is it that housewives still buy tasteless fruit from Common Market countries when English varieties are availableI suppose it boils down to cheapnessOnly recently we have heard of the mushroom factory near Eye in Suffolk having to close down as mushrooms could be brought in cheaper from IrelandSomething must be wrong whenalthough they have to travel further they are coming in cheaperNo wonder our country seems to be in such a messIf you visit the show next week and note down all the East Anglian

told to come clean over claim of sell-off hitlistAN ESSEX MP yesterday urged the Prime Minister to come clean about a sensationallist of Government services which it is believed he would like to place in private handsAndrew MacKinlayLabour MP for Thurrocksaid he believed the Government was now heading for a crazy course of actionto privatise services even with a high security contentMr MacKinlay said he had heard of the existence of a list of servicessome of which appeared in The Observer newspaper yesterdayGovernment sources declined to confirm or deny the contents of the listbut MPs believe some of the services will almost certainly figure in the Queen's Speech setting out the legislative programme for the next session of ParliamentThe list includes courts services such as the issuing of summonsesprison service recordsthe police data centre at Hendon and collection and publication of vital economic statisticsOther likely candidates include prison canteensthe Endangered Species Unit of the Environment Departmentten-yearly censusdistribution of welfare foodspayment of civil service and teachers' pensionsawarding and paying student grantsCompanies House and the Insolvency Serviceand the Northern Ireland Government cars serviceSecurityMr MacKinlay saidI believefrom what I have heardthis sensational list is trueI find it breathtaking after the Group 4 fiasco they should even consider privatising those things which have a security contentThe whole exercise is repugnant at a time when the popularity of privatisation is drastically on the waneThe Prime Minister must make known what the Government's plans areThe sooner we know for certain what we believe to be truethe sooner we can mobilise against themFour arrested in drugs squad raidFOUR people arrested during a raid

Tony NewtonBraintree MP and Leader of the House of CommonsMr Henderson said the water authority is committed to cleaner riversbeaches and purer waterIt was necessary to increase charges and most people were even willing to pay a little moreMr Newton said the extensions will help meet demand from increasing housing and industry in the districtThe new works was originally an old depot and now treats waterfrom two borehole 100 metres down on the sitefor 35,000 customersThere has been a waterworks at Bocking since 1912and the two boreholes now extract five million litres of water a day which is then pumped to the Panfield reservoirwhere it is mixed with water from other sources at Petches BridgeCodham and Notley RoadProtester Richard Keeblea Labour member of Braintree District Councilsaid the number of people having their water supplies disconnected which they put at nearly 2,000 meant more would be suffering from ill health including dysenteryIt can affect their children's healthhe saidThe water supply is a natural resourceIt should not have been privatisedThe protesters were also angry about the high salaries of the chairman and managing director of the privatised water companyand the high annual cost of waterHoweverJohn Sainsbydivisional manager for Anglian Waterrefuted their chargesHe said their figures applied to five other water authorities as well as AWand said

weather as high pressure areas move inEditors still believe the royal family sells newspapersWhen ethics go out the windowOn May 27declares the press release for James Whitaker's new booka major news story is going to break concerning the marriage of the Prince and Princess of WalesThe story broke all rightbut two weeks earlier than plannedthanks to the spoiling tactics of The Sun James Whitaker works for the rival Mirror and his book was due for serialisation in that paperThe Sun decisively sabotaged what should have been a major circulation booster for its main competitorThe best-kept publishing secret of the year is set to become the best-seller of the decadedeclared that press releaseThe secret wasn't so well-kept after allSo will the bookrushed into the shops as events overtook itbe a best-sellerAndrew Morton became a millionairethanks to the runaway success of that bookas his DianaHer True Story is apparently known in royal circlesHis fellow royal-watchers have no doubt all been left thinkingI could do thatWhitaker had more reason than mostsince Morton was once his apprentice on the Daily Star The doyen of the royal correspondents and chronicler of the lives of the royals for more than 25 yearsas his press release puts itis billed by the Mirror as the man who really knows the royalsPerhaps he felt he needed a best-seller like Morton's to re-establish his claim to those titlesBut questions must be asked about the ethics of a newspapermanpaid a considerable salary to give Mirror readers the latest royal newswho keeps a major news storyunder wraps for his own bookThen there is the question of whether there really was a major news storyat allSeemingly more interested in spoiling tactics than news valuesThe Sun gave the supposed transcript of an alleged row between Prince Charles and his estranged wife far more prominence than it deservedIs it really news that a couple on the brink of separation should be arguing about the custody of their childrenThe suggestion that the buggingmay have been the work of the security services is already largely discreditedas is even the authenticity of the tapeThe fact that the Palace has issued a denial is highly significantthere was deafening silence about earliermore damning tapesSo we have a story that may or may not be a story it had already appeared in The People back in Januarywhen it raised few eyebrowsand a news reporter who suddenly finds himself giving press conferences rather than attending themAnd the subject still won't go awayOn May 27the date Whitaker's book was planned to hit the shopsat least another two more controversialbooks by prominent royal watchers are also scheduled to appearOne is by the Mail's Nigel Dempsterthe other by journalist and biographer Anthony HoldenThe Tarnished CrownCrisis in the House of Windsor is perhaps the most significant work ever written on the House of WindsorDaily Express May 8and promises to fan the flames of royal debate like no other publications since Andrew Morton's DianaHer True StoryThe TimesMay 3 Does that all sound depressingly familiarIt is undoubtedly a good thing that royal reporting has moved on from the tradition of deferential reverence in which James Whitaker first learned his tradeBut many people would no doubt argue that the current anything goes as long as it sells papersstyle goes too far the other wayCountless columns of comment filled the heavy Sundays this weekend with yet more doom-laden analysis of the future of the monarchyAnthony Holdenwhose book contains revelations on the collapse of four royal marriagesbelieves that the 1,000-year-old monarchy is in perilBut is it reallyWho is more in touch with the mood of the public the tabloid editorsor the broadsheet punditsThe pundits agree that the omens for the royals are not goodthe republicans are gaining groundThe tabloid editors continue to believe the royal family sells papers better than anything elseBook publishers appear to agreeThe real irony is that ifas so many commentators suggestthe British are becoming increasingly disillusioned with and disinterested in the royal familyall these much-hyped books would stop sellingAs long as the market exists and tabloid sales are a healthy indicator the throne is apparently in no danger at allTabloid warshow last Wednesday's Sun spoiled Thursday's Mirror world

policy is to vote in local elections for the person whoin my opinionis going to serve the locality bestregardless of political viewsbut how can one vote without some knowledge of who is putting up for

thousands of options for change being offered to women at Colchester Town Hall on an Education Day organised as part of this year's Adult LearnersWeekAdviceprospectusesfact sheetshelplinescareer and benefits expertscourse counsellorsbusinesswomenand mature returners and learnerswho had been through it all and come out strongerwere all there to persuade women learning is for life and it's never too late or too hard to startThe eventthe first of its kind in Essexwas organised by Colchester InstituteGreyfriarsand Essex University and partly funded by Essex TECIt was part of a nationwide celebration of the six million adult students currently giving themselves a second chanceWomen are a key targetThey are still occupying the lower status jobsand bringing up a family has often meant interruptions to education or professional trainingIn the current economic climatemany are having to return to work and need to update their skills and boost their confidenceWomen's expectations are also higherTheir ability and desire to get an education and earn a living for themselves has been one of the most dramatic changes in recent yearsYet in spite of the drive to encourage adults to invest in new skillsnot all will find the pathway to learning a smooth one and women in particular still have to overcome considerable obstaclesApart from the difficulty many find in accessing informationthe chief barriers to success are three foldfinancialdomestic and psychologicalThe financial difficultiesaccording to Clare Hawkinsadult education advisor at the Colchester Instituteare considerableThe decision by Essex County Council to cut all part-time grants will hit women particularly hard and single parents hardestMany keen to set up in business will also be hampered because they have been unable to build up capitalShe saidWomen are now having to support themselves and for women on lower incomes or on income support participating in education is an impossibility unless they have savingsThe cost of child care is another barrierWomen might be able to scratch together the fees but they can't pay for the child coverAs for the psychological barriersthe chief one is lack of confidenceIsolated at homeand without a network of contactsmany fail to recognize and market their own skillsMany also feel inadequate because they believe they lack the right qualificationsMrs Hawkins saidIt doesn't take long out of the workplace to lose confidenceEven short periods at home with small children seem to destroy women's faith in their own abilityWomen say to me they haven't done anything for the last ten years and it turns out they have had four childrenrun the PTAserved as parent governordone charity workorganised a community activity and cared for aged parentsSome who enrol on a course may also find managing their work load and domestic arrangements traumatic and feel guiltyundermined by lack of support from partnerparents or children or emotionally blackmailedHowevergiven the difficultiesthe success rate is high and the rewards for women are clearClearly the major spin-off is the feeling of self-worth and self-esteemsaid Mrs HawkinsEducation isn't about knowing things but about how you feel about yourselfThe actual process of thinkingdiscussing and planning brings about this enormous enhancement of self-beliefMothers break through guilt barrierDegree opens up new lifeSEVEN years ago at the age of 41Carolyn Scott moved to Essex and started a full-time philosophy degree at Essex UniversityIn her last year she shared a flat with a 70-year-old mother-of-seven from Waleswho was doing history finalsShe now works in the university admissions officeMrs Scott saidIt brought me out of myselfIt was the best three years in my lifeI didn't do a degree with a career in mindI did something I wanted to doIt was hard work but brilliantOther students didn't treat me as a mature student and I got to know students aged 17 to 70I had a very good social life and made about six really good friendsI made a new life for myselfI got there on one A-level and kept thinking I shouldn't really be hereI spent the whole of my first year waiting to be tapped on the shoulder and told they'd made a mistakeYou do lose confidence when you spend years and years at home with childrenWomen aren't encouraged to be as confident in themselves or as single-minded the way men areWomen always apologise moreMy son was 18 when I moved down here and I left him with grandparentsFor the first term I felt guilty I'd abandoned him even though he'd told me to come and could stand on his own two feetIf someone is thinking about going back into educationI'd sayGo for itJust be confident you have the abilityAn awful lot of women have but aren't told soMature students usually end up doing better they're there for the right reasonsChangeAs a divorced mother-of-two and approaching 40Jacqueline James had to face up to going back to workHer first career as a hairdresser no longer appealed so she took an Options For Change course at the Essex Business Centre and has now completed 30 hours of a counselling courseShe saidThe Options course gave me confidence and the information you could go miles for and never find like the fact 70 per cent of all jobs aren't advertisedThat's the sort of thing that makes you realize you're not going to find the job of your dreams just by going to the job centreI learnt to be assertivehow to put together a CV and how to market myselfYou look at the skill you didn't know you hadput a label on it and thinkYes I do do thatwhereas when you first walk in you think you've done nothing for the last 18 yearsAll my school lifeI was under the impression I was not completely stupid but pretty dumb so I never had that oomphIt was only half way through my lifeI suddenly realized if you really want somethinggo for itGuiltI have changedI've learnt I'm a person in my own rightnot just someone's wife or mother and I have a right to be here and a right to pursue a career or studiesTwo years ago I got through the guilt obstacleThat's the breakthrough to realize you have a right and no longer feel guiltyI think men's attitudes are changing because we're making them change but most of the best jobs still go to the menBack to worka mother gets advice about retrainingPicture by WARREN PAGE
