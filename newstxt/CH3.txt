tamperingSpot checks are likelyCOLIN PRICESIR Colin Cowdrey admitted last nightThey're all tampering with the ballThe chairman of the International Cricket Counciltalking in Sri Lankasaid the ball doctoring issue exposed in the Mirror by Allan Lamb is cricket's biggest headacheHe claimed all countries have been guilty of tampering with the ball and concededWe don't know what we are going to doand the countries don't know the answerThe problem is that when a new trick appearseveryone is trying to see what advantages they can get from itEveryone knows that all countries try itSir Colin flies back to England later this week to try to sort out the storm over the PakistanisBut he may well have kicked up another by exposing the eight other Test-playing nationsCertainlyEngland were reported to Lord's by umpire John Holder for a marked ball during last summer's final Test against West IndiesHolderdespite rave reports from Pakistan after standing as a neutral umpire in the series against Indiahasn't umpired another England Test sinceThe Test and County Cricket Board almost managed to hush up that incident but BBC TV commentator Jack Bannister exposed it in a book months laterAnd New Zealand admit Chris Pringle became so angry at Pakistan's tricks that he produced life-time best Test figures of 11 for 152 after scuffing the ballKiwi manager Ian Taylor took the unprecedented step of telling the world what had happened because he wanted the ICC to investigate PakistanBut the ICC did what they did with Lamb's evidence last week and with West Indies skipper Desmond Haynes's complaint about them in Karachi in 1991 exactly nothingNow that Lamb has blown the whole affair into the openSir Colin must see the cheats are exposed and the door slammed forever on the ball doctorswhichever country they belong toOne suggestion is that the umpires should inspect the ball at the fall of every wicketor at unscheduled stopsinstead of the end of each over when bowlers have the chance to cover their tracesThat change might be in place by the time Pakistan visit West Indies this winterTHIS is the kind of ball doctoring of which Sir Colin Cowdrey says all

Arsenal's 30-goal Ian Wright but he ignored all the criesI plead with him to get it right this time for his own sakeBecause if his squad selection today for next week's friendly in Spain failsthen by God he will feel the full wrath of his critics and no one need tell me how that feelsI can assure Graham he will be the loneliest man in footballreviled by people who haven't the first clue about the

Charltonone of my team of 1966turns his back to criticism as manager of the Republic of IrelandHe does it his way and that's how a managerbe it at club or international levelshould actSadly for Graham we haven't got too many players of true international quality to spearhead his attack this wayThere aren't too many bigstrongmobile strikers with the skill to hold the ball and allow the midfield to feed off himCalls for Le Tissier come from some quarters because of his good partnership with Shearer while at SouthamptonI don't agreeLe Tissier is a very good club player but he has yet to prove

to hurt one of the highest paid players in the sportThe punishment doesn't fit the crimethat's for sureWe've made too many allowances for another top player who thinks he's bigger than the gameI can't buy Offiah's excuse that he needed immediate ice-pack treatment on a legA few extra minutes while he went up for his loser's medal wouldn't have made much differenceIt can't have pleased the sponsors and the whole affair overshadowed an excellent win by St Helens who are going to push Wigan all the way this seasonOffiah said earlier this week that he's a lousy loser but nobody likes to lose he's not uniqueBut it takes bottle to bury your feelings and accept defeatno matter what the competitionThe Charity Shield might not be the most important trophy but it's still a prestige event and it is used to promote the gameOffiah is fortunate to be blessed with great natural ability and he is certainly the most marketable asset in Rugby LeagueAnd with such a high profilehe should set a better exampleSportsmanship might be an old-fashioned concept to many in the modern game but it has to be protectedI'm sure I remember Offiah doing a lap of honour with an ice-pack on his leg after Wigan won the Premiership last seasonThat was in stark contrast to the previous year in the same competition when he went straight to the dressing-room after Widnes lost to HullThe Wigan club were embarrassed by Offiah and team-mate Kelvin Skerrett's behaviour at GatesheadThey've a tradition to uphold and the likes of Billy BostonEric Ashton and Brian McTigue wouldn't have acted like thatThe tragedy is that Offiah did some very good promotional work in Gateshead a couple of days before the game and then blew all the goodwillHe made a wonderful gesture by donating his jersey from this summer's third Test against Australia to the Daily Mirror's special auction in aid of stricken boxer Michael WatsonHe refused to swap it with opposite number Willie Carne after the game because he had promised it to

when chief selector Ted Dexter announces the 16-strong England tour party for India and Sri LankaIt means Lamb's worst fears will be confirmed as he discovers how his disclosure of the Pakistan ball tampering scandal has totally embarrassed cricket's governing bodythe Test and County Cricket BoardEruptedDexter dropped a heavy enough hint a fortnight ago by failing to back Lamb when the row eruptedAfter Lamb had blown the whistle on the Pakistanis Dexter seemed to want to wash his hands of anything Lamb was doing suggesting that the Northants captain's forthright comments would not just end with a fine and a suspension from his County bossesIf Lamb's sacking does not come as a major shock then Gower's latest axing is mind-blowingly baffling following his much trumpeted recall for the third Cornhill Test match at Old TraffordSkipper Graham Gooch and Gowerone of England's true post-war cricketing idolshad buried the hatchet in the wake of one of the game's most public and personalised slanging matchesThe elegant Gower had rediscovered his appetite to be both combative and successful in the Test arena and had celebrated his return after nearly 20 months' absence by eclipsing Geoff Boycott's long standing English Test runs aggregateGower's form in the last part of the serieswhen he had an average of 50should have guaranteed his ticket to IndiaYet the selectors are set to perform a mystery U-turn by leaving out their greatest modern day left-hander and most experienced Test cricketerIt is hard to believe that the hiccups over his newly published autobiography can be the real reason behind the decisionTrueGower upset the Indian Cricket Board of Control with sensitive claims about ball scuffing in the last series here two years agoBy the strict and draconian censorship standards of the TCCB it was extraordinary that these allegations were not heavily blue-pencilledGower and the TCCB were assured the tour of the subcontinent was in no danger and that he would still receive a cordial welcome in a country where he is admired and respected having beaten Sunil Gavaskar's team there eight years agoWith Lamb and Gower about to be dumped and the mightiest of all rounders Ian Botham unavailable today's Lord's team declaration will mark the sad end of an era for English international cricketIt will be the first time in 15 years that an England tour party has not included one of the celebrated triowho between them have appeared in 298 Test matchesBut if the departure of BothamGower and Lamb is a depressing thoughtthen the international comeback of Mike Gatting and John Emburey must be welcomedNow an amnesty has been granted reducing their five-year ban to a three-year suspensionthey both deserve to play againBut I cannot see any other members of Gatting's controversial South African tour being brought backNeil Foster of Essex would have made it a year ago after his spectacular haul of 106 wickets and remembering his superb bowling when he produced the performance of his life as the Test bowling hero of Madras under Gower's leadershipBut now his injuries have caught up with himdespite a brave battle to recover from recent knee surgeryWith no Lamb and no Gower I can see the chance for England's batting enigma Graeme Hick to go on the senior toureven if he has not been offered a winter retainer contractQuite

wedding to Thorrun Nash in Winchester Cathedral in a fortnighthe admittedMy words have come back to haunt meAfter forcing Gooch to eat his words by winning an England recall this summer and passing Geoff Boycott's Test runs recordGower had hoped for a late honeymoon in IndiaInstead he will meet Hampshire officials today to talk about a new two-year contractAnd Gower is bitterly disappointed not to have made the tour squad after virtually apologising to the Indian Cricket Board for alleging their bowlers scuffed the ball in the final Test at the Oval two summers agoThose remarkslike his

this summer and 44 throughout his Test career saidTo say I am disappointed is an understatementI really thought I had done enough after being recalled against PakistanGower was even more stung to learn one of the reasons for his omission was that England play eight one-day internationals on tourGraham talked about the number of one-day games and about not having too many players of over 35he

bear to watch himself in the white shirt of his countryAnd he admits he cries when he sees film of the glory days in Italy when Gazza was ready to become the best footballer in the worldThat was before his shattering injury that has taken 16 months off his careerI just can't watch myselfhe said in Santander yesterday where he has joined up with the England team to watch tonight's match against SpainI have had to throw the videos awayIn those dark days when I was recovering from my knee injury I'd play a video of an England match and upset myself all over againI have watched David Platt's last-minute winner in the World Cup match against Belgiumand a big lump came in my throatI thought a few reminiscences might help meIt didn'tJust made it worseI just wanted to go out and smash a door downJokes I will watch the game against Spain because I am not playingIt will be great just to be with the lads againI have missed it all so muchEnglish voicesthe general banterjokescomradeship and team spiritYesI have been lonelyI can't wait for the next get-togetherand the thought of pulling on that old white shirt again excites meWhen I've played a few games for Laziowhen I'm ready and the boss says I am fit to returnI will bring the whole family to Wembley to watch me againI don't think I have much else to proveother than that I want to be the best player in the worldMy knee is fineThere is no doubt in my mind that I can be the player I was before I got injuredI don't think about my kneeAll I know is that I want to give everything I have for England againGazzanow with Lazio of Rome after his £5.5 million transfer from Tottenhamexpects his first match to be against Spurs on September 23By then he should have fully recovered from the injured right thigh muscle that has delayed his eagerly awaited debut in Italian footballAll being wellthat should be at home to Genoa the following weekHe went onI am fitI can run around a pitch 25 timesno problemI don't know what a beer looks likeI don't think about what the first tackle is going to be likeunless of course it comes from Stuart PearceOr the first twist or turnIt will mean so much just to play againI watched the European championship finals on television but I got down againdisappointed because I wasn't thereBut I kept in touch with Graham Taylor and the boysI involved myself by phoning the hotel to find out from the boss what was going onI knew I would never be fit to playbut I wanted to be part of it stillI won't put myself forward for England until I have successfully played for LazioThat would be wrongTaylor has already pencilled in Gazza to play his first match for England in the World Cup qualifier against Norway next monthGazza addedGoing back to Wembley is very much on my mindTalentIt was there that he was hurt so badlyrupturing knee ligaments in Spurs' FA Cup final win over Nottingham Forest in May last yearHe saidI will think about the thousands who will be watching and how I want to prove people wrongThere have been many doubts that Gazza couldn't make a come-back at club level or even contemplate straddling the international scene again with the outrageous talent that made him a folk heroHe saidI came to Italy for something differentTo try something newOf course I still miss the Football Leaguethe chance to get stuck inYou can't do that in Italy without getting bookedBut I just love footballI like training and enjoy working out twice a dayBut Gazza admits he missed Lazio's 3-3 draw with Sampdoria on Sunday that kicked off the Italian seasonWhere were youhe was askedDid you go shoppingNohe grinnedI was at homelooking to make babiesGazza is slowly but surely learning the Italian languagemaking it work for himHe saidThere was a dog barking outside my houseIt kept on and onI shouted at it in English but it kept onSo I went through my phrase-book to search for something like Shut upI yelled out SilenciobastardoThere was immediate silenceThe old grin is back on his faceThat old confident strut and swagger has returnedHe saidI am nearly thereso nearly fitso closeIt's been a long time and I am not going to rush itPleased Being with the English lads again has made me realise just what I have been withoutThey were all so pleased to see meNobody went on about my injury just asked me how I was getting along in ItalyGazza cannot wait to be one of them againAnd you cannot help keeping your fingers crossed for himTHE ANGUISH OF DEFEAT ENGLAND'S World Cup exit was a sad occasion for Gazza but he's desperately keen to pull on that old white shirt againGAZZA limbers

LANGLEYA MIGHTY blow for honesty can be struck today at Lord's nothing is required beyond the crowd rising as one for Allan LambI'm not proposing a massed demoThe headquarters of cricket isn't the place for howling mobs with bannersI'm not callingeitherfor sporadic barracking or bricks through the Long Room windowsThe great day of a NatWest Trophy final is certainly not the time for thatBut a serious point can be made with dignity by thousands of spectators simply standing to applaud Lamb whenas the toss dictateshe either leads Northants down the pavilion steps or walks out to face the Leicestershire attackThose fans today should not waste their opportunity to show the ICCthe TCCBthe MCC and all other initials conveying infirmity exactly what the public think of official evasivenessPakistan doctored the ball in the Texaco Trophy at Lord'sbut the authorities admit nothingEvery particle of evidence remains under lock and keyThe umpires' statementthe match referee's rulingeven the allegedly mistreated ball itself although I wouldn't be surprised to hear it's disappeared in a burglaryWe'd know nothing of that damaged ball but for outspoken Allan LambHe defied suspension under a gagging contract imposed by the counties on their cricketers but whichI feelthe players should have refused to signThey'd been duped into believing the gag nothing may be published without sanction from Lord'sprotected themBut wouldn't cricket have been better served by frankness from the outset and an early investigation of suspicions concerning PakistanMy postbag is the proof that a season's secrecy until Lamb forced some overdue action has exposed professional cricket to the public as a game prepared to condone or cover-up cheatingA game that shrugs its shoulders while figuratively dropping Exhibits A to Z down the nearest gridA game where the Test and County Cricket Board yearns for powers that would allow Allan Lamb to be hung in chains as a warning to all whistleblowersThe TCCB meet two weeks' after today's final to decide on what further punishment can be meted out to Lamb on top of a two-match ban and threat of expulsion from the England dressing-roomI say they shouldn't get away with thatI say you fans at Lord's can shame the TCCB into a re-thinkSo let's it hear it this morning for Allan LambStand up and be counted for fair play and

written in a newspaper columnIf England are switching to kick-and-rush footballyou can count me outSo-called direct tactics wouldn't be good enough to beat the best teams at international levelI've

BradfordBRIAN CLOSE ON THE BIG YORKSHIRE BUST-UPI've been stitched up by the Richardson gangJOHN EDWARDSBRIAN CLOSEI WAS ready to turn my back on Yorkshire and end an association stretching back 40-odd years over the decision to sign Richie RichardsonAs I made my way home and tried to comprehend the logic of taking another batsman on boardI kept arriving at the same conclusion that I'd be better off out of itI could see no just cause for carrying on after arguing vehemently against the ideathen seeing it carriedAs cricket chairmanI was left to carry the can for a move that made no sense and was none of my doingAnd I wasn't prepared to go along with thatThere was only one thing for itand that was to sever a connection that save for a seven-year stint with Somerset in the 70s goes back to 1949The presidentSir Lawrence Byfordtalked me out of it yesterday by imploring me to stay and fight my corner rather than walk awayHeavyI saw sense and decided I wouldn't take my bat home after allBut I did it with a heavy heartI can tell youI'm still absolutely disgusted at what has happenedbut the emotion is one of sadness and bitter regret rather than angerSeeing that ruling railroaded through made it the saddest day of my lifeI was ready to chuck it all in after a decision that flew in the face of reasonFor starterswe only decided to break down the barriers and go for overseas imports last year because we needed an out-and-out fast bowler to make any impact on the championshipBatsman Sachin Tendulkar was engaged this summer simply because Craig McDermott pulled out with an injury at the last minuteThe lad has done a lot for the club out in the middle and in the dressing roombut hasn't answered our prime need someone to knock over the oppositionNow we've signed up Richardsonwho may be the world's number two batsman but will do no more than Tendulkar to sharpen our cutting edgeAnd I'm haunted by the fear that we're going to pay a hefty price for ignoring the claims of Kenny Benjamin and Anderson CumminsThe detractors say they are relative newcomers who would have constituted a gambleHostBut try selling that argument to the counties who took on Mike

square at 1-1Gough got his marching orders from Dutch referee Mario Van Der Ende when he caught the ball during a devastating Swiss assaultThe day had started in farce when keeper Andy Goram somehow lost his passport on Scotland's team coachOnly hurried negotiations between the Scots and the British Embassy produced the necessary clearance papers in time for the keeper to playAnd within two minutes of this Group One clashGoram must have been wishing his accreditation hadn't come throughSwiss midfielder Alain Sutter was allowed to run hard at the Scottish rearguardforcing Gough to concede

formulating a teamThere is no beliefno convictionno flairno inventiveness andwith no goals in Santanderno hopeThe case for Taylor to vacate his position has been strengthened by the pain here in Spain of a shabby England performance after the torment and failure in the European championship finalsTo avoid any more personal suffering I say he should contemplate going now to give his successor the chance to build a proper team to qualify for the World Cup finalsTaylor has turned into public enemy number oneTwo years ago he was clearly the right man for the job now few would support that motionTaylor suffered only his third defeat in 25 gamesbut each reverse has been harder to takeFirst it was defeat against the Germans at Wembley to end a 12game unbeaten runNext it was against the Swedes when it really counted in the European championshipThere were debuts for Paul InceDavid White and David Bardsley last night and there are sure to be even more changes for the opening World Cup qualifying tie against Norway at Wembley on October 14SetbackThe Football Association are sure to be unswayed by this set-backas they were by the failure to score in the opening European championship games against Denmark and France and then by the defeat by SwedenBut by the time Taylor approaches the return tie with Norway on June 2England's participation in the World Cup finals in 1994 is sure to be virtually decided one way or the otherThat gives Taylor just seven World Cup ties to rescue his own precarious position or accept that the only solution is an honourable resignationTaylor boldly

Castleford's Mick Ford in a League game on August 30The incident was highlighted on Sky TV and spotted by the club's committee when they watched a video of the clash between John Devereux and Keith England in the same match which resulted in both men being sent off and banned for two gamesONE IN THE EYE FOR SKYALEX MURPHY MARTIN RICHARDSBOBBY GOULDING is no saint but I'm glad the disciplinary committee only gave him two matches last night after his trial by TVDon't get me wrongI don't condone what he did in the Widnes-Castleford gameAnd the committee could have come down on him like a ton of bricksBut they obviously felt they couldn't make too much of an example of him because a lot of peoplemainly on Sky TVhad already judged the issueIt's grossly unfair for television to single out one player from one game and conduct a kangaroo court there and thenSky TV's broadcast put the whole incident in the public eyeeven though Goulding was formally cited after the Disciplinary Committee watched a tape of the game last Thursday when dealing with two men sent off in that matchUnfairThe referee didn't see the Goulding incident and he wasn't reportedWidnes bitterly complained about the unfairness of the situation saying quite rightly that if incidents like that are to be pulled out you would need 26 cameras for every playerThere were 16 other games going on that day and there could have been a score of bad incidents missed by the refereeBut the cameras were only at one game and Goulding was the sacrificial bad boyAfter he was pulled out of the tour following a four-match ban and then seeing Wakefield's Michael Jackson make the trip after picking up a similar suspensionGoulding probably feels there's a vendetta against himIf you do it for one you do it for everybodyAnd to prevent the game being faced with another can of wormsthe system of picking out illegal or violent play must be done through proper channels not after a TV judge and jury have satClubIt would mean videos of very game being studied by a panel of expertsnot connected to any clubbefore a player is citedThe four or five men on the panel would have square eyeballs ploughing through all the tapes but that's the only real way forward if we are going to be fair in all thisClubs don't like citing other clubsplayers for the ill-feeling it can causeAnd TV cameras homing in on incidents referees have

important it is and I would never stop anybody goingBut we've got to look at ways of helping Graham TaylorThe whole structure of the seasonplus the situation with World Cup and European Championship

heartbreakhis car broke down when he was looking for his ninth win of the season at the Italian Grand PrixMansell stunned the Grand Prix race world when he revealed that he was packing up only four hours before he was due to start in his 178th Grand PrixHe was close to tears when he started to read a statement in which he opened his heart as never beforeAnd even as he begana top executive from Renault-Williams tried to persuade him not to go through with itBut Mansell shook his headignored the request and readDue to circumstances beyond my control I have decided to retire from Formula One at the end of the seasonI have made this decision with some regret but not without a great deal of thoughtMansell39and a winner of 29 GPs went onAny relationship between a driver and an F1 team is vital for success and partly dependent on money because it defines how seriously the team and its backers take the driverBut those who know me well understand the importance of the human side and the mutual trustgoodwillintegrity and fair play that are the basis of all human relationshipsAll these issues have suffered in recent weeksHe addedLooking backI feel that relationships between me and the team started to break down at the Hungarian Grand PrixAnd he revealedA deal was agreed with Frank Williams before that race in front of a witness and I have to say that at the time I felt verygood about racing again with Williams in 1993Having won the championship I was looking forward to defending it with what I believe to be a very competitive carHoweverthree days after Hungary I was telephoned by a Williams directorHe said he had been instructed to tell me that because Ayrton Senna would drive for nothingIthe new world championhad to accept a massive reduction in remuneration from the figure agreed in HungaryBadly treated It was considerably less than I am getting this yearIf I did notthen Senna was ready to sign that nightI rejected the offer and said thatif these were the termsWilliams had better go ahead and sign SennaSince then relations with the team have not been goodAnd I refer to the directors rather than the scores of people behind the scenes at WilliamsI have listened to many different opinionssome well-meaning and some notand we've heard public statements made by SennaTo say that I have been badly treated is a gross understatementOf coursea team-ownerany team-owneris free to choose whomever he likes to work for himIt was a lack of informationand sudden changesthat I found disappointingIt all comes down to fair playor the lack of itMoneya trigger for the problems after Hungary is now no longer an issue for meAs for myself I know that I am not yet ready to retire completelyI still love motor racing and I still want to winSo I may look at the Indy Car World Series in America and see what opportunities are available if anyLaterFrank Williams wouldn't reveal whether he had made last-ditch efforts to persuade Mansell to drive onAnd he would only say I'll be having something to say later on in the weekSenna admitted yesterday after his third win that he has been having talks with WilliamsBut he is likely to be kept out of the team

Footballers' Football Showwhich also included Liverpool community liaison officer Brian Hall and former skipper Mark Lawrensonand which was hosted by presenter Richard KeysDebateWe pick up the debate at the point where Hall suggests Liverpool boss Graeme Souness was under too much pressure to make rational decisionsBRIAN HALLAt that particular moment in time we have a manager that has got himself into the semi-final of the FA Cuphe's got the opportunity of reaching Wembleyhe's had a difficult time in the Leagueit's been a traumatic season okaythen he's told he needs triple by-pass surgery at the age of 39There aren't many people in the world that are actually going to make solidrational decisionsI don't think so under those sort of circumstancesTOMMY SMITHSo you're saying his decision to have this operation and to actually sell it to the Sun came all within five secondsHALLNowhat I'm saying Tommy is that Graeme has subsequently apologisedhe's made apologiesI think we ought to make

what's happening elsewhere that we're beginning to hear and read about and that's never been the case at Liverpool previouslyeverLAWRENSONNo but I honestly believe that there are certain members of

sudden eight games into the season and we hear supposedly all of the storiesHow many games are there left34You knowI don't think he Sounesshas been able to pick from all his players every week certainly probably for 18 months since he's been thereSo I think it is a bit early to pre-empt thingsSouness was then accused of trying to run Liverpool on the same lines as an Italian clubSMITHSouness seems to be changing an awful lotIf he wants to do it his way and he succeeds then greatbut so far it hasn't been that successfulI know that Liverpool won the FA Cup thanks to Phil and his reservesbecause most of the reserves were playing in most of the games last year with all the injuriesThere's a big question mark about how Liverpool trainThey go on pasta diets nowIf food's got anything to do with it then I must have been eating the wrong way for the last 40 yearsAn awful lot of things are changing which is foreign to Anfield because it used to be a very friendly

nightHumble Spora arrived at Hillsborough with a reputation as one of the tiniest of this season's European minnowsThey attract crowds of 450 for their home matches in the Luxembourg league and brought 26 fans with them for this UEFA Cup first round tieBut that didn't stop them reducing Hillsborough to a stunned silence by answering Chris Waddle's eighth-minute opener with an equaliser two minutes laterRicco Cardoni robbed Peter Shirtliff and set up Joao Cruz for a simple finish that had Spora's fans all 26 of them dancing with delightThat followed Waddle's first goal for Wednesdaya low left-foot drive from 20 yardsAnd it left Wednesday rattled until veteran campaigner Anderson took charge midway through the first-halfThe 36-year-old defender who won European Cup medals with Nottingham Forest in 1979 and 1980 restored Wednesday's lead with a header from Waddle's 22nd-minute crossAnd he struck again in the 29th minutechesting down a Trevor Francis cross and firing past the keeper from 12 yardsWednesday completed a burst of three goals in nine minutes to go 4-1 upCarlton Palmer sent make-shift striker Paul Warhurst clear in the 31st minute for an explosive finish that finally removed any Wednesday anxietyCurlingThe vastly-experienced trio of FrancisAnderson and Waddle with 105 years and four European Cup finals between them were beginning to revel in the huge open spaces left by their part-time opponentsAnd Francis almost made it five on the stroke of half-timecutting in from the right and curling a left-foot shot just wideWednesday kept up the relentless

Liverpool's European goal king at Anfield last nightThe Welsh ace bagged four goals in this Cup-Winners' Cup romp to eclipse Sixties' idol Roger HuntRush now has 19 in European competition compared to Hunt's 17And last night's haul puts him just one behind Hunt's all-time Liverpool scoring record of 285Rushwithout a Premier League goal this seasontook all his pent-up frustration out on the unfortunate CypriotsAnd after scoring four for the first time in a European gamehe saidI'm proud and privileged to break such a great player's recordHunt was my dad's heroHe was a big Liverpool fan in the Sixties and we called him Sir RogerHunt is a legend here but if I go on and beat his all-time record I think it'll take some betteringIt's been hard going for us all in the Leaguebut hopefully this result will help bring back the confidenceRush's club landmark came just a week after he had reached a scoring milestone for his countryDriveHis World Cup hat-trick for Wales against the Faroe Islands took his international tally to 23 and brought him level with Ivor Allchurch and Trevor FordWhile Rush ended the night as the hero it was Paul Stewart who got Liverpool goingDanish star Torben Piechnikwho will complete a £500,000 move to Anfield today from FC Copenhagenhad hardly settled into his seat before Stewart made the vital early breakthrough in the fourth minutePushed up front by Souness to partner Rushthe former Spurs star showed he had lost none of his old striking instincts by evading two challenges and firing a rising drive high into the net after robbing Apollon's Scottish exile Dave KennyLiverpool enjoyed almost total domination but faced with a team who pulled all 11 players back behind the ball they had to wait until the 38th minute before adding their secondThis time Stewart ran in unmarked at the far post to score with a downward header from Jan Molby's free kickThe Rush show began a minute later when Mike Marsh wriggled his way into space in the penalty area before Rush rifled in a 10-yard chanceApollon didn't help their cause when they had Marios Charalambous sent off for a second bookable offence a minute before the breakRush completed a quick-fire hat-trick within 10 minutes of the second half starting and he owed it to Mark WaltersIn the 50th minute he produced an instinctive finish from six yards after Walters had driven in a fierce low crossAnd five minutes later he stooped low to head his third after overworked keeper Mikalis Christophi had only managed to push out a curling effort by WaltersThe sixth came in the 74th minute with Rush pouncing to punish Christophi again after he had failed to hold another Jamie Redknapp shotSurpriseApollon grabbed a surprise consolation goal seven minutes from time when Marsh upended Pampos Pittas and Yugoslav international Malenko Spoliaric converted the spot kickThat denied David James the distinction of his first clean-sheet for Liverpoolbut it will hardly raise

exceptional talents might have been rewarded with two goals in the first half here in the NeckarstadionBut after the interval the striker pulled up with a hamstring strainsignalled to the bench to come off and then gave the ball away and set up Stuttgart's vital opening goalThe whole tie turned from Leeds' grasp in that fateful moment the Frenchman will want to forgetHis first injury in English football could not have come at a worst timeAs he tried to leave the field the ball suddenly dropped at his feet and he attempted a long-range crossfield pass aimed at Gordon StrachanThe Germans cut it out and ruthlessly exploited the possession as dangerous winger Ludwig Kogl crossed along the groundCentre back Chris Whyte slipped and top goalscorer Fritz Walter expertly chipped over the

ON GARRYALEX MURPHY/MARTIN RICHARDSGARRY SCHOFIELD must keep the Great Britain captaincy for next month's World Cup final against AustraliaAnd there has to be a big question mark as to whether Ellery Hanley is effective enough to be offered even a playing role in the Wembley showdownIt will be a real kick in the teeth for Schofield if he has to make way for Hanley again as Britain's captain no matter what the set-up is at LeedsAnd there'll be uproar in Wigan if the classy Phil Clarke has to give up his No.13 jersey for HanleyI watched Hanley on TV against St Helens and Halifax and he looks to have lost the pace and mobility to close down players going away from himSaints' Allan Hunte went past him with ease and Hanley was caught out several times in midfield in the Halifax matchAussie scrum half Allan Langer is playing out of his skin at the moment and if Alfiecontrols the open spaces at Wembleyit will be curtainsFor that reason I'll be happier to see Clarke in midfield and a lot of Aussies would agreeDon't get me wrongThis is not another knocking piece on Hanleywho has been a great player for club and countryI'm just being realisticThere's a school of thought that Hanley should be given a spot on the bench and brought on in a game-breaking roleThat's worth consideringBut the right selection is vital for this gameIt's a great opportunity to win theWorld Cup for the first time since 1972Schofield was an inspirational leader in this summer's Ashes tour when he took over from the injured Hanley and he played the game of his life in the second Test win in

during the one-day match at Lord's nearly a month agoDossierOslear produced a 2,000-word dossier recording all that happened from the moment that Lamb and England manager Micky Stewart lodged complaints about the state of the ball at lunchtimeOslear was determined to see the truth told about the ball-tamperingBut for his pains he was was given a private roasting by a TCCB officialThis official was furious when it appeared that Oslear had spoken to media men about his determination to back Palmer and Hampshireas well as Lambthe only England cricketer who has had the courage to take on the cricket establishmentNow Oslear is wondering if the truth will ever come out especially as ICC supremo Sir Colin Cowdrey has failed to comment on match referee Deryck Murray's report and on the umpires' official findingsThe Umpires' Association had planned to table a motion giving an official vote of support for LambBut this was shelved when Oslear was deposed as chairmanAn umpire told meWhat's happened to Don was no reflection on his unswerving attempt to get the truth told over everything that went on at Lord'sButsadlythis may take the pressure off the ICC and the TCCB and many of their officials who seem embarrassed as though they would have preferred Lamb not to have rocked the boatBut last night other umpires stressed that Oslear had not been sacked as chairman because of his battle to support LambOne senior umpire saidDon not being voted back as chairman had absolutely nothing to do with the uproar about the ball-changingThe umpires are simply determined to have an

into a comafrom which he is only now slowly recoveringEubank saidMichael is never far from my thoughts but he'll understand better than anyone that on the day I must close out everything except the fightI'll tell him after how it wentIt should be a happy account and I take Eubank to halt the smaller-framed Thornton by the eighth roundIf the fight goes the distancethere might hardly be the

aboutOur reserve team manager Brian Sparrow is amazed at the accusations about damage to propertyHe asked the senior players if they'd seen anything as they came away from the dressing-room and they said they hadn'tApparently someone said there was plaster off the wallBut before players go out they tend to kick the wall to make sure their boots are on properlyMost clubs have scuffs around the base of their walls where players have kicked themOr they've kicked the base of a door to make sure their boot is on comfortablyIt could possible have been something like thatAnd anything that has been done if it's been done has certainly been done accidentally and not intentionallyBrian thought that the sendings-off were a bit unfortunateHe felt that there were not really any nasty tacklesHe

GIBBCHRIS EUBANK couldn't help himself the words of tribute to Michael Watson came tumbling out in a torrenta year to the Saturday since he put the brave Londoner into a comaForgottenmomentarilywere the lumps and bumps and soreness of his face after the punishment he took from game but limited American challenger Tony Thornton in Glasgow on Saturday nightToday is the actual anniversary of the tragic night in Tottenham when Eubank crushed Watson and it is only recently that the Islington fighter has started to make a real recoveryJust the mention of his name started Eubank offWhat a blinding manand I'm so very pleased that Michael is seeming to make an amazing recoveryI've spoken to him a few times and he's the epitome of a true warriorHe still wants to fightbelieves he still has it in him to fightHe's still sharphas a sense of humourhe's wittyHe's bitter about what happened he didn't want to loseHe hated thatBut I got punched to pieces that night and the only reason I won the fight was that I could still keep going in the 12th roundBrilliantSince that day it hasn't looked too good for Michaelcertainly not five or six months agoNow he's brilliantHe said to meBring the championship belt and a cameraI'd willingly give him the belt but he wouldn't take itThe difference between us is that I don't like this boxing business and he still loves iteven nowHe keeps telling me that I must fight every contender and mustn't dodge anyoneHe says as a champion I must perform well and give the public value for moneyThen he saysAre you ready for the re-matchAre you up to itHe's still a warrior in his mind and you can't break his spiritHe will keep on trying to finish on his feetYet questions have to be asked quite seriously about whether Eubank himself can maintain his work-rate with a tenth world title fight lined up in just 24 monthsHe faces yet another challenge for his WBO super- middleweight crown in Manchester on November 28But I think it's all to do with Watsonthe man he now respects so muchEubank would fight every week if he could to make his fortune secure as soon as possibleYet on Saturday night he may have run away from a million dollar showdown with Iran Barkleya man Nigel Benn once conquerednow the IBF champion at 12 stoneBarkley's handlerStan Hoffmanwas in Glasgow to run the rule over Eubank and he wasn't impressedHe saidI could not sell a Eubank-Barkley fight in the States after that performanceAll that running away in the last couple of roundsit was crazy an American TV audience wouldn't like itEubank's promoter Barry Hearn may have different ideasand is thinking of trying to put Barkley on against Eubank in BritainThat's even though the British Boxing Board have already ruled out Barkley from fighting here because of eye retina damageIf that fell down Hearn might think of staging such a fight in FranceBut that wouldn't happen until some time next year when Eubank could also be facing Nigel Benn especially if Benn lifts the WBC title in Italy next monthEubank looked as though he was going to finish off Thornton in the ninth round and should have done so in the tenthBut he admittedI couldn't stay with his pace and I had to get away and look after myselfThornton was not impressed by that tacticHe saidWhat was the speed limit in the ring during those last couple of roundsHe ran his ass offIt must be wondered whether Eubank is jaded through having so many fights at a high level in such a short timeBut it won't get any easier as Hearn promisesWe're only going to fight sluggers and tough guysThat may sound mercenary because Chris knows the rest of his career is limitedbut it will be fun for people watchingEubank insistsI HAVE to fightI NEED to fightI WANT to fight on November 28Yet even Eubankdeep downdoes question his continuation in a sport that he has never really likedHe saidIt's nice to have a record of 33 wins in 33 fightsbut in a way it is becoming tedious and I'm tired of winning all the timeYou can have too much of a good thing but the alternative is quite unacceptabledefeatIf he keeps pushing himself so hardthat unacceptable facet of boxing might have to be faced sooner or laterThornton

that I can remember and in trying to get himself out of it he has at times become even more bogged downBut with injuries that have cut the heart from the sideSouness has had to buy and he's not always been successfulWhile the critics are erecting the hangman's gallows for himit is his players who have let Liverpool downI see no captain on the bridgeno leaderno will to win or passion to play for the

bought who had nothing to do with the Liverpool way of lifeSuddenly Souness had to start from the bottom and try to build not just from an injury-decimated sidebut from one whose senior players were in the most part over 30 and past itHe has tried to draft in fresh facesand found it difficult for them to fit inI don't fancy Mark Wright as a skipper or even a centre halfHe has gone backwardsBut who else is thereNo wonder Souness has been into the transfer market for a new centre backAnd what about Mark WaltersHe shows nothing that suggests to me he should wear a Liverpool shirtI see no heart and soul for the jobI know critics will say that Souness picks the teamand they reflect his selectionBut he hasn't much of a choiceHe has had to play kids because the cupboard is bareAnd the stars he does have are not going to get any betterSouness doesn't have any money to spend like Dalglish didHe has had to gamble on selling before he can buythat's why he got rid of first Ray Houghton and then

our readersThe Mirror cannot kow-tow before a disciplinary tribunal whose feudal justice was dispensed from the appropriate setting of a committee room tucked between a Real Tennis court and the

deadest of bats latelyHe has been stonewalling throughout the whole month since Lamb told the worldthrough the Daily Mirrorhow the Pakistanis scuff and scrape and scoop at an old ball until it swings as though it was factory freshI can't see that Cowdrey knew what was going on among the fielders while Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram bowledBut if he didn't find outhe's out of touch and shouldn't be in his high officeEverybody else in cricket claims to have been aware and says so readilyBut they always do so anonymously because every playing contract contains a self-signed gagLamb alone tore that

telling the truth £5,000 and £1,000 costs yesterdayin addition to an earlier £1,800 by NorthantsNit-picking legalists and how that tribunal looked loaded with them will say the two fines for one offence are not because Lamb exposed PakistanThey will say Lamb is being roasted for breach of contractMaybe there are some people gullible enough to believe thatBut you won't find Daily Mirror readers among their ranksWe knowdon't wethat Lamb hasn't been fined so heavily for breaching a harsh contractHe has been fined for exposing a wrong that England and Pakistan seemed happier keeping

a three-year periodThe Test and County Cricket Board acted only hours after fining Allan Lamb five times as much for exposing Pakistan as ball-gouging cheatsSpokesman Ken Lawrence saidWe are determined to stamp out what little ball-tampering there is in the domestic gameA four-man panel imposed the heaviest fine in their power but it will only be paid if Surrey's bowlers are involved in another incident within two yearsThe flash-point that finally forced Lord's to act came last month while Waqar was away on tour with PakistanBut the world's most devastating fast bowler played in two other matches when umpires reported Surrey to Lord's under Law 42.5 which exclusively governs unfair playStruggleHe destroyed Yorkshire's second innings at Guildford with six for 40 last year but struggled to break through against Gloucestershire in a drawn match at Cheltenham in 1990Last night Surrey skipper Alec Stewartthe England vice-captainwho appeared before the tribunalsaidI have absolutely no comment to makeon the instructions of SurreyLord's secretly warned Surrey in writing at the end of the 1991 seasonBut they ran into trouble again during a 72-run defeat by Leicestershire at The Oval last monthUmpires Barry Dudleston and John Holder the man who reported England for tampering with the ball on the same ground against West Indies last year changed the ball because it had been suspiciously scuffedStewartSurrey coach Geoff Arnold and secretary David Seward were all summoned to Lord's for a disciplinary hearingDonald Carrchairman of the panelsaidSurrey were given a warning last year for repeated offences and that is why the matter was reported to the disciplinary committeeLawrence addedIt must be stressed that we do not see ball-tampering in our domestic game as a serious problembut we are determined to stamp it outMessageThere is nothing that cannot be coped with by the co-operation of captains and the vigilance of the umpiresI am quite sure that the message has gone home to the counties and their bowlersAnd after all the controversy involving Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis this summerLancashire and Surrey will be well aware that people are going to be looking at their performancesBut I can assure them our umpires will be quite even-handed about checking all bowlersSurrey's problems started during the 1990 drawn game at Cheltenham when umpires Chris Balderstone and Barrie Leadbeater changed the ball because it had been tampered withDuring the Guildford Festival week in 1991 umpires Don Oslear and Bob White considered the ball had once again been tampered withBut they didn't change it because the only one of similar age available to them had been used in the previous match when Waqar took seven for 87 against GloucestershireAnd the umpires considered that to be in too poor a conditionto useOne leading umpire told meAt last it seems the Board are ready to back up the umpires in this matterDealWaqar recently signed a three-year deal to

Taylor does not yet understand just what the £5.5million star can do for English footballI know Gazza is not yet fully fitBut England need his creativityhis inspirationandmost of allhis sheer blinding

dressing-room before the kick-offroughly shook himand demanded he die for the club and the causeTaylor says he does not want to get involved in emotional situations but football is about emotionand it disappoints me that Taylor does not want to show hisGazza should now be encouragednot discouragedand then disillusioned to find out that he is to be overlooked until next FebruaryGive Gazza beliefand he'll hand over his heart and soulEngland's most endearing footballer badly wants to belong againand I still believe a half-fit Gascoigne would offer Taylor more in mid-field than has been dished up latelyDoes the England manager need to be reminded how sterile England were against SpainHow we were outplayed by BrazilHungary and CzechoslovakiaAnd what happened in all three games of the European ChampionshipIsn't it worth giving Gazza a game to find out just what he can do just what he is capable of producingI believe it would be far in excess of anything England have laid before the

intimidating place for teams to visitThere was a time when everyone hated LeedsWe were disliked because of things that had happened in the past and we didn't need any motivation when we kept hearing that sort of talkSuddenlyit's all changedPeople seem to like Leeds a bit more and while that's niceit's maybe one reason why we've relaxed and taken our foot off the pedalWe've got to start being a bit meaner on the pitch and we've got to do it nowArsenal fell so far behind at the start of last season that they couldn't catch useven though they went 17 matches unbeaten towards the endWe can't afford to let that happenso we must produce results nowLeeds have managed only one clean sheet all season and are desperate to shore up a defence that was the cornerstone of last year's successMcAllister believes it's a collective responsibilityHe saidWe've made a poor start and we have worked out whyIt's simply that while we've been playing well in possessionwe haven't been doing the job when the opposition have had the ballA lot of people have told us we've been playing better than last season but we haven't produced winning footballWe haven't worked hard enough off the ballWe're not pressing teams and making it difficult for themwhich has previously been the basis of our successWe're desperate to put that right because we don't want to go down as one-season

the Leeds skipper sprawling for a penalty in the 61st-minuteAnd when he lost possession on the edge of his own area three minutes laterMcAllister again capitalised with a near-post cross that one-time

was only a little tapLazio's doctor Claudio Bartolini explained that it will be 24 hours before he can make a true assessment of the damageGazza had to call a halt before a 46,000 crowd here in the Olympic Stadium when a challenge from Mario Bortolazzi stretched the right knee that has undergone two major operationsBartolini revealed how Gazza was scaredby the impact of the crunching challengeHe saidThere is no distortion of the kneeHe was caught on the sciatic nerve and suffered only a dead-leg and an abrasionThis has been a good test for his knee and we don't think it is a big problemBut we will need 24 hours to assess itIt's the kind of kick that would be a problem on a normal knee for only one weekI don't know if he will fit to play for Lazio next weekIt is too early to make that decisionBartolini also admittedWe were a little bit worried when it happened andof coursehe was a little bit scaredBut there is nothing to worry about nowNow he must get accustomed to these kind of kicksHe didn't ask to leave the fieldBut I said it was better for him if he didn't go backLazio may well have been planning to allow Gazza only an hour's play in any event as he tried to gain match fitnessDino Zoffthe Lazio managerdecided to pick Gazza only on Saturday and to tell him shortly before the kick-offMaybe he would have played a few minutes moresaid ZoffBut it's not a big accidentHe didn't give me the impression of being badly injuredI will see Paul's condition before making a decision on whether to play him against Parma next weekDramaZoff detailed the drama behind the scenes as Gazza was kept on tenterhooks for the past four dayswondering whether he would make his Italian debutZoff saidI wanted to make an evaluation of his condition after his appearance against Tottenham on WednesdayI wanted to wait to see if there was any reaction after that matchOn Saturday I saw he was in good condition and decided to play himWhen I told him he was playing he was movedHe showed a strong characterI thought he did quite well in the first-half of his first official matchBut of course I had to remove him from the fieldBefore he was injured Gazza showed flashes of his geniusHe

champions have to overturn a daunting 3-0 deficit at Elland Road tomorrow night if they are to get past Stuttgart and make it into the European Cup second roundNo British team have ever come back from three goals down in the history of European competitionBut Wilkinson is convinced his in-form side can do itAnd with good reason it has been done to him alreadyThe Leeds boss still shudders at the memory of his old Sheffield Wednesday side going 4-3 down to Chelsea in a League Cup tie seven years ago after cruising at 3-0 upMissionA Mel Sterland penalty in the last minute of extra time

4-3 down and wondering what had hit usI know some people will think it's Mission Impossibleand I can understand thatBut we don't think it's impossible far from itI've noticed the players have perked up a lot since the first leg in StuttgartThey are looking fresher and bouncierand I just sense there has been a lot more energy about them the past 10 daysAll the players have to lose is their self-respectand I don't think that will happenI think the attitude will be that Stuttgart will only get through over our dead bodiesWhat we will be aiming for on the night is to make sure we score first and it needn't be in the opening minutesIf we went ahead 15 minutes from time and were performingI would still fancy us to go throughMomentFit-again Eric Cantona is desperate to atone for the

78ALAN WESTTEN-TRY Shaun Edwards swept to the top of the Rugby League touchdown chart as Wigan piled on the agony for crisis club SwintonEdwards' brilliant support play earned him four tries before the break and six in the second half to take his season's tally to 15 six ahead of Halifax centre Greg AustinThe Great Britain scrum-half became only the fourth player in history to score ten tries in a match equalling team-mate Martin Offiah's club record set against Leeds in the Premiership semi-final last MayWigan's victory was also a record defeat for Swinton beating the 76-3 thrashing by Huddersfield in 1946And Edwards' ten-try haul is only one less than the Rugby League record set by George West for Hull KR against Brookland in 1905The only blot for scintillating Wigan was that Offiah handed Great Britain coach Mal Reilly a World Cup scare after limping off with damaged knee tendonsOffiahback in action against Widnes last Friday after missing two matches with hamstring

face the awesome job of wiping out a three-goal deficit against their German counterparts Stuttgart at Elland Road tonightStrachan believes they can do it provided dangerman Lee Chapman gets proper protection against Stuttgart's strong-arm tacticsThe veteran of European campaigns with Aberdeen and Manchester United revealed his concern at the rough stuff dished out to prolific marksman Chapman in the first leg a fortnight agoChapman became a target man in more ways than one as the Germans singled him out for a buffeting that went unpunished by Swedish referee Rune LarssonAlarmedStuttgart coach Christophe Daum had named Chapman as his side's biggest worry after the pre-season Makita tournament at Elland RoadsayingHe is so dangerous when the ball is played into him in the airand I don't think we are able to cope with thatStrachan was alarmed at the way the German defence manhandled the 33-year-old front-runner and got away with itAnd he pleaded for a firmer approach from tonight's refereeDenmark's Kim Milton NielsenDon't get me wrong we're not asking for any favours from the refereesaid the inspirational Leeds midfielderIt's up to us to overturn the deficit without any outside helpBut after what went on in the first legI hope we get a referee who will be strong enough to stamp out any foul playWe knew they were worried about Chappy's aerial abilityand it showed in the way they dealt with himThere were arms everywherepulling him back and tugging at his shirtand they got away with it just about every timeStrachan feels Leeds are running into form at just the right time for the most daunting task of manager Howard Wilkinson's four-year reignAn impressive 2-0 win over Everton left the watching Germans in no doubt that Leeds are in the mood to become the first British team to win a European tie from 3-0 downAnd Strachan enthusedWe're getting back to something like our old formand that's encouragingIt's a dream to stick four goals past the German champions and win the tiebut it can be a reality as wellWe've simply got to stick to our patternCHAPMANDangermanHEY REFLEEDS United's Gordon Strachan hopes the referee takes a firmer approach against Stuttgart's

troops last night trudged home from Russia after failing in a dramatic penalty shoot-outManchester United looked like they had forced themselves into the second round of the UEFA Cup when they went two goals ahead after four spot kicks when Paul Ince and Denis Irwin buried their chancesBut the Russians of Torpedo Moscow hit back when Igor Chuganov beat Peter Schmeichelwho two years ago had led his former club Brondby to penalty glory in the same stadiumSteve Bruce and Brian McClair both missed their chances and while come-back skipper Bryan Robson took the scores to 3-3 after five kicks eachGary Pallister became the man forced to hold his head in anguishBefore he stepped up for the most nerve-shattering moment of his career Guennady Grishin had kept his nerve to fire the Russians into a 4-3 advantageEngulfedEngland defender Pallister was then handed the responsibility of keeping United in continental competition butjust as they had failed in a penalty shoot-out against Videoton in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1985so they were again to be engulfed in miseryPallister tried to keep his shot low and hard but Torpedo captain Alex Podshivalov pounced on the ball to send his team mates wild with joy and leave Ferguson's battling side shaking their heads in griefEarlierwith just seconds remaining of normal timeMark Hughes had been sent off for a second bookable offence and his team mates then produced a magnificent display of courageous football to keep themselves in this tieAnd it seemed Fergie's ten man heroes had squeezed out a momentous victory until the soccer fates suddenly stabbed them in the back in the pouring rain of MoscowThey had already been unlucky with just five minutes remaining in normal timewhen Neil Webb's shot cannoned back off the foot of the postEarlier Robson's dramatic arrival five months after his last competitive encounter had an immediate effect on United's performanceSuddenly Webb looked more relaxed and Ince could drive forward with more confidenceJust after replacing the injured Danny Wallace in the 37th minuteRobson met a cross from 18-year-old Ryan Giggs but his fierce shot from 14 yards was brilliantly turned away by PodshivalovBruce was the first United man to be cautioned and later McClair and Hughes followed himbut Torpedo's histrionic reaction to the visitors' tackling rarely impressed referee Jan DangaardThat was lucky for the Manchester side as the Danish official turned down no less than four strident claims for penaltiesMike Phelan looked like he may have discovered a passage into the second round with a fierce drive which spun off a defender with the goalkeeper strandedThen Hughesfor so long dogged by the determined attentions of marker Guennady Fillimonovsuddenly shook himself into space before blasting from the edge of the box but Podshivalov reacted superblySchmeichel excelled himself as Torpedo's blond danger man Talalayev suddenly found himself 14 yards from goal but his cannon shot was miraculously pushed away by the goalkeeperDangerSeconds later Talalayev found himself in another inviting position but this time sent the ball skywards and out of dangerThen with only seconds remaining of normal time Hughes was given his marching orders for a foul on his tormentor FillimonovThe Welshman kicked the ball away and referee Dangaard dismissed him for a second bookable offenceBut while United were now reduced to ten men during that last desperate half hour of extra time they survived magnificently to force themselves into the dramatic penalty spot finale in the

playful cuff and Christophi certainly made a real meal of it by falling dramatically to the ground clutching his faceA linesman called over referee Loris Stasoggia and the Italian official had little choice but to dismiss StewartAs he walked disconsolately away the hotheaded Cypriot crowd threw several missiles on to the running track but fortunately none reached the Liverpool benchStewart's

yesteryear would have eaten you for breakfastChoppernow a successful racing greyhound breedersaidIt just sums up what a bloody idiot he is to have made a video nasty like thatEvery club years ago had a tough-tackling defender in their side but they didn't resort to the tactics he is talking aboutI might have kicked a few people in my timeand some would say I got away with it for twenty yearsBut I never grabbed anyone by the gooliesPlayers who whack someone when the play is up the other end of the field are cowardsI would like to have seen how brave he is with players like Ron Yates and Norman Hunter aboutTo my mind he's slow and lacks one big asset that every professional footballer needs abilityHARRISScornYOU'RE A PLONKER VINNYTOMMY SMITH PUTS THE BOOT INTO PSYCHOVideo was an insultBan him for two yearsRICHARD TANNER/TOMMY SMITHANGRY Tommy Smith last night branded Vinny Jones' controversial new video a sick publicity stuntLiverpool's legendary Iron Man believes the FA should come down on Jones like a ton of bricks for his shameful outbursts that glorify cheating and thuggeryJones was yesterday charged with bringing the game into disrepute for boasting about his sickening and cynical philosophy towards the game on the tape titled Soccer's Hard MenSmithone of the tough nuts that Jones salutesreckons Wimbledon's Psychohas gone well over the top on his vulgar video nastyHe stormedThe FA should suspend him for a couple of years and if they can't ban the video then they should fine him every penny he makes out of itI'm insulted that he's even talking about me on the tape and I'm sure the other players he's mentioned feel the sameI was asked to do a promotional picture with him for the video launchbut I refusedI didn't want anything to do with him or the tapeImage I wouldn't mind if it was someone I respected as a player and a hard-manBut in my book he simply can't playAs for his hard-man imageall I'll say is that he wouldn't have lasted five minutes in my dayThe fact he's making a living in the game now is a sad reflection on the lack of true quality in football at the momentVinny should count himself veryvery lucky to have made a lot of money out of football without having any abilityIt amazes me he should now want to kill the goose that has laid him the golden eggHe's moved from Wimbledon to LeedsSheffield UnitedChelsea and back to the Dons for around £3millionAnd yet 15 or 20 years ago he would still be playing non-League stuff and carrying a hod around for a livingThe only reason so many clubs have signed him must be because he's a good motivatorBut he's kicked football in the teeth with this tapeIt's just a cynical publicity campaign to promote himself and sell more copies of the videoIt insults the great players he mentions from a by-gone ageand doesn't do Vinnyhis club or football in general any credit at allNo wonder his chairmanSam Hammamhas hit the roof and called him a mosquito brainIt isn't jealousy on my part because at least I could kick a ball straightYou don't play 600odd games for Liverpool and help them win European trophiesLeague championships and FA Cups if you can't play a bitVinny's not fit to lace the boots of the players he talks about on the tapeThey may have been hard but they could all play a bit as wellHe couldn't have lived with people like Billy BremnerJohnny GilesNorman HunterDave MackayRon Harris and Nobby StilesHe doesn't know anything about hard menHe's not crafty enoughhe hasn't got the brains and most of all he hasn't got the abilityOnce a hod carrieralways a hod carrierHe doesn't offer anything to the gameHe hasn't got skillhe doesn't make runs off the ball and he doesn't even tackle properlyThere's an art to tackling and it's nothing to do with the elbows in faceseye-pokingtesticle-grabbing and raking opponents down their Achilles tendons that he talks aboutIn my day we went out to break an opponent's concentration not his legThere were plenty of verbals intended to frighten the life out of someonebut it disturbs me that Jones is talking proudly about hurting playersHe should have been banned for life for the disgraceful tackle that effectively ended the career of Gary Stevens at SpursHe tackled a player who was getting up after a challenge from someone else on the touchlineHow he ever got away with that I don't knowI was no angelbut I was sent off just twice in over 20 years in the game and on both occasions it was for having a go at refereesNobody went out with the intention of hurting anyoneBut Vinny talks as if everything is pre- meditatedPsychedVinny has always claimed the Wimbledon players psyched out the Liverpool team in the tunnel before the 1988 FA Cup finalThat's ludicrousI'll tell you this if they had tried that on with the Liverpool team of the mid-1960s that included Ron YeatsIan St JohnGerry Byrne and myself the match would never have taken placeWe wouldn't have taken thatWe'd have sorted them all out in the

a drugs storm in GermanyAnd he is known for his after-match tantrumswhich include an incident when he kicked down an advertising boardThe 38-year-old Daum blurted out his drugs secret in a hotel bar after Stuttgart had beaten Hanover to win the German Super CupDoping in the Bundesligascreamed one newspaper headline the next day and Daum backtracked fastNo club dopes its playershe insistedI explained myself badlyDaum claimed that his players had been given the new sports designer drug Clenbuterol simply to heal persistent muscle injuriesIt had NOT been used to enhance their performanceThe Clenbuterol row was an innocent mistakeaccording to DaumJust like using four foreigners against Howard Wilkinson's men in the European Cup had been a mistakeDaum later explained his Hanover confessionsaying that he was not a doctor and that he had mixed up one or two thingsBannedButsurelyhe must have known that German sprint star Katrin Krabbe was banned after being positively tested for ClenbuterolAnd this was also the drug that caused British weightlifters Andrew Saxton and Andrew Davies to be booted out of the Barcelona OlympicsThe German Soccer Federation weren't convinced by Daumthe man who was often controversial in his long association with CologneHamburg presidentManfred Ommer has been especially outspokeneven casting doubts on Stuttgart's championship winThe Federation are investigating the Daum drugs affairAnd they are looking into an incident last month when Daum angrily kicked in an advertising boardDaum now wants UEFA to accept that the rules regarding foreign players are for everyone else but not for him because he had yet another excusable lapse of memoryThe rules are specific and well-knownThey can hardly have come as such a surprise to DaumHe might just get the benefit of the doubt because his side were under such intense pressure in the last ten minutes at Elland Road that his mind was concentrated on the battle on the fieldBut Daum coollycynically and calculatingly named the four foreigners in his squad from the startAnd thatin itselfbroke the rulesIf he had no intention of using four foreignerswhy did he have them among his sixteenToday Daum hopes UEFA will not disqualify Stuttgart when they debate Elland RoadDaum said that he had thought before Wednesday's 4-1 defeat that it was possible to field four non-German

first conquerorMichael Watsonwho is slowly recovering after the brain damage he suffered against Eubank last yearYesI want the Eubank return and Iran Barkley as well because he gives me the fear I thrive onsaid BennHe'd just become the first Briton to win two world titles on foreign soil and addedI want to be the first British fighter to win three world titles at different weightsAnd now Benn

had collapsedAnd he's made it even worse just now by raking ashes that are three years oldWhyWhat's he trying to do to meHe got rid of me and that should have been the end of itBut in a book he's written he's had a real big pop at me in a sour wayAnd it's just not onConcernedFergie has been saying that he was so concerned about my life-style away from football he called in Sir Matt Busbythe club doctor and even a parish priest to try to get me sorted outWhat absolute rubbish he's gone right over the top with a load of old cobblers there and I don't know whyHe's making it sound as if I was stretched on a couchlocked in a room with a Do not disturbsign on the door while Sir Mattthe doc and a priest I have certainly never metgot to work straightening me outsociallymedically and religiouslyWhat a jokeI'm not the least bit religious so the idea of a priest having any influence on my life is ridiculousI can't ever recall even meeting a priest when I was at Unitedthough there always seemed to be plenty of them aroundAs for saying Sir Matt was called in to counsel me wellthat's sheer nonsenseI only ever spoke to him socially and not very often at thatThe great man just was not in my orbitSo I feel I have every right to defend myselfAnd I'm sure I would have left the club readily and earlier if I'd known what he was going to say laterCollisionHe's making me out to be some sort of thickbrainless loony on a self-destruct road to ruinAnd that me and my old pal Norman Whiteside were on a collision course with himthat we needed to be split upAnd with him adding that he had to get rid of a notion in football that Manchester United was a drinking clubI don't know Norman's reaction to Fergie's story but I can say they have left me with a bitter feelingAll my dreams of playing for United to the end of my career and I was on a seven- year contract vanished when Ferguson called me into his office and offered me a cash pay-off to clear out and go and do something else with my lifeRiseI was staggeredI'd only once asked for a transfer and not because of any discontent or fall- out with the clubI wanted a pay rise because I found out I was way behind most of the first-team lads and barely on much more than the apprentices' wagesIt was amazing how little the money was at such a famous and unbelievably well-supported clubAnd when I found out after a bit of dressing-room chat what the other lads were on I had to make a pointI figured that if I asked for a transfer I'd either get a rise or would be able to work out a better deal for myself if I went elsewhereIn truthI didn't want to quit United if it could be avoidedI was totally hooked on the placeBut things just went from bad to worseFerguson refers to a pub and club session that Norman Whiteside and I hadand that come Friday I couldn't train even thoughhe saidI was supposed to be playing against Queens Park RangersHe says that after he doesn't know how many reprimandsI refused to play on Saturday protesting that I wasn't fit enoughFergie's memory has failed him thereHe had already told me on the Friday at the training sessionand in front of about 20 of the ladsthat I wasn't in the teamAnd that was thatBut he changed his mind and only wanted me to play against QPR when Lee Sharpe went down poorlyBut I really wasn't fitAgonyOne of the bigger problems was that Fergie believed I was taking the mickey out of him by either cheating or going soft and feigning injuryAnd I was missing too many games complaining of a bad knee when there was nothing really wrong with itI honestly believe that's what he thoughtBut I knew differentlyI finished some games in absolute agonybut said nothing and kept it to myselfBut it worried meI trained as often and as hard as I couldas hard as anybody on the staff and that includes my old pal Bryan Robsonwho was notorious for his unflagging effort but the pain was excruciatingCrazyNo professional likes to miss the chance to play that's whyreallywe're in the game and I was no exceptionBut Fergie wanted more from me than I was able to giveWhat with that and a few crazy reports to him about my off-duty life-style flying about he decided United and me were going nowhere togetherHe wanted me outFERGUSONTough and unbendingATKINSONSorry to see him goSIR MATTWe only spoke sociallyTHE former Manchester United defendernow a vital
