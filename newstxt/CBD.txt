lighter heartsThis morningBoard of Trade President Michael Heseltine is expected to cave in to City pressureand commit the Government to contributing money to an insurance pool to cover commercial property against terrorist attackNew Lord Mayor of London Francis McWiliams is said to have played a key role in persuading Mr Heseltine to turn againThe Government's earlier reluctance to put its hand in its pocket had led property experts to accuse it of unwittingly aiding and abetting the IRA's efforts to disrupt the CityThey feared thatwithout proper coverthe City would lose out as an international financial centre as large overseas institutions moved their European offices to less-exposed capitalsLondonCity workersand Britain's balance of paymentsall stood to lose billions if that happened something the Governmentin its desire to cut public spendingseemed remarkably slow to graspThe drama blew upso to speakwhen top reinsurance companies refused to offer cover for next year against terrorist attack after counting the £800m cost of last April's expensive election night bomb in the CityLondon is seen as the insurance capital of the worldBut top insurers said terrorism was a political problem not a commercial oneso the Government should pick up at least part of the tab for future claimsIt already pays all claims of more than £220 in Northern Ireland at a cost of £680m over the past 23 yearsBut the Government was not keen to give blanket cover on the mainlandTrue to modern Tory principlesit said the insurance market should find a solution on its own forgetting that even the battered UK insurance market canand sometimes doesreject unappealing businessNot a risk we want to cover alone at any priceSorry chapsthe insurers saidMarket karma had as the old joke goesjust run over the Tory dogma and the shock has brought the Government to heelWith many companies' insurance arrangements due for renewal from December 31financial institutions had faced starting the New Year exposed to ruin should other City buildings become the terrorist targetsBut industries right across the UK faced the same riskMost City firms rent their office space from the big institutions that invest in commercial developmentsLeases are longperhaps 25 yearsand tenants agree to be responsible for general insurance and repairsPolicies usually cover such things as riot and falling objectsBut if the entire building is so damaged that it has to be torn down and rebuiltthe landlord collects from his insurer to rebuildWith terrorism suddenly specifically excludedtenants and landlords faced being left with a very expensive hole in the groundand no cover for the disruption of their businessNow the Government is set to contribute to a central fund set up by leading insurers that will meet bills for terrorist damageCompanies will have to pay between 5% and 10% more for their property insurance and the extra moneyestimated at £300m-£350mwill go into the poolThe deal covers
