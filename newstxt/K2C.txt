series aircraft engines against strong competitionDelivery of the first prototype gearboxes will start early next yearCall for fresh probe into firm Beggs accuses Dail of inactionAN Ulster MP today accused the Dail of deliberately refusing to investigate a firm which lost millions of pounds belonging to Northern Ireland peopleAlmost 1,000 of the province's investors lost their life savings when Gibraltar-registered company International Investments Ltd went bust in 1984leaving debts of £7mThe Gibraltar authorities have provided information to the RUCwho have an arrest warrant out on company head Cork-born George Finbarr Rossnow believed to be living in DallasTexasBut politicians north and south of the border are calling for the Republic's Government to start a High Court inquiry into Ross' alleged links with firms in EireThe Irish Government says the 10-year-old scandal has already been fully investigated by the Garda andunless new evidence is producedit is now a matter for the Gibraltar authoritiesButEast Antrim MP Roy Beggssays he believes the Irish Government do not want to investigate because the case could embarrass senior political figuresThey have no desire to investigate this matter properly because it could prove to have serious ramifications for a number of political parties and senior individualshe claimedI will not back any political talks with the South until I have evidence of genuine goodwill over the International Investments affairIf they had investigated thoroughly at the time they might not only have been able to identify other elements of the fraud but also help secure some of the lost assetsMr Beggs said a number of Southern politicians support his demands for an inquiry and he hoped the issue would be raised when the Dail resumes again in OctoberSome of the TDs cannot ignore the situation and it is going to become more and more difficult for Enterprise and Employment Minister Ruairi Quinn to avoid appointing a High Court inspectorDemocratic Left MEPDes Geraghtysays he will petition the European Parliament to make the Eire Government actMr Beggs said the hearing in Gibraltar which is to re-open in October could result in a move to extradite Ross from the United States if there is sufficient evidenceHe could stand trial in Gibraltar but I would imagine the RUC would wish to interview himTYNESIDENew blow for

bank charges make it important to restate the General Consumer Council's views and to put the record straight about my own commentsIn its evidence to an official inquiry five years agothe Council said that the odds were overwhelmingly in favour of the banks rather than the customerWe called for a code of practice to be given the force of lawOn FridayAugust 13I was asked by your reporter to respond to criticism of banks by the Consumers' AssociationI did not say that people were fed up with banks digging into their accounts without notice to extract chargesnor did I slamthe banksI did say that banks and building societies with current account customers were in a special position because they can deduct money directly from our accountsThis is why prior information about charges is so importantI also said that banks were not sufficiently up-front about their charges and made some suggestions for changessuch as displaying a poster in each branch and printing details on statementsThe Council hopes the banks will recognise the concerns of their customers and become more open about chargesThis will lead to greater customer satisfaction and be to everyone's benefitMAEVE BELL DirectorGeneral Consumer Council for Northern IrelandLagan sludgeA NUMBER of weeks ago Lower Ormeau Residents' Action Group raised the issue of the dredging of the River Lagan with those responsible the Laganside Corporationthe DoE Water Service and the contractorsAt a frank meeting with the aboveat which this community's concerns were forcefully putit was agreed that work would halt during our community festival and that the area would be cleaned up for the festivalTo the contractors credit this was doneHoweverduring the course of a television interview a Laganside spokesman informed the public that there was no cause for concern as the mud and filth being dredged from the Lagan was being carefully loaded into sealed lorrieswhich were then washed before being driven awayA number of points arise from this statement about sealed lorriesEither the Laganside spokesperson understands sealedto mean something completely different from the rest of usMaybe he had never actually seen the operation he was describingWhatever the reasonI think we need to knowbecauseby any definitionthe lorries being used are certainly not sealedThis will be easily demonstrated by watching one of these lorries trundling down the Ormeau Road and through the centre of townIf the spokesman risks this hazardous operationhe should stand well back from the edge of the pavement or risk being splashed by the mud and water spilling from these sealed lorriesShould you happen to be driving in the vicinity of one of these sealed lorriesextreme caution is advised as a number of motorists have found to their costsometimes the spills are more substantialI would advise the Laganside spokesman to check his facts and stop treating the people of the Lower Ormeau and Belfast like idiotsMeals out eat up
