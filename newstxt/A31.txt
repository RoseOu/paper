LawWhy we must tame the state LeviathanGreater use of judicial review would help people fight bad decisions by public bodiesAnthony Lester saysBy ANTHONY LESTERWHEN I began practice at the Bar 25 years agophrases such asjudicial review of administrative actionpublic lawor fundamental human rights and freedomssounded strange to English judges and lawyersThey described apparently alienun-English ideastaken from Continental or United States systemsSuccessive generations of politicianscivil servantsjudges and philosophers reared on a meagre intellectual diet of pragmatic utilitarianism and positivism had firmly rejected these ideas as a basis for ensuring constitutional government and citizens' rightsFor themwritten constitutionsBills of Rightsand a special system of administrative law regulating relations between government and the governed were exoticinedible fruits of the American and French RevolutionsAccording to the conventional British wisdom of the middle of the centuryour flexible unwritten constitutionour democratic Parliamentthe sense of fair play of our permanent civil serviceand our vigorous and vigilant free Press were safer and more effective guarantees of personal freedom than a Continental or American-style government of judgesA quarter of a century laterthe conventional wisdom of British mandarins looks complacentself-servingill-informedand outmoded especially in the light of the many serious breaches by the United Kingdom of the European Convention on Human RightsThe powers of British central government are greater than those enjoyed by any other democratic country of comparable sizeBetween electionsa government with a sufficient parliamentary majority obedient to its will is absolute and omnipotentBecause it is not subject to the paramount law of a written constitutionit can make or unmake any law as it choosesIt can legislate arbitrarily to deprive groups of citizens of their basic rights or freedomsto enlarge its own powers at the expense of local governmentto weaken the ability of the media to inform the publicor to sap judicial independenceIt can do all these things without the possibility of legal challenge in our courtsThe common abuses of public power are not abuses by the sovereign parliament itselfThe more usual examples arise from the misuse by public officials of the powers delegated by Parliament to central or local governmentor to the many other bodies exercising administrative powersJudicial review is the process by which the courts decide whether public bodies have acted within or beyond those powersWhen judges perform this essential constitutional roletheir task is not to usurp the administrator's functionsnor to stultify good government by imposing legalistic requirements upon himThe court's job is to ensure that the administrator has acted within the rule of lawand has not infringed civil rights and freedomsBut there are significant handicaps facing the individual who wishes to apply for judicial review of the lawfulness of a public body's decisionIn the first placeunlike normal litigation between private partiesthe applicant has to obtain the court's leave at the outsetThis gives the courts a useful power to separate the wheat from the chaff among the pending casesSo long as there is a full right of appeal against a refusal of leave a right which the present Government soughtat one stageto abolish this handicap is acceptableeven though it places public authorities in a more privileged position than the ordinary litigantA less acceptable handicap is the special rule that the application for judicial review must normally be made within only three months from the decision complained ofIt is in the public interest for challenges to the exercise of public powers to be made promptlyso that the administration and citizens alike know what the law isBut it is unjust that the individual's right of access to the courts should be restricted solely on the ground that there has been delay in making the applicationAs the Law Commission recommended in 1976the test should be whether the granting of relief to an applicant who has delayed would cause substantial prejudice or hardship to any person or would be detrimental to good administrationWhat is wholly unacceptable is the denial of justice to the great majority of citizens who are not poor enough to qualify for legal aid but not rich enough to risk the costs of litigating an important public law issue in the High Courtthe Court of Appealand perhaps the House of LordsSuccessive governments have refused to implement the recommendation of the Evershed Committee in 1953 that the costs of going to law over issues of general public importance should be paid out of public fundsAs a resultmany who are genuinely aggrieved by apparently unlawful decisions by government bodies and public officials are effectively denied access to justiceThe number of applications for judicial review has none the less increased significantly over the past decadeThe process is now used in all kinds of contextsimmigrationprisoners' rightshomelessnessthe closure of hospitals or schoolsaccess to local government information andincreasinglycommercial cases with a public law dimensionThe decisions of Margaret Thatcher's ministers are struck down by the courts as often as were those of the Wilson or Callaghan administrationsMinisters and senior civil servants are not amusedRecentlysenior Whitehall officials considered whether it would be feasible to curb judicial reviewAfter discreet soundingsthey prudently abandoned the ideawhich would have involved a major encroachment upon judicial independenceThe danger is not that the courts will intervene too muchbut too littleWith a burgeoning caseloadtoo few judgesand increasing delays the courts may be tempted to block the further development of the law and to cut back on the advances already madeThe recent High Court decision in the Rose Theatre case indicates a restrictive approach to what is a sufficient interestto permit an application for judicial reviewIf that approach prevails in the higher courtsit will amount to a major reversemaking it more difficult for the ordinary citizen to complain of unlawful action by a public authorityIn the Lonrho casethe Law Lords in effect decided that the Secretary of State had no duty to give reasons for his decision not to refer the takeover of Harrods by the Al-Fayeds to the Monopolies and Mergers CommissionThe law requires public authorities to be rational in making decisionsIn the absence of reasonsthe citizen cannot know whether a decision has been rationallyand hence lawfully madeEvery independent committee of experts which has considered the subject has recognised the need to require public authorities to give reasons the current position in AustraliaIsrael and the United Statesas well as under European Community lawIt is regrettable that the House of Lords has not taken a similarly progressive approachThis is not to undervalue the change in judicial thinking which has come about in the last 30 yearsFrom the First World War until the mid-Sixtiesadministrative or publiclaw scarcely existed beyond the pioneering textbooks of Stanley de Smith and Sir William Wade QCFor 50 yearsEnglish judges had been unwilling to nullify government decisionsIn spite of the inexorable increase in the powers of the modern statethe judiciary had remained subservientas executive-minded as the executiveIt had been a dark age for administrative justiceMinisters and civil servants were naturally content to let the judges remain asleepFortunatelythey woke upUnder the leadership of Lord Denning and Lord Reidold common law principles of natural justice were given new content and valueThe judgments in notorious cases which had decided that there could be unfettered administrative discretion were repudiatedArchaic restrictions on legal remedies were eliminatedUnderstandablythe courts are more willing to review a decision because of the way in which it has been reached than because of its actual meritsor lack of themTo hold that a procedure is unfair involves a less apparent interference with the administration than to hold that the actual decision was unreasonableBut our system is defective because it lacks coherent principles for reviewing the substance of decisionsA decision will not be held to be unlawful because it is unreasonablein the ordinarynon-legal senseWhether a decision is so unreasonable as to be unlawful dependsin Lord Diplock's wordson whether it is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who has applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at itA test which requires the judge to ask if the decision-maker has taken leave of his senses is too strict and is scarcely judicialThe European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice and the Supreme Courts of CanadaIndia and the United Statesapply more sophisticated and properly judicial standards when reviewing the merits of a decisionThey consider whether the aims of the decision-maker conflict with basic rights and freedomssuch as the right to equalityto liberty or to freedom of speechThey also consider whether the means used are reasonably proportionate to the aims pursuedin European parlancethe principle of proportionalityIt is this gap between reasonablenessin the English legal senseand proportionalityin the European sensewhich leaves the United Kingdom particularly vulnerable before the European Court of Human RightsAgain and againthe European Court has noted the narrowness of the English test for reviewing the merits of official decisionsand has gone on to find a breach of the convention by the UKTwo appeals are pending against the High Court's failure to adopt proportionality as the appropriate standard for reviewIn one caseDr Colmana registered medical practitioner was prevented by the Code of Conduct of the General Medical Councilfrom advertising the nature and availability of his practice in local newspapersDr Colman argues that a blanket ban on all advertising is disproportionate to the council's legitimate aimsThe court said that to import proportionality would create a monster that could quickly get out of control and cause widespread disruption of the many administrative processes that might attract its applicationIn the second casejournalists are challenging the Government's ban on the broadcasting of words spoken by Sinn Fein supportersThey argue that the ban is a disproportionate response to the mischief which the Home Secretary seeks to controland is in breach of the right to free expression guaranteed by the European Human Rights ConventionOnce againthe Divisional Court refused to apply the criteria used by the European Court of Human RightsWhatever the outcome of those particular appeals in which I should declare my professional interest as representative of both Dr Colman and the journalistsit seems inevitable that English courtsindirectly influenced by Europewill eventually develop coherent constitutional and legal principles to review the substance of administrative decisionsThe principle of proportionality do not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut is straightforward logicAnd in the absence of a modern British Bill of Rightsthe European Convention provides a convenient source of Lord Diplock's accepted moral standardswhere fundamental rights and freedoms are at stakeIn this way we will move towards a fully developed system of public law which will better serve the interests of the state as well as of the citizenLawThe other side of the crimePat Healy on 10 years of progress by Victim Supporta national charity which has helped 1.5 million peopleBy PAT HEALYVICTIM SUPPORT has come a long way from the six-month experiment set up 10 years ago by a group of concerned professionals in BristolNow it is a national charity employing 20 people centrally and administering the work of 400 co-ordinators employed around the countrySince the national association was formed1.5 million people have been referred to Victim SupportYesterday the Princess Royal addressed its tenth birthday meetingattended by representatives of the Home Officethe policeand the probation serviceThe organisation took root because the originators of the experiment were shocked at how little the victims of crimes knew about getting assistancesays Helen Reevesdirector of Victim SupportThis included compensationlegal advicefinancial and housing helpor even simply somebody to talk toThat is still the casesays Ms ReevesTen years onI am quite sure that the biggest issue we have uncovered is the issue of neglectMs Reeves saysCrime is bad enoughBut when you have to face up to the fact that no one wants to know and people are more interested in the apprehension and sentencing of the offenderthat for many people is even worse than the original crimeNot only are victims denied immediate helpthey are subsequently kept in the dark by the police and courts about what is going onUnless they are called as witnessesvictims are often not told when a case is coming to courtThere are tons of leaflets for offendersbut nothing for the witness or the ordinary member of the publicsays Ms ReevesA former probation officershe blames the way professionals are trained to see the criminal as the main concernwith justice for the victim if thought about at allregarded as an optional extraSo victims feel isolated and ignored and find it difficult to talk about their experiencesTheir reactions can range from anger to irrational guiltfear and embarrassmentTheir families and friends seldom know how to respondPeople tend to ask how much they lost and whether or not they were insuredBut it doesn't seem to be an acceptable idea that something like burglary or a street crime can cause quite severe emotional disturbanceThe worse the violencethe less people want to talk about itFamilies where there has been a murder find that people are more reluctant to talk to them than if they had suffered an ordinary bereavement sometimes even crossing the street to avoid themVictim Support's trained volunteers offer an immediate response when people are still in a state of shockgiving encouragementsupport and informationThe organisation's original intention was to refer victims to another professional agency like social servicesbut that has proved impossibleMs Reeves explainsWith each of the really serious cases rapemurderracial harassment there simply isn't anyone to refer people on toSo we've had to do a lot of work ourselvesincluding researching carefully that we are doing something worthwhileThis research influences the way volunteers work with victims but it is also passed on by Victim Support to other organisations that might find it usefulit provides an input into every police training course in Britainand that has led to a potential new area of workFormer police officers now doing security jobs in shopsbanks and offices have begun to ask Victim Support to provide help for employees who have become victims of crime through robberies or other incidents at the workplaceNext yearVictim Support will be publishing reports on projects covering child victims of crimefamilies of murder victimsracial harassment and high crime areasIn Januaryit will launch a new court servicebased on seven Crown courts in Englanddesigned to establish the needs of victims and witnesses attending courtThe organisation is also considering how it should respond to increasing requests for help with victims of domestic violenceOne of the biggest jobs we have got to do is to pass on what we have learned to the professionssays Ms ReevesThat certainly means lawyersjudges and magistratesbut also doctors and nursesemployers and school teachersI don't see the support of victims of crime as a separate service provided by a small specialist agency but as something which should be much more widely accepted like sickness or bereavementso that people can get a more sensitive and understanding response from their employersneighboursdoctors and so onLawAlways take along a friend to sueLitigation can pay off even in the unlikeliest circumstancesStephen Gold explainsBy STEPHEN GOLDWHEN things go wrong you can sue more often than you may thinkMoney may not have changed handsSomeone may have even done you a favourIt doesn't matterAs long as you can show

26-year-old woman accountant who knew nothing about the mechanical side of vehicles asked her more knowledgeable friend to find a car for herShe stipulated that it must never have been involved in an accidentThe friend found one at a garageAlthough he failed to check it had been accident-freehe assured the lady that this was the caseShe bought itIt had been in an accident and it was worthlessIn May last year the Court of Appeal upheld a judgment against the friend for more than £5,500 damages for negligence because he had owed the accountant a duty of careYour conservatory collapses as a

mortgagethe prospective lenders will have the property valued at your expenseThere is no contract between you and the valuerBut if the valuer is negligent and you buy the property relying on his reportyou may still be able to sue him for damagesThis is what the House of Lords decided in two cases last April in spite of an attempt to get the valuers off the hook by a disclaimer which saidI accept that the valuer does not warrant anything stated in his report as being accurateAlasdisclaimers may work iffor examplethe property being valued is industrial or an expensive houseDisclaimers may also be used by referees and others to rob you of a claim for damagesWhoever attempts to hide behind a disclaimer must prove it is fair and reasonable to do soBut a disclaimer can never take away your rights under the Defective Premises Act 1972 for the collapsing conservatory or prevent anyone being sued for negligence which has caused death or injuryHave we yet reached the point at which we would be awarded damages against the Meteorological Office because we went camping on the day of an unforecast hurricaneOr after we followed the duff advice of a legal journalist in a
