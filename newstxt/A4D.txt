On the horns of the Bull Ring dilemmaThe people of Birmingham should be allowed to vote on the future development of their cityJonathan Glancey believesBy JONATHAN GLANCEYBIRMINGHAM'S infamous and exhausted retail hubthe Bull Ringjust 25 years oldhas been placed on architecture's death rowThere will be no stay of execution and few mourners for this spoiled concrete child of the SixtiesOld before its timethe Bull Ring has been accused of the systematic rape of the second cityIt also stands accused of murdering the much-loved area around the old Bull Ring market that had grown up in piecemeal fashion over the 800 years since Birmingham was granted a market charter in 1150This had survived the worst the Luftwaffe could dobut was no match for comprehensive redevelopmentThe Bull Ringcompleted by Laing Developments in 1964rammed together four levels of shoppinga market halla multi-storey car parkan office blocka bus station and a banqueting suite all in one vast complexSnaking between its constituent parts was the controversial and overwhelming city ring road designed by the successive and all-powerful city engineersHerbert Manzoni and Neville BorgThe most militant fan of Sixties architecture would be hard pressed to support a last-minute appeal for the Bull Ringalthough crocodile tears will be shed over the probable demolition of the Rotundaa monumental steel and glass phallusthatin the absence of a sky-piercing cathedralacts as the city's one instantly recognisable focal pointBut what is going to replace the Bull RingGiven the stupendous costs involvedshould the city be looking to powerful private developers working with big firms of commercial architects to take the lead and replace like with likealbeit in a more acceptable architectural garbOr should development be given over to a broad church of interest groups and realised by a catholic mix of architects working in a number of complementary stylesThe debate in Birmingham has reached something like fever pitchnow that the city council is faced with two rival development schemesOn the one side is the developerLondon & Edinburgh Trust LETand its architectsChapman Taylor PartnersOn the other is the pressure groupBirmingham for Peoplechampioned by local architect Joe HolyoakLET is in a strong positionIt has owned the leasehold of the Bull Ring and surrounding sites since 1985As LET's partner in charge of the Bull Ring projectJohn NewmansaysWe don't have to develop the Bull RingWe could just sit back and collect rents from an ever-decreasing number of tenantsInsteadwe're willing to take the risk and give Birmingham the retail centre it deserves and needs if it is not to be completely undermined by rival out-of-town attractionsThe LET scheme isin outline at leaststraightforwardIt envisages replacing the Bull Ring development with a vast new shopping complexalmost free from the graffiti-sprayed subways that have characterised central Birmingham since the mid-SixtiesShoppers approaching what LET have named The Galleries from New Street and High Street will be channeled along a brand new street flanked by granite and stone-clad pseudo-Classical shops and officesentering the new mall under a vast glazed domesecond in diameter only to that of St Paul's CathedralFrom this generous lobbylooked down on by diners perched high in the dome's galleriesshoppers will be able to pass either directly down to the open-air market in the shadow of old St Martin's churchexplore the curving three-storey shopping halls or snack in a galaxy of glitzy cafesThe attractions of LET's scheme are easy for city councillors to appreciateThe Galleries will act as a one million sq ft magnet to six million shoppersnot just from Birminghambut from the entire West Midlands conurbation and beyondBirmingham is well served by public transportwhile its frequently denigrated ring road system allows traffic to flow at a remarkably fast pace 17.5mph in rush hours compared to central London's 9 or 10mphParking for 3,500 carseither underground or else in a well disguised Post-Modern palazzowill encourage shoppers to steer away from rival retail developments in surrounding SolihullLeamington Spa and Kidderminsteralong with the out-of-town Sandwell Mall and Merry Hill CentreThe Galleries will bridge the snarling ring roadwhich will be buried in decorous tunnelsRodney Karenthe affable architect in charge of the design of The Galleriesguarantees that they will have a truly urban characterThis will not be theme park shoppingKaren insistsnor will The Galleries be closed at nightThey will form a integral part of the cityopening up new pedestrian routeswhile upgrading existing onesBut Joe Holyoak and the Birmingham for People group believe The Galleries will simply repeat the mistakes made in the early Sixtiesbut on an even bigger scaleHolyoak's attackpublished in a recent issue of The Architects' Journalis based on two premisesFirst he takes the city council to task for presenting the LET scheme as a fait accomplicriticising it for accepting without question LET's objective of redevelopment in the form of 500-metre-longinward-looking buildingHolyoak gleefully points out that architect Tony Ridellof Chapman Taylor Partnershasrather unfortunatelydescribed The Galleries as a huge aircraft carrier settled on the streetscape of the citySecondHolyoak attacks the monumentality of The Galleries whichin his words is the latest in the big developersmove to privatise city centres to eat up public space and reshape it as internalisedhomogenisedsecurity-patrolled private space'InsteadHolyoak proposes a People's Plan for the Bull RingThis consists of a return to traditional principles of town planningof conventional streetsmarkets and shopsThe People's Plan includes houseswhich the LET scheme expressly discountsA healthy citysays Holyoakneeds a diversity of uses as well as diversity of designButmore than thatthe People's Plan is an attempt to allow for incremental growth and changeIts developmentsays Holyoakwould not necessitate the great cataclysm of demolitionthe plan is designed so that parts of it can be built independently in phasesHolyoak has another trump card up his sleeveThe removal of through trafficpedestrianisationnew public spacesnew mixed usesliving in the cityenvironmental qualityremoval of subwaysall these aspects of the PeoplesPlan are city council policies contained in the City Centre Strategy published in 1987Holyoak believes that the council has been bamboozled into adopting LET's monolithic scheme which has had outline planning permission for the last yearIfhe saysthe city council grants full planning permission for The Galleries in the next few weeksit will not simply be shooting itself in the foot but blowing off its entire legJohn Newman of LET is unrepentantHolyoak talks about building houses in the centre of BirminghamBut who wants to live thereWould youI think he's lost in a Victorian vision of BritainBut what about using a variety of architects and splitting the scheme into a number of smaller related partsNewman explains that LET works with big practices of commercial architects because time and time again they come up with the goodson budgeton time and with none of the tantrums of the prima donnaLET's experience of working with namearchitects has not been very fruitfulChapman Taylor on the other handsays Newmanunderstand exactly what the retailer wantsChapman Taylor architect Rodney Karen thinks Holyoak's scheme is a case of fiddling while Rome burnsHe warnsBirmingham has to compete with outlying attractionsAt the moment all the centre offers is anxietyI see The Galleries as a focal pointa powerful force aiding the citya proper part of the centre designed to enhance its life and characterBut what sort of characterWhether Birmingham city council should push ahead with the LET scheme or stop to consider Holyoak's counterblast must turn on what sort of centre the city wantsDoes Birmingham want a centre where people live and workor a shopping complex that draws in people who live and sleep at the end of the bus routesDo they want to plan for organic change or reap the fruit of a retail giant that mightno matter what the quality of the architecturebe redundant in another 25 yearsIt is difficult not to sympathise with the People for Birmingham's schemeIt might be quixoticit might be full of contradictions and loopholes how will the traffic flow if the ring road is downgraded as Holyoak planswhy save the Rotundawhen trying to recreate a traditional city centrebut it does recognise that a city centre works best when it is the sum of a number of interrelated partsThe people of Birmingham ought to be allowed to vote on this all-important issueAre theyand do they want to beurbanites or suburbanitesBoth Joe Holyoak and his rivals really ought to knowA prayer for the brick cathedral facing St Paul'sBankside Power Station is a masterpiece worth preservingGavin Stamp arguesBy GAVIN STAMPFROM the top of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral the view is no longer dominated by City church steeples but by an intrusive cacophony of drabcharacterless Sixties boxesOne building stands out in this dispiriting panorama of post-war mediocritya dark powerful mass of brickwork with a tall central tower that stands right across the Thames from Wren's domeThis is not an office blocknor a church although its sublime form might suggest that its architect was adept at designing cathedralsIt isin factthe now redundant oil-fired electric power station that sits on Bankside next to the site of Sam Wanamaker's new Globe TheatreBankside Power Station should never have been builtIts architect had spent the war years with fellow Royal Academicians planning the orderly and spacious London of the futurefree of smoke and industryButwhen asked in 1947 to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since 1891he soon forgot such idealism andlike any architectwas glad to have the jobThe project was controversial and the power station was only permitted providing the smoke was clean and the building did not challenge the visual dominance of St Paul'sSo the single chimney rose only to 325ftsome 45ft below the height of the cross above the cathedralThe irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak scrubbersbeen less efficientthe smoke would have gone straight up into the airAs it wasthe smokeless shimmer of vapourwas so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause mischief with the leadwork on Wren's great domeBankside Power Station should not have been builtButas it was builtit should not now be demolishedThat is because it is a magnificent structurethe supreme architectural expression of the heroicmonumental phase of power station design and the creation of a great architectBankside was the work of Sir Giles Gilbert ScottOMthe architect of Liverpool's Anglican Cathedralthe rebuilt House of Commons and some of the last vital products of the Gothic RevivalHe was a designer of extraordinary versatilitybeing responsible for the standard traditionalred telephone kioskWaterloo Bridge and several power stationsBankside represents the fullest realisation of his industrial aestheticScott's first venture into this unlikely field of design was at Battersea wherein 1930he was wheeled in as a famous knighted architect by the London Power Company to try to make acceptable the coal-fired monster power station to which the residents of Chelsea and Westminster were taking strong exceptionThis was a brilliant moveScott was so successful in styling the building in fine brickwork with jazz-modernfluting as John Betjeman called itthatwhen the Battersea Astation was opened in 1934 it was widely acclaimed as a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth centuryWhenin 1939The Architects' Journal conducted a survey to find what were considered the best modern buildings in BritainBattersea was placed second and was the favourite of such unlikely celebrities as Sir Kenneth ClarkRebecca West and Charles LaughtonScott was so pleased with the style he had evolved at Batterseaa treatment that humanised industrial forms without denying their functionthat he also used it on the Guinness Factory at Park Royalwest LondonAt BatterseaScott could not alter the basic design of the building and he much disliked the upturned tableappearance created by the four corner chimneysAt Banksidehoweverhe was able to persuade the engineersMottHay & Andersonto gather all the flues into a single slender tower or campanileAs a resulthe was able to create a symmetricalmonumental composition of great powerAs at all his power stationsScott faced the building in a fine Worcestershire brick that has weathered to a lovely pinky-brownBut there is nothing homely about the general effectVast overlapping planes of brickwork are modelled with careful set-backs and subtle bands of detailThe result is an expression of the monumental aesthetic of the early twentieth centurywith strong American overtonesWhen the campanile is seen from a distanceit seems to belong to some strange Expressionist church one has not noticed beforeNot for nothing were such power stations described as brick cathedralsBankside is the finest manifestation of this traditionNow it is redundantSmoke shimmers no longer from the tall towerBut Bankside is nevertheless a sound structure whichlike the best mills of the Industrial Revolutionis well worth preserving and is perfectly capable of adaptation for a new commercial useSuch re-use isof coursemuch encouraged by a building being listedsomething whichuntil recentlywas not possible with architecture of so recent a dateTwo years agohoweverthe Department of the Environment at last began the listing of post-war buildings in England that were more than 30 years oldBracken Housethe former home of the Financial Timesbecame the first candidate and English Heritage then submitted some 70 recommendations to the Department of the Environmentthese included BanksideThishoweverwas too much for the Government andusing the excuse that public opinion was not yet ready to accept the protection of many unpopular modern buildingsLord Caithnessthe Minister of State for the Environmentarbitrarily whittled down English Heritage's list to 18 buildings excluding Bankside although it represented a more traditional approach in the Fifties to the now-unfashionable Modern MovementHoweverCaithness himself stated that this first selection was in no way a definitive listI have no doubt that others will be addedThe important thing is that the Thirty Year Rule is in force and that we can respond to developing perceptions of our timesEarlier this yearin my capacity as chairman of the Thirties SocietyI asked Caithness's successorVirginia Bottomleyto reconsider English Heritage's recommendation of Bankside for listingMy argument was thatas Michael Heseltine had so boldly listed Battersea Power Station in 1980it was illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architectFurthermorethe listing of Battersea had ensured the building's survival for conversion to a new use in that caseas an entertainment centre which the Prime Minister herself had praised and inauguratedAfter two months' silenceI was informed that ministers stood by their decisionI wrote back asking the reasons for thispointing out thatif any large modern power station deserved to be listedit was BanksideI have received no satisfactory replyOf courseI know perfectly well why the Department of the Environment declines to list itListed building procedures might impede the full commercial realisation of the site when the electricity industry is privatisedFurthermoreBritish Rail has its eyes on the Bankside site for bringing up the spoil from the tunnel for Channel traffic
