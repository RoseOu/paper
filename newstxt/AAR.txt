a complete topPAGEHavelthe young playwright in the late 1960s A writer stillIS CZECHOSLOVAKIA likely to gain a president in Vaclav Havel and lose a dramatistIt seems unlikelyOne of the striking things about Havel is his commitment to drama over the past quarter-century and his insistencein the period immediately before the Czech revolutionthat he was first and foremost a writerI had occasion in late October to present a brief profile of Havel as a preface to a Radio 4 presentation of his latest playRedevelopmentIn the course of it Edward Lucasa BBC Prague correspondentasked Havel directly if he wanted to be presidentHe said that he could not imagine conditions arising that would make it possiblestressed the collective nature of the democratic movement and said I cannot forever play this dual role of amateur politician and writerEarlier this summer he similarly told the Observer's Mark Frankland The more I am forced to be active in politicsthe more I enjoy doing theatreHistory moves fast these daysBut what persuades me that we have not heard the last of Havel the writer is that he combines a total commitment to social freedom and individual responsibility with an extraordinary ironic detachmentIn both his plays and essays recently issued in paperback by Faber under the title Living In Truth he shows a remarkable gift for analysing the dilemmas of the dissident in a repressive societyHe is both participant and observera scepticalsoberanti-Utopianunderstated mindin his own wordsconfronting the business of opposing state power with rueful self-awarenessHavel is now in the seat of powerbut I cannot imagine he has lost his central European gift for ironyAt firstI suspectwe got Havel wrong in this countryon the strength of an early play like The Memorandum 1965we pigeonholed him as an Absurdist along with Beckett and IonescoIn that early workmemorably presented on TV and radiowe see a monolithic state organisation attempting to replace the existing vernacular with a synthetic languagePtydepethat will iron out the ambiguities and imprecisions of everyday speechBut where true Absurdismas Vera Blackwell pointed outposited a meaningless universeHavel's aim was the improvement of man's lot through the improvement of man's institutionsHavel has written constantly about the oppressive nature of Communist bureaucracyBut in recent years his plays have been more about the paradoxical nature of dissidence itselfthe emotional turbulence of the authority given the individual as a public spokesmanand about the fact that one of the worst features of any totalitarian system is the need to conform to other people's expectationsHavel explored the dilemmas of the dissident with wry comedy in The Vanek Plays AudienceProtest and Private Viewwritten in the mid-70sIn the best of themAudienceHavel capitalises on his own experience of working in a brewery at Trutnov stacking empty beer barrelsIn the play we see Vanek a lightly disguised version of Havelsummoned for an interview by the brewery's lager-swilling Head MaltsterHe finds that he is being offered a simple trade-offa comfortable job as a stock-checker if he will provide incriminating information about himself which the Maltster can then pass on to the PartyThe sting lies in the tail when Vanek bends his principles to accommodate his desperate interrogatorWhat Havel wittily shows is the kind of Catch-22 situation faced by a dissident in a despotismwhether to cling fiercely to your own moral integrity thereby landing others in the shitor whether to conform and perpetuate a corrupt systemEVEN after nearly four years in prison wherecharacteristicallyhe turned the permitted weekly letter to his wife into philosophical essaysHavel was able to dramatise the dissident's dilemma with a mixture of recollected pain and resilient humourLargo Desolatowritten in the early 80s is about the difficulty of being a moral hero in an immoral societyHavel's protagonist is a philosopher caught in a double bindHe has offended the state with a work called The Ontology of the Human Self and an openly provocative paper much as Havel himself did with his Open Letter to President Husak of 1975But his simple desire for seclusion is imperilled by a succession of visitorsOn the one handtwo fans from a papermill implore him to become a dissident figureheadon the other handtwo state policmen want him to sign a document denying authorship of the original articleOne sympathises with Havel's predicamentAt the same time the play leaves a key question tantalisingly unresolvedwhetherin a repressive stateone can seek freedom for oneself without seeking it for othersAnd this raises the question of whether Havel's talent had begun to be affected by the nervous strain of writing under surveillance and of not having seen any of his work performed since 1969Any fearshoweverthat Havel's talent might be going off were for me resolved by the broadcast version of Redevelopmentgiven a dramatised reading by the RSC in February under the title Slum ClearanceThis is a major worka densemulti-layered allegory with its roots firmly in realityIt is set in a medieval castle in a historic town in Eastern EuropeSupervised by a state functionary with a sqeaking shoeand led by an emotionally-chaotic project directora group of architects struggle to come up with a high-rise building scheme that will destroy the ancient town's character andincidentallyclear away its slumsOn the realistic levelthe play is about a universal architectural dilemmahow to achieve a balance between conservation and civic improvementBut it also works as a political metaphor about the whimsical arbitrariness of autocracy with the architects first working under strict supervision and then being granted an illusory whiff of freedomThis is vintage Havelcreating a work that is both specific and universaltragic and comicIt leaves me speculating that Havel the artist is unlikely to be displaced by Havel the politicanFor the momenthe obviously has more urgent tasks than writing playsBut he is unlikely to be satisfied forever with the illusion of powerMichael Billington tWhere all

Critic's choice MusicBy Gerald Larner FOLLOWERS of the BBC Philharmonic that small but discriminating section of the concert audience in the North-west will have noticed a peculiarly high proportion of works featuring solo trumpet in the orchestra's current programmesEarlier this month Elgar Howarth conducted the BBC PO in Christopher Sansom's Invisible Cities for trumpet and trombone and orchestrawith Hakan Hardenberger and Christian LindbergIn the RNCM on Friday they are playing Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's Trumpet Concertowith Hakan Hardenberger as soloistIn Studio 7 on January 11 they are playing Michael Blake Watkins's Trumpet Concertoagain with Hakan HardenbergerThe reason behind this concentrated specialist activity is that HardenbergerHowarthand the BBC PO are making a record of the Maxwell Davies and Blake Watkins concertos together with Harrison Birtwistle's Endless Paradewhich last they performed so well and so memorably at York University last seasonFor Hardenberger the brilliant young Swedish trumpeter for whom the Birtwistle and the Blake Watkins pieces were written and who would have commissioned the Maxwell Davies if John Wallace hadn't go there first it is an exciting projectTo me these three pieces are possibly better than anything written for my instrumentWhat anythingI askeddesperately trying to think of great composers who have written great trumpet concertosYesalthough the Haydn can possibly competeThe point is that it has taken players like Wallace and Hardenberger to contradict the cliches about the limitations of the instrument and to prove how flexible it really isIndeedwith what he callls its huge range of expressionas well as its power to fill even the largest concert hallHardenberger feels that the trumpet is a particularly valuable instrument for the contemporary composerHe points to the three British works in the recording project to demonstrate what variety it has to offer the hard black-and-whitesound of the Birtwistlethe comparitively florid flute or clarinet-like writingin the Maxwell Davies Concertothe very expansivetrumpet part in the Blake Watkinswhich is a wonderfully lyrical work without being sweet or silly in any wayHardenberger is particularly happy that his partners in the concerts and in the recording are Elgar Howarth and the BBC PhilharmonicHowartha fellow student of Birtwistle and Maxwell Davies who wrote the Trumpet SonataOp.1for himin Manchester in the 1950sis himself a trumpet player as well as a specialist conductor of contemporary musicHardenberger also recalls that the BBC PO's York performance of Endless Parade a work so difficult in its string scoring that two or three other orchestras have actually refused to play it with him is the best he has taken part in so farI get the impression thatof the threeHardenberger's favourite is the Blake Watkins Concertowhich he considers very Englishmore traditional perhaps but without being in any way limitedThe orchestration is wonderful and there is an absolutely beautiful trumpet partOn the other handhe saysI feel such an enormous amount of emotion in all three piecesIt's not really up to me to judge that they are the best everBut we shall see in 200 years if I am rightTrumpeter as soloistHakam Hardenberghersee Critic's choice THIS CAPTION FOR N-WEST TABLOIDRobert Hands and Tracey Childs in a musical
