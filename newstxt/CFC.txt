catch smugglers following the removal of Euro trade barriersWith goods and people from EC states now able to move freely within the Continentofficers are having to carry out more specialist work to prevent drugs reaching the streetsOfficers spoke of their different style of work following a £4 million seizure of heroin at Harwichand a £4 million haul of amphetamines at Parkeston QuaySteady progress is being maintained and a number of smaller seizures also made at Felixstowe and IpswichPassengers arriving by ferry from Belgium at Felixstowe do not now have to declare goodswhile cargo vessels travelling between EC countries do not have goods cleared by Customs staffCustoms spokesman John Barber said this did not mean the drugs teams were prevented from carrying out their vital workMethods had been changedand officers were now engaged in much more intelligence and research work to identify vessels which were potential carriers and people who might be smugglingWe have been drawing up profiles of potential smugglers so that we know who or what type of people to look for using intelligence sourcesWith cargoes on ships our work is pretty much the same as beforeMost of the source countries for drugs are outside the European community and we would deal with vessels from these places as we have always donehe saidIf officers have reasonable suspicion they can still board

Tory councillors he wants to forge a new partnership between central and local governmentEmpty wordsretorts Colchester Borough Council leader Steve Cawleyparticularly in the wake of the toughest public spending round most authorities can rememberHe spoke to RICHARD WOODARDBRITAIN'S struggle to climb out of the worst recession since the 1930s has seen Ministers return to the old belt-tighteningrhetoric of more than a decade ago a move less than popular with Liberal Democrat Steve CawleyThey've been encouraging local authorities to tighten their belts for the last 14 yearshe protestsIt's not belt-tightening as much as slow strangulationThe premier's talk of working with councils rings rather hollow in Mr Cawley's earsMy idea of a partnership is that it's a two-way thingwith give and takeAt the moment we're doing all the giving and the Government is just takingas if to illustrateHarlow District Council's controversial capping limit has seen their budget more than halvedwith hundreds of redundancies likely to resultAn extreme caseperhapsbut Mr Cawley believes it is nonetheless symptomatic of the financial malaise affecting all authoritiesThis year's budget is far tighter than anything we've had to endure beforehe saysMany councils will be laying off fairly substantially numbers of staff to meet the guidelinesBudgets aren't based on the needs of the local community any morebut dictated by central GovernmentColchester has been protected from the worst effects of the cuts because of forward planninghe saysBut services still sufferand many capital projects including an urgently-needed day centre never get started because the council cannot afford to maintain themThese restrictions are also taking the fire out of budget debatesLast week's meeting of the borough's policy and finance committee was all but devoid of dissenting voicesa mood summed up by one Labour councillor afterwardsWhat's the point of arguingThere's no more money to play with anywayCouncilsargues Mr Cawleyare being hit by an unenviable double whammythanks to the recession and the Government's response to ittighter spending assessments and declining revenue income are adding insult to injurywith ordinary people bearing the bruntThis brings him back to another of Mr Major's weekend promisesto give people more of a stake in their local administrationIf they are going to bring local government closer to peopleit has got to be more responsive to the wishes of peopleand less to the wishes of central GovernmentIf they want us to service local communitieswe must be accountable to themQuite simplythat is no longer the case we are now less accountable to those peopleVote to cut council tax is lostA LAST-DITCH bid to shave £5 off council tax bills was defeated

the resignation of Suffolk Coastal MP John Gummer as Agriculture Minister after his department admitted it did not pay farmers enough compensation for the slaughter of poultry flocks after the 1988 salmonella-in-eggs scareThe United Kingdom Egg Producers' Association said many poultry owners would have been saved from going out of business if the compensation was paid when it was dueIt hit out after a report from the Parliamentary Ombudsman sharply criticised the Ministry of Agriculture over its failure to devise and implement a scheme which complied with the legislationto pay compensationAs a result of the reportmore than 100 farmers are to share in about £600,000 in extra compensation for the compulsory slaughter of their flocksAssociation chairman Andy Oatley saidWe are delighted some members will be paid the sums illegally withheldbut for many it will be too lateThe griefhardship and devastation caused by the slaughter policy was bad enoughThat the ministry should also have cheated egg producers out of their compensation is a matter over which Mr Gummer should resignRichard Northscientific adviser to the egg producerssaid the slaughter programmewhich ended last

where 39 incidents were reportedEach carriageway was badly affectedwith 20 incidents on the clockwise track and 19 anticlockwise during the yearBesides the heavy volume of traffic on the motorway

up-grading the existing A12 south of the county townHoweverat eight milesthe stretch between the M11 and the A12 is also the second-longest section on the M25 without a junction and so is statistically likely to have many delaysThe worst record for a single carriageway last year was an incident count of 23 on the anticlockwise track of the M25 between junctions six and five in KentOverallthe northern and southern halves of the motorway were more or less equalwith 200 incidents in the south between Dartford and junction 15 the M4and 203 in the north between junctions 15 and

of Bosnian life was that the Muslims tended to live in the townswhile the Serbs and the Croats lived in the countrysideConsequentlyin the civil warthe Serbs and the Croats have generally controlled the roads and have been able to cut supplies to the Muslims at willThe town of Cerskanear the Serbian borderhas been methodically shelled by the Serbs for the past year and hasat the same timebeen denied foodThe Serbs did not mind how they disposed of the Muslimsso long as the area was ethnically cleansedThere were two ways in which the outside world might have prevented thisIt might have ordered the Serbs to remove their heavy artilleryby threatening to use counter-forceit might have arranged for the Muslims to move to a safe haven elsewhere in the countryNeither of these were attemptedand now the war is over for the people of CerskaThe Serbs have moved into the townmurdering the inhabitants and pillaging the housesThe outside world talks of a war crimes tribunal but nobody supposes that anything will come of thatJust before the endthe U.S. Air Force tried to drop food supplies to Cerska by airWhether this induced the Serbs to attack at oncewill never be knownPlainly

Ministry of Agriculture has now concluded that there is virtually no problem from salmonella in eggsand what problem there is will not be eased by going around the country slaughtering flocks of hensTrouble began when a mistaken claim by a junior Minister persuaded many people to stop buying eggsAs the sales slumpedthe Government reaction was on the linesWe must do somethingSlaughter is somethinglet's do itIt was a decision taken in hastewhich has been repented at considerable leisureMore than three million hens have been destroyed at a cost of more than £5 million and a number of egg producers have been forced out of business as a resultProducers were put into considerable difficulty by the decision of the Ministry not to pay them full compensationSome farmers were told that they could either settle at once for 60 per cent of what was due to themor wait three years to fight for the full amountThe behaviour of the Ministry was illegal and has been condemned by the Parliamentary ombudsmanJohn Gummerthe Ministerhas apologised and has promised that full restitution will be madeThere have been calls for his resignationwhich he has ignoredIf he is to stay in his jobhe should look more seriously at the many other complaints about the way in which his Ministry is regulating food firmsespecially in the meat tradeMr Gummer is inclined to give a snap reply to his

dismissalA FORMER nurse accused of sexually assaulting residents at a hospital for the mentally handicapped has lost his claim for unfair dismissalBy a two-to-one majority an industrial tribunal yesterday ruled that New Possibilities NHS Trust had acted correctly in sacking Noel Reid from his post at Turner Village Hospital last yearThe split decisionarrived at after almost two hours deliberation by the panelreflected the complexity of the two-day hearing during which shocking allegations were made about what life was like for residents in the Colchester hospitalThe tribunal in Bury St Edmunds was told that Mr Reidalong with other nursing staff on the hospital's now-closed villa tendrank while on dutygroped residents and encouraged them to sexually assault one anotherMr

complaints to management about their own conductBoth are on final written warningsResponsibleRico Gopula staff nurse in the villa at the time of the alleged incidentstold the tribunal he had been accused of the same offences as Mr Reid but had received only a written warningHe too denied the chargesDirector of specialist support for New Possibilities Fay Gerrie said she took the original decision to sack Mr Reidwho has 28 years' service at the hospitalbecause he was the charge nurse and therefore responsible for the villaProcedures at the NHS trust were criticised during the hearing with tribunal chairman Richard Smith questioning why formal notes were not taken during disciplinary hearingsMr Reid maintains he was refused the right to call witnesses on his behalf while Mrs Gerrie said she could not remember a request being made at the original hearingAfter the tribunaldirector of personnel for New Possibilities Andrew Arnold said there were lessons to be learned and not only would proper records now be kept of disciplinary hearings but a new whistle-blowingpolicy was being introduced to make it easier for staff to expose wrong-doingCounsel for Mr ReidPhilip Alikersaid he

airport's potential importance for job creation and economic prosperity in the Ipswich areaImprovements to facilities will be encouragedThis is an excerpt from the Labour-controlled borough council's Draft Local Plan in 1984The statement is true todayexcept that the potential importance is enormously increased by the EC free marketSo why did all 27 Labour councillors vote on January 6 to close itSuch a reversal of views to a position so obviously against the wishes of the people cannot be genuineand requires some explanationVarious alternative uses have been suggested by the council in its attempts to justify the closurebut its main plank has been the need for housingHoweverall the forecasts of housing need have been overtaken by the release of thousands of houses in Ipswich and district resulting from the departure of American familiesIt is therefore unlikely that the need for housing at the airport will arise for decadesOne might have expected that at least some of the Labour members would welcome this opportunity to save the airport entrusted to thembut it appears that the ordinary members are unable to use their right to vote in accordance with their wisheshowever strongly heldThe electors will not forgetI have long held the view that there is a small clique whose real objective has been to close the airport regardless of any other consideration it would be

financial arrangementsWe have now carried out a very careful appraisal and taken staff views into considerationThe ultimate decision will be made by parents and we look forward to hearing what they have to sayAwkwardHead teacher Dr Aline Black said the governors were right to consider seeking the views of parentssince the situation had changed dramatically in the past yearBy Septemberthe school would be in the awkward position of being the only selective school in Essex not to be GM and it would be one of very few secondary schools generally in north-east Essex not to have opted outshe saidGovernors were now in a better position to judge how recently opted out schools have fared financiallyshe saidWhile there is no crock of gold for GM schoolsat least one is starting to see more clearly the financial implications and able to weigh them up against money coming into the schoolDr Black stressedhoweverthat she wished to work within whatever framework the governors and parents

criticisedAN ESSEX MEP has accused civil servants of wasting public money by visiting car boot sales and arresting people selling alcohol brought from EuropeAnne McIntoshMEP for north east Essexhas been campaigning against UK rates of excise duty whichshe saysare making people buy drink on the Continent rather than at British shopsShe saidI am very concerned that a number of HM Customs and Excise staff are now employed in arresting those making illegal sales of winebeer and other personal imports at car boot sales at weekendsSurely this cannot be justified as an effective use of civil servants' time or public moneyCustoms' spokesman John Barber said that excise verification teams in East Anglia had been investigating people who brought goods back from the Continent and sold themIn addition to car boot salesofficers had visited shops selling tobacco and drinkHe thought that Miss McIntosh's accusations were unfairWe only work to the laws which are enforced and are made by ParliamentMr Barber saidIn the East Anglian Customs and Excise region there have been no arrests in relation to these imports but there have been some seizures of alcohol at boot sales in Norfolk and SuffolkThere had been 36 seizures nationally in January and he thought the number of arrests could be counted on the fingers of one handMiss McIntosh said that many businesses in Britain had suffered because of cheap drink from EC countriesIf wine merchants and restaurants are to survive and jobs are to be preservedUK rates of excise duty on alcohol must be brought into line with those of other

political honours and that provoked an angry reaction from LabourOpposition leader John Smith called it a shoddy misuseof the systemBut the first shake-up since the First World War does mean a deep-seated reform in the principle behind the choice of names in the Birthday and New Year Honours listsIn future the accent will be on voluntary serviceand unsungworthy people up and down the country beavering away on charitable workIt will be up to ordinary people as shareholdersin the system to winkle out these deserving cases who would otherwise pass unnoticedDowning Street will supply them with special forms to state the reasons for their recommendationsNo longer even can ambassadors assume that a knighthood will come along automaticallySenior law officerslike the Attorney Generalmay have to remain plain misterMr Major told MPs that the awarding of honours had been a valued part of British life for centuries but the system must from time to time be reviewedHonours should be awarded on merit for exceptional achievement or exceptional serviceover and above what normally might be expectedThere should be different levels of award to reflect different levels of achievementAwards should not be automatic and follow simply as a result of doing a particular jobAwards should place more emphasis on voluntary serviceThe overhaul of the system includes abolishing the British Empire Medalwidely regarded as the gong for the working classesIn futurethose who would have received it will be made Members of the British Empireseen as a white-collar awardAnd the

Burroughes and David CarterTHE GLOOMY jobs market will stay sluggish for some time after the recession endsEssex Tory MPs warned at the weekendThere will be little change in the employment situationdespite signs that the cold economic climate is thawingsaid the MPs as they set out their Budget hopesMeanwhilethe Tory Party is counting on the bitter disputes over Europe being set aside when Chancellor Norman Lamont presents what may be his last Budget tomorrowManpowerA national survey and comments from MPs suggest little immediate relief for the country's joblesswith unemployment now at three millionColchester North MP Bernard Jenkin and Saffron Walden's Alan Haselhurst echoed the findings of a survey by employment services company ManpowerIt shows that Essexgrouped as part of the Home countieswill see job prospects changing little for the second quarter of 1993Although 17 per cent of employers believe there will be an upturn in vacancies18 per cent fear a dropMr Jenkin saidA fall in the jobless total will be one of the last indications that the recession is coming to an endCompanies are likely to continue to be laying off surplus staff well into the recoveryas was the case during the last recession in the early '80sI'm afraid it will be bleak for some timeMr Jenkin said he believed the Chancellor should cut the huge deficitand he predicted this could mean increases in indirect taxationMr Haselhurst saidI think on all the previous evidence the last thing that will happen now will be a fall in unemploymentIn the recession of the early 1980s it took four years for the unemployment figures to dropHe said any measures to tackle the budget deficit should be secondary to dealing with the recessionUnityTom Kennyof Manpowersaid yesterday the only regions showing a rise in job prospects were Scotland and north Walesalong with parts of the North-WestThe results for Essex show no sign of increased optimism over job prospects in the region over the past yearhe saidIn Suffolka Tory MP called on Mr Lamont to present a Budget which would allow the party to uniteWaveney member David Porter saidWe don't need to divide ourselves over Maastricht and other European mattersThis has got to be a Budget for jobsEmployment mustof coursebe one of the highest prioritiesIt is going to be quite a fine balance between the need to cut spendingcutting taxation and not killing off the tender recoveryhe saidLabour stalwart diesaged 78LORD Underhillone of the stalwarts of the Labour Party over the past 30 yearshas died aged 78The party's former national agentwho lived at Buckhurst Hill in Essexdied on Friday night at St Margaret's Hospital in EppingAs Reg Underhillhe carried out the key role of national agent for Labour from 1972 to 1979On retiring from the post he became a life peer and was appointed deputy leader of the Labour Party in the Lords in 1982an office he relinquished only two years agoHe concentrated in the Lords on local government and transport issuesHe remained an active figure in the House until only a week agoMany believe that if Labour's national executive had acted on his report in the mid-1970s about the need to root out Militant Tendencythe party would have been saved the turmoil of the 1980sby which time Militant had gained a gripLord Underhill was regarded as one of the most knowledgeable people about the internal workings of the Labour PartyHe was also a former president of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities andas his chosen title Lord Underhill of Leyton indicatedwas a life-long supporter of Leyton Orient FCHe leaves a widowFloraa son and two daughtersLord GrahamLabour chief whip in the Lordssaid at the weekendEven though he came to the Lords with no experience of the House of Commonshe immediately got into the swing of it and was quickly given authority by his colleaguesHe soon showed that he was a canny politician and he will be sorely missedLAMONT'S CHALLENGESNORMAN Lamont will tomorrow try to revive confidence in the Government as a whole and in his management of the economy in particularHe needs to persuade foreigners that it is safe for them to lend the best part of £1000 million a week to the Treasuryand he needs to persuade Britons that it is safe for them to start spending their money againHe starts with the disadvantage of having been wrong in the pastA year ago he promised his creditors that the pound sterling would never be devaluedand six months ago he had to break his word to themA year ago he was promising economic growth in the UKwhich should by now have been accelerating to three per cent per year butof courseit never happenedThis year the Chancellor has been insisting that the pound cannot be allowed to go any lowerbecause of the dangers of inflationand he has allowed the Bank of England to give a strong endorsement of his argumentNobody is yet convinced that he really would be willing to raise interest rates if there were a prolonged run on the pound sometime this yearAt homewhile Ministers are careful not to use such words as green shootsin publicthey use them off the record all the time to political journalistswho dutifully pass the message on to the reading publicNeverthelessthe opinion polls which test public confidence in the future of the economy are showing a substantial majority on the side of gloomif not doomThere are positive signsthere is more money in circulation and some of it is being spentThe market for houses and cars is better than it wasand there is an improved turnover in the shopsYet there does not seem to be any end to the announcements of redundancies in major companieswhich make the headlines and arouse general anxiety elsewhereThe classic response to this situation is to take from the rich and to give to the poor on the grounds that the poor spend their money much faster than the richThe circulation of money is thereby improvedcreating more economic activity and more jobs and all this without printing money which would lead to inflationAfter bullying the Queen into paying income tax like everybody elsethe Government has been embarrassingly reminded by the Birt affair of the many high earners who do not by any means pay tax like everybody elseMr Lamont will be expected to respond by making a serious attempt to plug tax loopholes before he talks of increases in general taxationHe will also be expected to end the anomaly whereby high earners are excused national insurance contributions on earnings of over £21,000 a yearThat would give him a chance to reduce tax on lower incomeswhich are so discouraging to people caught in the poverty trapAn adjustment of this kind would serve to promote recoveryand it should also go some way to reassure international opinionBankers like to see governments breaking their election promises because this proves that they are in earnest in their attempts to put the economy to rightsThe budget needs to be a holding operationso that a recovery can become established before the real attack on the budget deficit is made in DecemberIts success will depend upon people believing that Mr Lamont knows what he was doingand that his

nominees wanting to represent HarwichBut when the new meeting took placethose members present refused to select a candidate until Mr Knight was put back in contentionThis meant he had to go back to the county party and ask to be put back on their panel of candidatesa request which was turned down on SaturdayCounty party chairman Kees Maxey said he could not give the reasons why Mr Knight was

that surrounded the basethe paper saidThe landing is supposed to have happened on December 271980Ralph Noyesa former top civil servant said to have responsibility for UFO sightingsis to tell a TV station that the MoD imposed a news black-out about the landingMr Noyes will claim the MoD said nothing about the alleged landing because it wanted to save any embarrassmentBut a spokesman for the MoD

million of stolen cash instead used an Essex caravan site as a hide-outPhil Wells48vanished from Heathrow Airport following the theft of the money in 1989 and was believed to be living somewhere in Floridaor possibly deadHowevera man claiming to be Wells contacted a national newspaper last week and told a journalist he was forced to steal the money by gangsters and never left the countryThe manpictured in yesterday's Sunday Mirror wearing a thick black false beardalso claims he was paid only a few thousand pounds from the massive haul and is now brokeHe told the reporterwho was driven blindfold to meet him at a secret locationthat gangsters doused one of his two sons with petrol and threatened to kill them both if he did not co-operate in the theftFar from living the high life in Floridahe said the first six weeks after the raid were spent at an unidentified caravan site in ClactonDuring that time he was ordered by gang members to shave off his beard to change his appearance and was again threatened that his family would be harmed if he did not do as he was toldThe man claims he was then taken to a boat on the Norfolk Broadswhere he lived for two weeksand then spent a week holed-up in a room at an unknown holiday campHe told the reporter that he later lived for two years on a barge near Shrewsburyduring which time he suffered a stroke but refused to go to hospitalAccording to yesterday's reportthe man has decided to come forward because the gang has told him they are ending his regular cash paymentswhich he used to collect in LondonHe says he is now

Steward of Cross Green FarmCockfield is unhappy about people objecting to Atlas Aggregates proposal to excavate sand and gravel from his landas he has a vested interest in the project being approvedThe suggestion that the opposition to the scheme is confined to a few people is rather misleadingas packed village meetings in Stanningfield and Lavenhamwhich voted to oppose the applicationbear witnessNo doubt the same will happen in Cockfield itself this FridayI am also given to understand that the decision on the fate of the application is going to have to be delayed until May due to the very large number of objections received by Suffolk County CouncilMr Steward may feel that the project is low keybut when a nine acre sand and gravel pit is proposed to be worked for four years only a matter of 45 metres from the nearest residence and 280 metres from the centre of Cross Green Atlas Aggregate's figuresthe residents of Cockfield are entitled to feel differentlyNobody is denying that Mr Steward has attempted to landscape and improve aspects of his farmThe tragedy of the situation is that if the application succeedsit will destroy the wildlife safe havenhe has createdas the existing lakes will be used as settling basins for the millions of gallons of water and sediment to be pumped from the proposed gravel pitThe residents of Cockfield are contesting the application on technical grounds of the impact on health and safetyand the effects on the environmentWe are also gravely concerned because at the Lavenham parish meeting Mr Tony Webster of Atlas Aggregates categorically refused to give an assurance that in the future they would not apply to extend the mining operation to other parts of Cross Green FarmAll things considered the

impasse sent Hong Kong stocks plummeting and the colony's main stock index closed 5.1 per cent lowerThe plan is designed to create disorder and to impede the smooth transfer of powerso it is not a question of democracyLi said in his annual work report at the opening session of Congress in PekingHis monotone reading of the two-hour work report switched to an angryharanguing tone when he came to the section denouncing BritainLi Peng's sharp criticism of the political reform package he called it perfidiouswas greeted by loud applause from the 3,000 delegatesWe're simply disappointed to see this kind of attack turn up in Li Peng's work reportBritish Embassy spokeswoman Janet Rogan said after the speechThe Hang Seng Index closed 315.29 points down at 5,854 after a day of sharp fluctuations but with Hong Kong's brokers cautiously optimistic of a swift recoveryProbe into Kray's phone line messagePRISON staff are carrying out a full investigation after it was revealed that

£30,000£1.87 on married couples' allowances£1.03 on VAT on fuel43p on single per-son's income tax23p on vehicle excise duty and 63p on excise dutiesThis adds up to a loss of £9.57But when taken in conjunction with other Budget measures which could benefit the familyLabour has estimated the loss at a rounded down figure of £8Mr Brown said Mr Major told the Commons in January last year we have no plans to increase VATthere will be no VAT increaseHe said Mr Lamont declared in last year's Budget he had no needno proposals and no plans either to raise or to extend the scope of VATMr Brown saidThe result of this Budget is that taxes on petrolcigarettes and alcohol are upnational insurance and VAT are to risemortgage tax relief has been cutWe will be campaigning throughout the country on the

of a steadyif unspectaculargrowth in retail sales over the past few monthsShould Alan Ingram's verdict on the Budget be widely heldMr Lamont would do well to prepare himself for that growth to stop

looks as if we are going to be quite a bit worse off next yearhe saidI may have been thinking of using the money saved from the mortgage payments on a new telly or somethingbut not nowA combination of higher fuel billsincreased National Insurance payments and bigger mortgage repayments next year because of the drop in interest relief makes 1994 a gloomy prospect for the IngramsMr Ingram drives a

Norman Lamont delivered what one CBI official called a knife-edgeBudget yesterday to balance the nation's books without stifling economic recoveryChancellor plays it safePolitical correspondent David Weisbloom reviews his speechYESTERDAY'S Budget was surprising for one reason only it contained no surprisesHad Norman Lamont been making his speech to the Commons 100 years agohe would have worn a hat and commentators would have expected a rabbit to have been produced from itLast yearin a symbolic gesturehe introduced a 20p tax bandThe year beforehe slashed poll tax bills by £140 a head by raising VAT to 17.5 per centIt was reasonable to assume thatthis time around he would stun the outside world with a similar manoeuvrebut this was not to beWhen the media speculates about Government intentionsthey are usually proved right with the exception of the Chancellor's Budget pronouncementsIn the run-up to Budget daynewspapers are invariably full of so-called informed comment from well-placed sourcesThis year was no exceptionwith one important differenceThese well-placed sources for once proved their worthAs expectedMr Lamont extended the VAT base and the 20p bandleft the basic and higher tax rates untouchedfroze thresholdscut mortgage interest reliefover-indexed duty on cigarettesbeerwine and petroland made a modest effort to tackle Britain's rising unemploymentAlmost as predictablyhe plumped for a 1pc increase in National Insurance contributionsThoughas a consequencefrom 1994 most of us will be paying an extra penny in tax on our incomebelow the National Insurance ceilingTory MPs will be relieved the basic rate has been left at 25p and the 20p band extendedPerhaps because in future we will have a unified Budgetwith tax and spending announcements made at the same timeMr Lamont chose to look further ahead than the 1993–94 financial yearMore importantlyhe must have also felt thatwith a public sector borrowing requirement approaching £50 billionthe markets needed pacifying immediatelyThat is why he gave the City prior notice of measures that will come into effect in April1994It is clear thatdespite the clamour for his resignationMr Lamont is hoping to

just before his departureand went away happywith its runningHoweverhe said they only asked about staffing contracts between Ling and the health authoritywhich were all above boardThe problem exists in the way people used or did not obey the contracts between usargued Mr ThomsonHe also agreed that many hands-offorganisations across the country experienced the same problemsand there was some doubt about the precise legal positionBut he maintained that the trust had to be seen to be separate from the health authorityMr Thomson also felt undermined because untoward occurrencesincluding allegations of staff threatening residentswere not being relayed to him for up to three weekseven though he was legally responsible for reporting them to the county councilMr Arnold questioned why he had not tried harder to set up a system for receiving such information more swiftlyEverything I tried was blockedcomplained Mr ThomsonEarlier Mr Thomson told the tribunal of his last days in the jobHe

link is approvedTHE £3 billion Channel Tunnel high-speed rail link and the £300 million Heathrow Express line are to go aheadChancellor Norman Lamont announced yesterday.But the future of the £1.7 billion cross-London rail link Crossrail appeared less certain with Mr Lamont saying the scheme was now going to be a joint venture between the public and private sectors.The much-delayed 68-mile Channel Tunnel fast link will not go into London's King's Cross station as British Rail hopedbut instead will terminate at neighbouring St Pancras a less expensive option.But Mr Lamont did say that Government money would be put into the scheme which could be completed by the end of the decade.The 15-mile Paddington-Heathrow fast link a joint venture between BR and airport operator BAA will be started later this year and should be finished by the second half of 1997The start of the London Underground-BR Crossrail schemescheduled originally for 1995could now be put back following the decision to involve the private sector.Likely to take five years to completethe scheme would run from Reading and Aylesbury in the west across London to Shenfield in Essex in the eastIt is designed to

attackers to lick her own bloodEVIDENCE is emerging that thousands of women have been systematically and brutally raped in the conflict in former YugoslaviaCHARLOTTE ADCOCK spoke to a woman who has interviewed some of the victimsReaders may find parts of this account upsettingR ape in warfare has often been overlookedWidely considered a routineif regrettablefact of warit has rarely been prosecutedReports on the armed conflict in the former Yugoslaviahoweversuggest not only that rape and the sexual abuse of women have been carried out on a massive scalebut that it has been systematic and organisedEvidence is now emerging that women have been detained in order to be raped and even impregnatedand that political and military leaders knewbut condoned it.One woman who can testify to the existence of rape camps and the suffering of womenis Francoise Hampsonsenior lecturer at Essex University and an expert in the law of armed conflictShe has just returned from interviewing rape victims in Bosnia during a nine-day mission led by the International League of Human Rights.While European Community officials estimate 20,000 women have been rapedFrancoise Hampson says quantification is impossibleThe only value in the figures is the indication of the scale and an adjective would be betterThe word I would pick is widespreadHuman rights organisations remain wary of publishing figures because they have been widely used as propagandaAmnesty International hashoweverreleased details of individual accounts to illustrate at least part of what has occurredThe accounts include those of Moslems from KljucOne mother described how her daughter was locked up and she was raped by three drunkuniformed men whom she knewAnother woman in her mid-sixties said she had been one of eight raped by Serbian irregularsThree of them raped herone first forced his hand into her at knifepoint and then made her lick her own bloodTwo of the women had their throats slit after the rapesthe report states.Victims have been assaulted in different situationssaid Ms HampsonWomen have been randomly raped by individualsgang-raped by uniformed menand raped in detention centres either by the guards or people let in by the guardsThere has also been a high incidence of murder following rape.Allegations have to be handled with carebut there is clear evidence that rape camps have been set upI interviewed someone from a rape camp in DobojIt was unequivocally a place where women were held in order to be rapedshe said.Observers have also identified a specific category of women raped in order to be made pregnantRape has happened on all sides and across the sexesbut according to Ms Hampson the overwhelming majority of the rape victims are non-SerbsSeveral factors have made the abuse particularly cruel and degradingThe fact that it's so systematicgoing effectively unpunished and often performed by people known to the victims makes it more horrificIt's been made even more humiliating by the circumstances in which it's been done like public rapeIn no case where we interviewed had the woman only been raped by one manPlenty of them had only been raped over one period of 24 hours but never less than by six or seven menTwo women passed out when raped by number three so they don't knowThe effect on womenin a Moslem culture which perhaps considers rape more dishonourable than murderhas been profoundVictims have been openly accused by their husbands of being Chetnik whoresSome have been abandoned by their families and others forced to leaveThere isn't even guaranteed support from other women because it's seen as so shamefulSome haven't told their mothersThey believe they know and look at them differentlyand it's avoided as a topic of conversationResources are scarcemedical treatment limited and abortions not always availableMany victims are also having to come to terms with the trauma while looking after children and the elderly in overcrowded refugee camps.Whether rape has been singled out by military commanders as a weapon of war remains open to questionbut victims' testimony suggests the abuse is part of a wider pattern of warfare and ethnic cleansingMs Hampson believes the abuse is more than an incidental or sexual actIt is clearly being used as an instrument to achieve a military purposePeople aren't raping for rape's sakeIn some instances where villages are being cleansedrape is being used to terrorize and humiliate communitiesThere is evidence that raperegarded as good for moraleincreased after a military setback and that peer group pressure is strongClearly the authorities know the rape camps are there and what they're being used forA lot of people who haven't previously raped must be going around rapingShe admits in the final analysis she finds it difficult to make sense of the gratuitous savageryI'm left with extremely uncomfortable questions about what makes men tick and I don't see any reason to believe that men in the former Yugoslavia are different from men elsewhereThat doesn't mean I think all men are rapists butit means a significant proportion of the men around us in that situation of social breakdown would rape and I can't even begin to digest that notionWhat she is clear about is that rape is a war crime and ought to be prosecutedRape clearly contravenes international law and she cites the 1907 Hague Conventionsthe '49 Geneva Conventions and the '77 Protocols to make her pointIt is not new laws that are required but enforcement of existing onesshe says.The International League is now calling for effective individual accountability for serious violations of the law and the creation of a war crimes tribunalReconciliation requires a coming to terms with the past not its burial or

the fort following a major burglary two years agoThe latest attacked happened on Monday night at about 6 pm when a thorough search was made of the fortIt has obviously set back our restoration workMr Rutter saidbut the worst aspect is the effect it will have on the morale of volunteersThey feel they are wasting their time because their hard work is getting smashed upIt will take a fair amount of skill and cajoling to pick up the piecesMr Rutter addedI cannot understand why anybody would burgle The Redoubt because ever since our last burglary there has not been anything of value kept

301992Witness tells court soldiers faked injuryTHE only civilian witness to the events surrounding the deaths of two teenage joyriders in Northern Ireland claimed yesterday he saw one soldier attack anotherSix soldiers are on trial at Belfast Crown Court facing charges following the shooting in September 1990 at the Upper Glen Road in West BelfastOne of the six denies the murder of Karen Reilly18who was a passenger in the stolen Astra carThe driverMartin Peake17also diedAll six soldiers deny attempting to pervert public justice and obstructing investigationsThe prosecution alleges thatto justify the shootingthe soldiers said they opened fire on a stolen car after it had struck one of their patrolTo back the claim up one soldier was assaulted to make it appear he had been hit by the carThe witness said he was in his caravan at an itinerant site on the Upper Glen Road when he was woken by the sound of gunfireI saw one soldier standing in the roadI saw another soldier standing behind himI then saw the other soldier standing behind him either going to hitor hitting him with a rifle on the leghe told the courtThe man said he later went outside and saw a soldier lying on the road with others around him who seemed to be helping him or attending to himHe stayed outside for a while before being ordered back inside his caravan by the soldiersBitternessUnder cross-examination he denied his evidence was tainted by any bitterness he held for British soldiers because he had been jailed in 1968 for five years in Manchester for assaultBut the man said he believed the shooting of the teenagers was wrongand that by the morning after the shooting he realised the relevance of what he had witnessedWhen pressed by the defence on how he could see what was happening in the dark the man repliedI was reared without lightsI'm used to the darkBut he admitted he could not be sure he saw a soldier make contact with another soldier with his rifleThe only policeman on patrol with the soldiers claimed he witnessed the attack and that the stolen car had not hit any member of the patrol and that the shooting had been totally unjustifiedA doctor who examined the soldier who claimed he had been hit by the car said he found a bruise measuring 10cms on his left thighLimpingHe said the soldier told him he had been struck a glancing blow by the carbut that he had not been knocked over and afterwards had been able to continue on dutyThe doctor said the injury could have been caused in a number of ways and though the soldier was limping he was surprised that such a minor injury would cause a limpThe trial was adjourned until todayJail for welder who killed burglarA WELDER was jailed for nine months yesterday for accidentally killing a man he believed had burgled and

clever they were to have been able to cut taxation and to increase public spending at one and the same timeYesterdayNorman Lamont presented the bill for that clevernesswith a demand for more than £10,000 million a year in extra taxation from 1995/6 onwardsIt is a large sumand yet it may not be enoughIt will certainly not allow the Chancellor to meet the target that he set himself last year of a balanced budget in the medium termIn the coming yearhe expects to borrow £50,000 millionand he hopes to reduce that to around £20,000 million over four yearsApart from raising taxesthe Government hopes to be able to curb its spending programmesand a review is already under wayNo resultshoweverare expected for some timeand in any caseWhitehall expenditure reviews are notorious for failing to deliver anything of significanceThere isthereforea strong reliance upon economic growth to yield higher tax revenues and a lower social security budgetMr Lamont forecasts that the economy will be growing at the rate of three per cent per year in 12 months' timehe would have carried more convictionif he had not made the same jam tomorrowforecast a year agoMany of his proposals are intended to help British industry and in themselves these are welcomeIn Suffolkwe are particularly glad that Customs and Excise has at last been persuaded that horse-racing is an industry not a hobbyand that it will adjust its VAT demands accordinglyYet in racingin export credit guarantees and elsewherethe Chancellor was reacting late in the day to complaints that had been clearly audible for some considerable timeHe should have been doing this a year or two agoin the hope that extra jobs would have been created before nowAs it isit will be much harder to persuade employers to expandnow that they can see the storm clouds of swingeing tax increases ahead of themEven in the short termthey can see a dismally weak market in the rest of Europeand no obvious sign that the British public has the confidence to start spending againThis last is the main disappointment of the budgetThe bad news for the average householder is written largewhile the good news is in small printThe net result may be neutral as Mr Lamont claimsbut it does not look that way to the casual viewer who may as a result end the day in a gloomier mood than he beganFor exampleMr Lamont referred to the unemployedexpressing his deepest sympathy for themand promising to do something to helpHaving raised expectationshe went on to limit that help to just 100,000 peopleand of those 100,00060,000 were offered no more than the chance to work on a community scheme for next to nothingThere are times when Chancellors are right to fuss with mini-measuresand there are times when they need to make an instant impactMr Lamont should have concentrated on doing his own job wellinstead of making a series of announcements on behalf of the Departments of TransportHealthSocial Security and Industryall of which have articulate Ministers of their ownHis impact at home was weakand it has to be hoped that his impact abroad was rather betterOn the figures he gaveit is an open question whether foreign bankers will want to finance the continuing borrowing requirement at existing interest rates and at the existing parity of sterlingThe financial situation of the country is such that no budgetary proposals could have been guaranteed to rescue itWhile appreciating the extraordinary difficulties facing Mr Lamontit must still be said that he could have handled them better than this
