DeparturesCautionary tale for enterprising readersBy PETER DUNNPERHAPS the Independent Traveller ought to carry some sort of warningReading this section can change your lifeIt certainly did for Simon Turnerwho read a feature on these pages a year ago written by Godfrey Hodgson on his travels around the Michelin Red Rockerhotels in the region around Toulouse in south-west FranceMr Turner was a chartered surveyor who worked for Hamptons estate agentsbut had realised that he patently wasn't suited to selling housesHe confesses that at the age of 40 he had reached the proverbial midlife crisisand was searching for a different way of lifeI had holidayed several times in France and was toying with the idea of buying a house therebut with no definite plan in mindI had already received details of properties in several regions of Franceincluding the Toulouse areawhen I providentially read your articleAt the sign of the Red Rockerthe catalyst being the mention of a cheap flight to Toulouse from Heathrow for £116 returnHe immediately booked a flight to Toulousesaw a house 35 miles north-west of Toulouse in a small hamlet and realised it was ideal as a home as well as an aubergeI discussed the matter with my wife and signed a contract straight awaywithout my wife seeing the houseI then left Hamptons and spent two months at the Berlitz School of Language in LondonMr Turner his wife and three daughters aged eightsix and four moved to France in April and his auberge opened in JulyThe three children are now attending the local village schoolDespite various teething problems we are very happy in our new lifesaid Mr TurnerThe auberge is an attractive nineteenth-century house standing in a secluded garden of about one acre with glorious views towards the PyreneesGuests have the use of the spacious ground-floor living room with direct access to the large south-facing terraceThere are also swings and a games room for the childrenThere are three rooms availableone doubleone

Normandy last monthAfter a meal for four at Les Quatre Saisons restauranthe was presented with a bill for Fr 1,887around £180When he later took the trouble to add up the bill he discovered that the actual cost was Fr 1,481around £140an overcharge of £40He recovered this money the following dayHow many people take the trouble to check their hotel or restaurant bills these daysPerhaps there are

absoluteAlison Lurie followed FlaubertColette and Sarah Bernhardt to find drama and mythology on Belle-Ileoff the coast of BrittanyBy ALISON LURIEAt the siege of Belle-Isle I was there all the whileAll the whileall the whileAt the siege of Belle-Isle Until last month these lines were only a nursery-rhyme to meaccompanied in my memory by a crude illustration of a tower by the sea and square-rigged warship balancing on humped wavesI thought of the place as an imaginary islanda sort of French Never Never LandBut there is a real Belle-Ile in the Atlantic about eight miles off the coast of southern Brittanya mysteriousbeautifulisolated island shaped like a fish swimming north-westedged with black cliffs and coves of pale-brown sugar-sandJust off its shore stand giant rocks carved into strange jagged patterns by the seaThe place has always attracted writers and artists and lovers of strange and dramatic sceneryColette went there at 21While her unpleasant husband shut himself in his room and wrote lettersshe explored the island with Paul Masson and for the first time in her life tasted and touched the saltthe sandthe seaweedthe odorous soft bed of the receding seathe dripping fishThe sea-gravel seemed to her to be composed of shattered rubies tinted with mauveFlaubert describes Belle-Ile at length in Par les Champs et par les GrevesCourbetMonetand Matisse lived and painted thereLaterAndre BretonSalvador Daliand other surrealists stayed and worked in a now-destroyed hotel on its wild western shorethe famed Cote SauvageI reached Belle-Ile by ferry from the peninsula of Quiberonafter a seven-hour drive in 27-degree heat from the Paris airport that nothing on earth would induce me to repeat though my two companionsone British and one Frenchconversed enthusiastically on operaEuropean politicsand structural anthropologyA better alternative might be to travel by rail or plane to L'Orient30 miles westand rent a carAs a result of the journeyhoweverI can report that French motorway food is greatly superior to AmericanWe were offered fresh do-it-yourself saladsgood local cheesesstrawberry tart and chocolate mousseThe souvenirs on salethoughwere of

island against invadersThe citadel's roughsheer pale-brown outer walls and ramparts resemble a giant sandcastle built on the edge of the seaIt is now a museum of military historybut was once full of armed men and artilleryThe siege commemorated in my nursery rhyme took place in 1761an English fleet cut off supplies to the citadeland after 38 days the garrison surrenderedUntil about 20 years ago

runs from Quiberon to the little fishing port of Sauzonwhich is almost postcard-pretty from a distance but given satisfying reality in close-up by the sounds and smells of its trade and the stacks of water-roughened lobster traps and water-soaked nets and floatsOn the jetty near the little lighthouse is a remarkably good restaurantWe sat on its terrace overlooking the harbourwatching the sky blush rose-red and devouring plum oysterscrabsand langoustines caught that same day and the first snails I have ever had that did not taste like bits of black rubber boot fried in garlic and olive oilThe Atlantic coast of Belle-Ile is known as the Cote Sauvageand in most places is sufficiently savage to deter any invaderIn the nineteenth century the actress Sarah Bernhardtattracted by the Absoluteas one guidebook puts itbuilt a chateau high on the cliff near its northernmost endthe Pointe des Poulains Foals' Pointwhere the offshore rocks are said to resemble young horses galloping in the swaying navy-blue seaHer house is in ruins nowcovered with flowering weeds and inhabited only by seagullsWhile we were on the beach below another tourist tried to climb up to the ruinbut a flock of dive-bombing gullsscreaming histrionicallydrove him offhree kilometres south of the Point des Poulains is a spectacular sea-level cavethe Grotte de l'ApothicairerieIts name comes from the cormorants' nests which in the past were ranged in rows along shelves in the wet black rocklike jars in a chemist's shopNow only the sea thunders rhythmically through the grottoflinging up fans of salty sprayFurther along the coast is the most amazing sight of allthe Aiguilles needlesde Port-Cotona chain of hugespiky dark rocks that emerge from the sea like the petrified remains of some prehistoric monsterThe waves around these rocks churn up a salty froth that is said to resemble cotton-woolthough to me it seemed more like the foaming spit of an angry sea-serpentAfter touring the Cote Sauvage we had a perfect lunch in a crep eriegalettes whole-wheat crepes made from sarazin black wheatfilled with ham or melted cheese and accompanied by foaming mugs of Breton ciderthen crisp lacy brown crepes with sugar and jam or chocolate saucewhich bore no resemblance to the limp pancakes served under that name in AmericaAs the afternoon temperature rose our thoughts turned to the beachesThere are many on the quieter north shore or Cote du Dedansall beautiful and uncrowdedThe best-known is Les Grands Sablesover a mile long and backed by cliffs where the gorse-bushes were explosions of butter-yellow fireworksOn the Cote Sauvage is Port-Donantwhere the surf is exciting and sometimes dangerousIt is popular with summer bathersbut at other times the water is cold and the fine sand dotted with jellyfish like complicated hot-weather dishessemi-transparent yellow-streaked boeuf en daube and deep magenta grape aspicThe central part of the island seemed at first to belong to another and less dramatic worldWe passed gently rolling pastures where fat sheep and cows grazedempty dusty roads edged with white convolvulus and daisiesand fields of grain rippling in the soft wind like beige velvet stroked by an invisible handBut even here there were signs that we were not far from the sea or from strange phenomenaThe cypress es on the heights had grey wind-contorted branches and trunksmimicking the twisted layers of rock by the oceanand at a distance the whitewashed farmhouseswith their triangular gable endslooked like fleets of sailboats moored beyond the farthest fieldStanding in the fields in the centre of the island were two tall stone menhirsknown locally as Jean and JeanneAccording to legend they were young lovers whom the druids forbade to marryWhen they disobeyed they were transformed into pillars of rock and placed where they could see each other but never meetOnce every 100 years they resume their human shapes and renew their embracesanyone who sees them then is turned to stoneFlaubertwho visited the island in 1847got lost in these deserteddeceptively placid fieldsof which he wroteOne would have said that all those who owned them profited from them but did not like themHe preferred the shorewhere the long vistas of rocks with their thick coverings of seaweed appeared to him as the heads of black phantoms emerging from the underworldand the grottos were full of strange brilliantly coloured rocks and polished white beds of gravel which seemed about to receive the water-nymph when she emerged from the wavesLike FlaubertI left Belle-Ile

why few British skiers choose the cantonsBy CHRIS GILLTHOSE who care about such things are at present locked in combat over the issue of whether the greatest number of British skiers go to Austria which traditionally enjoys the distinctionor to France which is the flavour of the decadeBothaccording to the latest figures conjured out of a hat by the Frenchhave just over 35 per cent of the marketOf much more interest to Alp-watchers is the performance of the other great Alpine skiing nationsThe French reckon that Italy now gets 7 per cent of our custom andmore surprisinglythat Switzerland gets only 5 per centOnce upon a timethis might have been 95 per centThis is partly a consequence of simple arithmeticSwitzerland has lots of Alpsbut they are now less densely equipped with skiers' dormitories than those of France and AustriaMany of the big names of Swiss skiing have fewer than 10,000 bedsthe total for Val d'Isere/Tignes approaches 50,000But it is more a consequence of the view we have of Switzerland and of Swiss skiingA dominant factor is the idea that Switzerland is expensiveIt is not entirely without foundationholidaying on the cheap in such places as super-smart St MoritzZermatt and Gstaad is next to impossiblewhatever the tourist offices there might sayBut it is not expensive when you compare like with like that iswhen you compare French with SwissOf courseif you squeeze yourself and your mates into a compactstudio and live on bread and cheeseyou can live more cheaply in France than in a Swiss hotelBut in the important area of mountain lunchesfor examplemy experiences and the distilled findings of those who report to The Good Skiing Guide on such matterspoint to parity between France and Switzerlandwith Austria and Italy providing worthwhile savingsIt remains true that Switzerland is not a place for convenienceskiing in the way that France isSki areas tend to be as fragmented now as they were 20 or 30 years agoIn some cases this may be attributable to the Swiss tendency to conserve moneynot naturein othersthe terrain makes links between areas impracticable or unnecessaryZermattfor exampleis a resort where many skiers must have wished for better linksIn Davos and St Moritzthe areas are so widely spread and rewarding individually that the idea of linking them scarcely arisesOne resort seizing the bull by the horns is little old Adelbodenwhich for 1991 is building a big new gondola to link two of its smaller ski areas to its major oneWhatever its weaknessesSwitzerland always has a couple of aces up the sleeveThe first is that there are no Alps like the Swiss AlpsThe FrenchItalian and Austrian Alps have their spectaclesbut they are not presented so conveniently for the the idle downhill skier or even non-skieras the great set-pieces of the SwissThe second ace is the country's near-monopoly of traditional traffic-free villages or what pass for traffic-free villages in these days of electric taxis and busesIt is from these villages and their ski areas that the most impressive mountain scenery is to be seenThe famous trio of EigerMonch and Jungfrau loom over the pistes of tiny British-dominated Wengenand are seen to even better advantage from even tinier Murren the one resort which genuinely is traffic-freeMoney-dominated Zermatt is synonymous with the unreal pyramid of the Matterhorn which is unrecognisably ordinary when seen from Italian Cervinianext doorThe peaks surrounding glacier-dominated Saas Fee may be less distinguishedbut the ice-falls of the Feegletscher hanging over the village are in their way just as strikingOf coursewe must not forget that these are ski resortsWengen's skiing is extensivebut for piste skiers is mostly easyMurren is very limitedwith one spectacular descent from the famous SchilthornZermatt has something for everyone and lots for expertsbut to reach its full potential needs better snow than it often receivesSaas Fee has an excellent glacierbut again needs abundant snow to provide much more than that in particularto satisfy better skiersBut the quality and quantity of the skiing to be done in these places is almost a secondary considerationPerhaps that explains why most British skiers aren't inclined to go to Switzerland and why a minority wouldn't dream of going anywhere elseSkiing UpdateRunway enterpriseBy CHRIS GILLEXETER-BASED InStyle

bride who stepped out of an old white Daimlertanned beneath her white silkVery bourgeoisbut that is probably what Bruges has always beenThe patrons of all this art were merchants in the thirteenth centurywho profited from cloth manufactureFrom the fourteenth to fifteenth centuriesBruges was the chief market of the powerful Hanseatic trading leagueAt the end of the fifteenth centuryone enterprising family realised there was money to be made from all the foreign merchantsand turned their house into sort of prototype stock exchangeThe family nameBeurzeexplains the origins of the name for similar operations all over the ContinentTheir house is now a bankNowadays the bourgeoisie is more likely to patronise the city's luxurious food and clothes shopsall housed in the medieval streetsThe oldest tavern is the Vlissingheof which mention was first made in 1552but there are hundreds of little bars and cafesmany of them housed in olde-worlde buildings that have the Americans squealing with delightPlenty have terraces from which to watch the world go by accompanied by a hot waffle or a glass of beerThere were once 40 breweries in Brugesand although now there are only twothe choice of Belgian beers is still enormousOne cafe lists 300My richdark Trappist practically knocked me for six at lunchtimewhile a deep red cherry beerKriektasted like alcoholic cough

of eel in a green herb sauceAn enormous bowl of mussels cooked in a delicious liquor with celeryonionparsley and plenty of black pepper can be had for about £4The open air fish market does brisk business every morning except Sunday and Monday and is well worth a visit for its display of fresh and smoked specialitiesas well as a huge range of shellfishIt is best not to leave eating too lateBruges goes to bed early and can hardly be said to be throbbing with night-lifeLast weekend the highlights were marionettes miming to Die Fledermaus at the puppet theatre and a country music festivalWe did try a night cap in a classical music pubbut as it was in the underground of a shopping arcadeand the clientele seemed more interested in chomping through their steak and chips than appreciating Karajan's version of the Emperor Concertowe just had the oneOnce fully saturated with culturefooddrink or any combination of the threeit is possible to escape the tourist honeypotswhich are mostly in the centre and south of townTo the north the streets are quieterand by following the canals a smelly exercise in high summerno doubtor simply the end of your noseBruges can be appreciated on a more domestic scaleThe flat-fronted facades are often decorated with intricate brickworkand even modern restorations seem to be strictly controlled in a style that combines discreet Post-Modern twiddly with forms and colours that are in the spirit of the originalThere are few cars herethough lots of bicyclesvery few dogs and almost no dog mess even the horse-drawn buggies for
