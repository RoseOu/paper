between themshe hugs Elaine a lot and they are very closeMy old mumElaine calls herI would describe Elaine as beautiful with sexy legsjokes SylviaAndmore seriouslyI try to do things the way she wantsStaff who have worked in the homes become institutionalisedthey say this is the way we've always done itBut if you employ someone in your houseyou want them to do it your waynot theirsThe nurses who come in the evenings and at weekends are from an agency which can meanfor Elainea new face every night of the weekEvery new nurse needs detailed instructions about how to care for her down to details such as pulling her bra on properly and making sure she is dry before getting her dressedPlease treat me normallyI'm not daftMy brain is perfectly unimpairedwrites Elaine at the end of her listThe nurses are nicewell-intentioned young girls who do their bestBut because they have to leave by 10pmall they have time for are the basic taskssuch as cooking dinnerfeeding Elainetaking off her make-up and getting her ready for bedMany of them are not used to disabled peopleandbeing temporarythey rarely get to know her anywayElaine can't talk and that can be very disconcerting for the nursessays SylviaElaine interruptsShe does not need nurses in uniformshe almost shoutsjust because she is disabledit does not mean she is medically illThere is no conversation with the nursesshe

same town and it still hurts her to see himFor a while Elaine was cared for by young volunteers who used to come and stay with her for a few months at a timeBut the volunteers moved on to college or jobs and she found the change unsettlingIn 1986 she contacted her local authority for helpit was thenshe saysthat her life changed for the worseNorthampton social services department says the problem

laughs a lotShe seems like a very happy personsays SylviaBut it's false it hides a lot of sadnessHealthFaithcouragewill and a cancer therapyThe Gerson technique ended her marriage and took over her lifebut Renee Henry believes it worksLiz Hunt reportsBy LIZ HUNTRENEE HENRY remembers quite clearly when she decided that she was going to liveIt was a warmsunny afternoon four years agoand she was lying on her back in the park feeling too weak to moveShe could hear her three- year-old son Rufus laughing as he played on the swings nearbyHer other sonBarnesjust six months oldwas asleep in the pram beside herThe thought of not being there for them as they grew up was too much to bearshe saidI had to get wellRenee Henry was a rare birdaccording to her surgeonAt the age of 33 she had breast cancerBut in the months following the diagnosisMrs Henry found that it was not only a life-threatening disease that she had to contend withHer decision to refuse orthodox medical treatment and follow an alternativeregime the Gerson therapy provoked outrage and hostility from her husbandher family and her friendsAt a time when I needed all possible supportI was left alonesaid Mrs HenryLike most people who are told they have cancerRenee Henry wasat firstin shockShe didn't think to question the treatment her doctors advocated as a research biochemist who had worked in the pharmaceutical industry for 10 yearsthe benefits of modern medicine had been instilled in herShe underwent a lumpectomy and then a course of radiotherapyand was due to start drug treatment when she met another cancer patientThis woman was 37 years oldand she too had had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy four years earlierShe had taken drugs ever sincebut the cancer had returnedWhen I heard that I went straight into the toilet and threw upShe was just like meshe had been told that her prognosis was good and yet here she was four years laterI didn't want to live with cancer hanging over meI walked out of the hospital and didn't go backMrs Henry found out all she could about alternative cancer treatments and dabbled in some of themAt this timeI was living in a sort of Walter Mitty worldI had a husband who was pretending that I did not have cancerand a mother who tried to inspire me by showing me pictures of Page Three girls under banner headlines of How I conquered cancerThey were both trying to persuade me to continue with the radiotherapy and drugsMrs Henry embarked on a course in herbal medicine and it was during this that she heard about the Gerson therapyShe learnt that it had been developed in the 1920s by a German physicianDr Max GersonHe had suffered severe migraine which did not respond to conventional treatmentHe had experimented with various foods and found that by restricting his diet to one of fresh fruits and vegetables he could control his migraineSome of Dr Gerson's patients including those with TB tried the dietTheir health improved and a cure was claimed in many casesMore patients with various illnesses were put on the dietand good results were reportedDr Gerson became convinced that the treatment helped the body to heal itselfregardless of the nature of the diseaseThis diet now forms the basis of the Gerson Cancer TherapyIt claims to eliminate toxins from the bodyto restore a normal potassium and sodium balance in cells which is thought to be disturbed in cancer patientsto boost liver function also affected by the diseaseand to reactivate certain enzymesThe more Renee Henry learnt about the therapythe more she became convinced that it was right for herThe therapy is a full-time occupationIt involves taking 13 juices every hourThey are freshly prepared from organic fruit and vegetables and consist of four carrot and apple juicesfour green leaf juicesfour juices extracted from calves' liver and one orange juiceOatssalads and baked potatoes form the basis of three daily mealsCaffeine enemas are given four hourlyas well as castor oil orally or by enema to aid detoxificationAt this pointthe strain on Renee Henry's marriage became too muchand what had been a troubled relationship crumbledThe day my husband left was the day I started Gerson in earnestI went to a shop that sold organic food and bought everythingThat was the start of the two most demanding years of her lifeShe had to commit herself totally to the therapywhile looking after two young childrenLarge quantities of organic food were not easy to come by in SurreyAt night I would wrap the children in blanketsput them in the carand drive down to New Covent Garden to collect the fruit and vegetablesShe suffered chronic diarrhoea and vomiting asshe saysher body started to detoxify itselfIt was like having a severe bout of food poisoning that never got bettershe recalledI developed chronic asthma and eczema and cold soresAnd all the timeI was working away until midnight preparing the juicesThree months into the therapy she began to suffer severe psychological traumas she says she was in a state of constant terrorThis is the point at which many patients give up the therapysaid Mrs HenryBut she underwent counsellingand also received support from Sheila McLeana Gerson therapist and former nurseTodayRenee Henry is convinced that she is cured and that the Gerson therapy is responsibleShe acknowledges that such a claim cannot be substantiated because she also received orthodox medical treatmentShe refuses to undergo any medical checks because she has no need of further proofMrs Henry's encounter with cancer hasnot surprisinglychanged her lifeNext week is Europe Against Cancer Weekand she and Sheila Mclean are launching a charity called the Karnak Charitable TrustIt aims to make more information about Gerson availablefund research projectsand eventually it hopes to set up a centre for people who want to try itin combination with psychological counsellingaccording to Renee HenryIn fighting cancerthe most critical point is when you decide that you are going to surviveYou need a focus for that desire to liveso you pick a therapyorthodox or alternativeand you use itBut the most important thing is to believe that you will surviveHealth UpdateCrack connection with AidsBy OLIVIA TIMBSTHERE is much concern in the US about the addiction to crackpurified cocainewithin inner-city communitiesDoctors are worried that women turning to prostitution to finance the habit are at risk of contracting AidsThis problem has spread to the UKIn the past two monthsdoctors at the Regional Addiction Treatment Unit in Birmingham have come across five patients addicted to crackThree are prostitutes introduced to the drug by pimpsAccording to themcrack is widely available in Birmingham and most prostitutes they know use it dailyThe doctors point out in the British Medical Journal thatthough crack dependency is not a direct risk factor for Aidsprostitutes trying to maintain expensive crack habits may be tempted into unsafe sex practiceswhich in turn may lead to an increase in the spread of AidsHealth UpdateZinc deficiency in pregnancyBy OLIVIA TIMBSFADS for vitamin supplements have been overtaken by a vogue for minerals and trace elementsZinc is the latestlack of it supposedly causes a range of problemsalthough little scientific evidence supports the linkBut some reports have suggested that low zinc levels may lead to problems in pregnancyfrom difficult labour to congenital malformations in childrenThere is stronger evidence that a zinc deficiency may cause the foetus to grow slowly in the wombDoctors in Bristol decided to test the theoryIn a study of nearly 500 womenthey found that zinc supplements did not improve either foetal health or reduce the number of pre-term laboursThe doctors conclude in the British Medical Journal that there would be little benefit if all women in the UK were given zinc supplements during pregnancyThey recognisehoweverthat the women in their study were largely middle-classwho might well have sufficiently large zinc stores because they were well nourishedFurther studiesthe researchers believeshould concentrate on pregnant women known to have a zinc deficiency or to be at risk from problems during labourHealthAlternative cures not provenBy OLIVIA TIMBSRENEE HENRY underwent a lumpectomy and radiotherapy for her breast cancerDr Maurice Slevina consultant physician at the department of medical oncology at St Bartholomew's HospitalLondonsaid the chances of a woman being alive and well four years after such treatment were at least 75 per centMrs Henry refused the drug treatment given to reduce the chances of a relapsebut there are many who would remain well without itDr Slevin saidPart of the attraction of alternative cancer treatments such as the Gerson therapy is that they allow a patient to feel more in control of the treatmentDr Slevin agreed that this is often beneficialbut is concerned about other aspects of such therapiesVery few have been evaluatedand the evidence is largely anecdotalhe saidSome of the treatments have dramatic side-effectsIf they do workthat is wonderful but we have no way of knowing for sureThere have been no controlled trials of the Gerson therapyIf one of my patients wants to give up a potentially curative treatment in favour of an alternative therapythen I will try to dissuade themBut it is essentially up to the patientHe said the NHS should address itself more to the needs of cancer patients so that they do not feel they have to go outside the systemThey should be offered relaxation therapy and stress managementand advice on diet and exercisehe saidThe Imperial Cancer Research Fund and the Cancer Research Campaign are conducting a joint study of the Bristol Cancer Help Centrewhich offers a holistic programme dietary advice and emotional counselling to complement medical treatment
