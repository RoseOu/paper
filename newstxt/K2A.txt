Why Keiran Goss left the law for the guitarStar of the County DownAt the end of the dayit is as a songwriter that I would most like to be rememberedA QUALIFIED solicitor who has practised law is currently one of the biggest draws on the Irish music sceneThe only case Kieran Goss has ever handled is the one which contains the tool of his chosen trade the guitarFor the talented CoDown man with the droll line in laid back stage patter is now established as a leading figure in the ever swelling ranks of Irish singer/songwritersHe has forged a highly successful partnership with the Dublin singer Frances Black sister of the famous Mary and his songs are being coveredby other performers as far away as JapanSoat the age of 31instead of standing in court in a pinstripe making pleas in mitigation for the Saturday night disorderly drunkshe is on the road to famesuitcase and guitar in handHow did it all beginLike his close musical friendsthe Sands FamilyKieran was born in the townland of Mayobridge near NewryShowsHe was one of a family of 15 raised by Newry garage owner Billy Goss and his wife Bridieand since two of his older brothers played the guitar it was not long before young Kieran was picking out those three main chords himselfBy the time he went to Abbey CBS in Newry he was already regaling school shows and family parties with the songs of 1970's singer-strummers like Ralph McTell and Tom PaxtonIn 1980 he arrived at Queen's University to study law and at the end of his first year flew out to the USA to find summer jobs as labourerBut I only stuck that for a couple of weekshe saysfor I was playing guitar at a party one night in ClevelandOhioand he said there were easier ways of making money out there than working the building sitesSo he got me a few gigs round the Irish pubsand I had to learn off some traditional Irish ballads quickly for the sort of audiences you got there certainly didn't want to hear me singing songs by James Taylor or Simon and GarfunkelSupportIt was just a bit of crackbut curiously enough it gave me my first taste of playing in publicsomething I had not yet done back homeReturning to Queen'she asked forand gota few gigs in the students' union my very first one was as support act to Blackthornand soon he was working once or twice a week round the local pubs and folk clubsOn that demanding circuithe served his time to the troubadour's tradelearning how to handle an audienceand going home to his law booksAt the end of 1985 he qualified as a solicitor this was the safety net and I had written my thesis on the copyright lawswhich has been very useful to mebut he had already decided to take the plunge as a full time professional musicianFor the next four years or so he lived the nomadic life of the minstrelheading off in his car round the well worn folk circuits of GermanyItaly and Brittany and playing everywhere from cafes to pizza parloursDecisionSounds idyllic he was young and having fun earning a living at what he liked bestBut by 1989 I was at the crossroadshe saysTouring on my own was good crackbut I wanted security and it was time to make a serious decision about the future whether to become a lawyer and I had already started applying for jobsor to take a more businesslike approach to the musicHe opted for the latter and at the end of 1989 he launched his debut album Brand New Starwhich sold very wellgot a lot of radio playandmost important of allit introduced the songs he had been composing and singing at concerts to a wider publicMary Black recorded two of themAs a songwriterhe was now on his wayHis next big career break came about almost by accidentFrances Black had been touring with the traditional band Arcady but in 1990 was asked to do a few solo gigs in the northShe needed a backing guitarist and asked Kieranwho she had met once or twice on the roadwould he help outChemistryWe hardly knew each otherbut I agreedthinking it would be a short term thinghe saidBut those few gigs we didwith me playing guitar and singing harmonieswent down a bomb and we have been partners ever sinceWe have never worked out what the chemistry isbut the audiences liked it and we realised Heywe've got something hereand really set to work on itNext thing we were playing support on a Mary Black tour and from doing folk club gigs for maybe 100 customers I suddenly found myself doing 20 nights in a row in front of 2,000 people or moreFirst albumThe duo's first album has Irish sales of 27,000 so farand is also to be released Japanof all placeswhere Kieran's songs are so popular that two of them have been recorded by a local singer the lyrics translated into JapaneseHe finds it hard to talk about what that sounds like without laughingOur album opened doors for us all over the worldhe saysand another major factor in our success was that one of the songs on itWall Of Tearswas included on the Women's Heart C.D. which has already sold over 200,000 copies in Ireland aloneTHAT was a really important break for usand helped to push us a few more rungs up the ladderDuring July we were on the Women's Heart tour 28 gigs in 30 nightspacked houses all the wayI really enjoyed itbut I was glad when it was over for it was very tiringKieran has now Rostrevor home to Dublin for six months where he intendsas he puts itto lie lowfor a whilewriting songs and preparing for his and Frances's second albumLike Franceswho has a familyI'd like to spend a bit more time at homehe saidfor I have a lot of material on tape and you can't write songs when you're on the roadAt the end of the dayit is as a songwriter that I would most like to be rememberedIf I had to choose between the twoI could live without performing but not without song writingIt's what I enjoy mostSafety netAnd as for the lawIt now looks as if that safety net is never going to be neededWho was it said Let other men write my country's lawsbut let me write its songsWhoever it washe and Kieran Goss would have been kindred soulsPianist's fingers sparedTHE conductor Alan Tongue tells me this heart-warming little story with a touch of the Scarlet Pimpernels about itAlan was in London talking business with his agentAudrey Ellisonwhen she just happened to mention a letter she had received from a friend in Budapest about a young pianist who was about to be hauled into the Hungarian army to do his national serviceThe only thing that would save him would be work abroadYou can imagine what a spell in the Army would have meant for someone who values his fingers as a pianistso when I came back home I got in touch with some people and now he has been booked for a number of festivalsAlan tells meThe pianistAttila Pertiswho is just 27will now appear at Armagh and Ballymena festivals next month and will also attend master classesNot only thatbut Alan and his friends have also managed to get him a recital in the Barbican in LondonAlan himself is off on his travels again later this monthwhen he will work

Lipsitz on August 26As this will be my final Thursday columnI felt that I should express my feelings at what I see as a matter which will be of deep concern to the entire jazz fraternity in Northern IrelandFor many years Ialong with everyone else who takes an interest in jazz both here and further afieldhave read and respected the forthright and honest views of a jazz critic who is without equal in our communityNot only does he write with total integrity but also with a respect for the language which is becoming increasingly rareI have been a personal friend for many yearsbut that has never prevented him from criticising my colleagues and myself whenever he felt it necessary to do soAnd I respect him for thatI know of no-one else who has the same depth of knowledge of the subject and who can write with such articulationWe will all miss reading his incisive and valuable commentsIt is a pity thatat a time when there is a resurgence of interest in jazz here in the provincethe most experienced writer will no longer be read on a regular weekly basisWe all owe Solly a deep debt of gratitude for his services to the cause of jazz for so many yearsWALTER LOVEPipe band blows its own

allegations of a child sex scandal has as his current refuge one of the world's great hotelsThe plush Raffles Hotelnow under siege from several hundred of his fansis a breathtaking reminder of colonial eleganceEntering one of the 104 spacious suites is like stepping into a time warpIn the early decades of this centurythe hotel was a favoured haunt for kingsqueensmovie starsauthors and other notablesEach £280 a night room is divided into a living room with dining and TV areabedroom and magnificent marbled dressing room and bathroomOriginal furnituresilverchina and furnishings complete the colonial atmosphereBut this old world tranquillity of the hotel is broken by the frenetic demands of the rock star's retinue of security guards and personal cooksThe hubbub outside comes not from the picturesque traders of the bazaar but from some 500 fans pleading for a glimpse of their idolMaster craftsman to inspire Kilkenny DJ's just the man to rock GalwayTHE brilliant and well documented hurling skills of Kilkenny's DJ Carey will go a long way towards determining the outcome of today's big match in Croke ParkDisplaying remarkable maturity for a 22-year-old he has emerged in the last 18 months as the game's outstanding personalitya player blessed with the full range of skillssomeone with an unflappable temperament to matchHe has the knack of scoring crucial goals and making it all appear so easythe real mark of a master craftsmanAntrim will certainly vouch for that given that Carey was responsible for two goals and five points in their All Ireland semi-final defeatIn last season's All Ireland decider he again stole the show with a goal and four pointsThis season he has been equally prolificInevitableThe two goals and five points he conjured up against Antrim leaves him nine points clear of Wexford's Tom Dempsey in the scoring chartsand in virtually an unassailable positionOff the field he takes the inevitable acclaim and adulation in his strideHe saidTo be honest it's nice that people recognise your achievementsBut at the end of the day you have to go out and prove yourselfor else it counts for nothingespecially in a hurling mad county like KilkennyHere you're only as good as your last gameand really that's the way it should beThe phrase level-headed could have been coined with Carey in mindHe's youngsupremely talented and an integral part of a successfulhigh profile sideSeveral young emerging stars in a wide range of sportsin similar pressurised situationshave caved in under the intense media spotlightBut there appears little prospect of this superstar falling victim to such hypeHe simply puts his head down and keeps on scoring goals lots of themJust ask AntrimOffaly and WexfordAll have found to their cost that on his game there's simply no stopping the hurling geniusReflecting on the rise and rise of Kilkenny hurling he saidWe struggled the whole way through 1991yet reached an All Ireland finalTwelve months ago we came on leaps and boundsand surprised even ourselves by winning the All IrelandThe lads have all knitted in together extremely welland we appear reasonably settledapart from a few niggling injuriesSignificantly he addedThere is also a bit of bottle in this teamThey simply won't accept defeatno matter how badly things might appearWE WILLWE WILL ROCK YOUDJ Carey has all the skills necessary to inspire Kilkenny to glory against Galway this afternoon
