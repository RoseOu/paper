Tigrayans advance on a helpless Addis AbabaFrom RICHARD DOWDEN in Addis AbabaTHE ETHIOPIAN army is failing to halt northern rebels advancing rapidly southwards to the capital and its vital lifeline roadSome observers are predicting the imminent collapse of the military regime which has ruled Ethiopia for 15 yearsThe rebelsthe Tigrayan People's Liberation Front TPLFare threatening to cut off Desea key garrison town protecting part of the road linking Addis Ababa with the port of AssabThey have advanced down the Asmara road in the past four weeks and are now reported to be operating south of DeseThey have surrounded a garrison at Batito the eastand on 19 September they attacked Mile on the Assab roadclosing it for 36 hoursHelicopter gunships ply constant missions from their base at Kombolchayesterday I watched MiG-21 fighter-bombersloaded with bombs and rocketstake off from Dire Dawa and head westThe estimated 40,000 troops in Dese are being joined by the remnants of the defeated Third Armywhich is struggling down the road or surrendering to the rebelsOne estimate puts government losses in the past four weeks at 20,000 killedcaptured or desertedThe government in Addis Ababa will say nothing about the situationand the war is not reported by the state-run mediaHoweverrecent visitors to Dese describe the areas as chaoticwith whole units leaderless and unwilling to fightSoviet advisers have been withdrawn from Dese and KombolchaA Soviet Deputy Defence MinisterGeneral Varrenikovhas been in Addis Ababa for the past weekHe is reported to be negotiating the complete withdrawal of the 1,500 Soviet military advisersThe Russians have said they believe in a negotiated settlement to the civil warbut they are continuing to supply arms to President Mengistuapparently to allow him to negotiate from a position of strengthA large consignment of weapons was unloaded from a Soviet ship at Assab on 21 SeptemberWeapons will nothoweversave President Mengistu if no one is willing to use themThe Ethiopian armythe biggest in sub-Saharan Africaconsists largely of press-ganged young peasants or unemployed urban teenagers who have been drafted to the front after a few weeks' trainingAt the end of a spectacularly successful yearthe TPLF drove the Ethiopian army out of Tigray province in FebruaryFew people thought the Tigrayans could continue their success outside their own provincebut on 26 August the TPLF began an advance which drove the government forces out of Korem and KoboThree weeks agothe 102nd Airborne DivisionRussian-trained and regarded as a crack unitwas rushed from its base at Asmara to the front linebut it too has been mauled by the rebelswho swept through the mountains flanking the main roadcapturing all the towns as far as WoldiyaMeanwhilein Eritreato the northa de facto ceasefire is holding between the government and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front EPLFwhich is seeking independence for EritreaPeace talks began in AtlantaGeorgialast month and are due to resume in Nairobi on 18 NovemberThe only government-controlled areas in highland Eritrea are the road between Asmara and Massawa and the garrisons of KerenSenafe and Adi KwalaGovernment troops are digging deep defences at Asmara and there is no doubt thatshould the peace talks failthe EPLF will resume fighting and attack itor try to cut it offOne option for the TPLF is to strike eastto the Assab-Addis Ababa roadIf they succeed in cutting itthey will have achieved checkmateThey could strike west and try to cut off Gonderanother heavily-fortified garrisonor they could try to continue rolling south towards the capitalAddis Ababa is guarded by about 20,000 troopsincluding President Mengistu's Praetorian guardwhich saved him during the coup attempt in MayNo one believes the TPLF can take the capitalbut their continuing success could persuade senior army officers that President Mengistu should be replaced by someone who can stop the war and negotiateThe situation is veryvery fluid and there is a possibility that the regime will disintegratesaid one Western diplomatThe TPLF has recently transformed itself into the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Movement to give itself more national credibilitybut its core remains the Marxist-Leninist League of Tigraywhose political model seems closest to the late Enver Hoxha's AlbaniaMuch as many Ethiopians fear and loathe the governmentthey are calling for more political and economic freedomand would not feel liberated by the TPLFNor would they welcome a takeover by the TigrayansMost of the people between Dese and the capital are Maharan and OromoNeverthelessthere have been several incidents in the capital recentlyBombs were placed in the fuel depot at the airport last monthand a small power station nearby was blown upTribalism and liberation meet at Transkei burialFrom JOHN CARLIN in BumbaneTranskeiWHEN is an independent state not an independent stateWhen it's a homelandBumbaneotherwise known as the Great Placeis the royal burial site of the Tembu tribe here in what South Africa insists on calling the Republic of Transkeia so-called homelandfor black people upon which Pretoria imposed political independence in 1976This helps explain the extraordinary spectacle here yesterday of 5,000 loudly anti-colonialblack people clamouring against independence and for political re-integration with South AfricaThe occasion was that black South African specialitythe political funeralBehind it all was the hand of Nelson Mandelawhich may lend the event much significance should it turn out that President FW de Klerk is serious about negotiating with black leadersMr Mandela belongs to the royal family of the Tembu tribeThe man buried yesterday was the king of the Tembusthe most powerful of the half dozen tribes who speak the Xhosa languageSince there are six million Xhosas one million more than the entire white population of South Africa they are potentially a serious force for Mr de Klerk to reckon withThey count among their number more than 70 per cent of the leaders in the executive of the African National CongressThe ANC does not like this fact to be mentionedbecause it purports to eschew tribalism in favour of an all-embracing black nationalismAll the more oddthenthat yesterday's funeral should have been both a celebration of time-honoured Tembu ritual and the most vocal demonstration in years on what the rest of the world calls South African soil of the strength of the ANC and its far from tribalistic affiliatethe South African Communist PartyThe imprisoned Mr Mandela has met in recent months more than a dozen of the chieftains and assorted dignitaries his Xhosa wifeWinnieamong them who were on the podiumYesterday not only were the Xhosas out in forceit seemed that a convention of the entire Mass Democratic Movement essentially the exiled ANC's internal representatives had been calledKing Sabata Dalindyebo would have been pleasedHe died three years agoBut his body was exhumed last Monday for the ceremonial reburial yesterdayThe problem had been that there was no ceremony the first time aroundHe was buriedunder orders from the corrupt and usurping Matanzima brothers who used to run Transkeiin a commoner's graveThe Matanzimas were forced out after a military coup nearly two years agoThe benign ruler who took overMajor-General Bantu Holomisaspoke at the gravesideIn so doing he also gave his blessing to what in effect proved to be the case declaring the Transkeior at least Bumbanethe first ANC liberated zonehowever fleetinglyyesterday afternoonDraped over the king's coffin was an ANC flagHe had vehemently opposed Transkei's bogus independence andhounded by the Matanzimashad fled to Zambiawhere he joined the ANCMuch plotting went into the organisation of the eventMajor-General Holomisa met the president of the ANC in London recentlyHis brotherwho lives in the same housespoke with Mr Mandela for five hours on 4 AugustMrs Mandela has been shuttling back and forth with messages from her husband's prison home near Cape TownThe tribal leaders who visited Mr Mandela have also met the top ANC leaders in ZambiaThe upshot of it all is that Major-General Holomisa has made Transkei a haven of sortsa thorn in Pretoria's sidefor the ANCHe will no doubt tread very carefullybut the consequences of his stand could be far-reachingHe said yesterday that he meant to conduct a referendum to test whether Transkei's three million people wished to retain independenceor notIf the answer is noSouth Africa may have to confront the beginning of the end of the homelandssystemSwapo remains favourite to win the United Nations-supervised elections next

there is a hint of magic in the airThe winter migrations are beginningand the skies over northern India are alive with transiting birdsIn the next few weeksas the seasons change in eastern Europe and central Asiaspectacular colonies of painted storks will descend on the lakes and marshes of Uttar Pradesh and RajasthanThey will be followed by flocks of pintail ducks and greylag geeseTens of thousands of birdsnavigating with miraculous precisionarrive each year at their Indian winter homesBut for one tiny group of exquisitely beautiful long-distance travellersthe coming journey may prove their lastSomewhere along the Ob river in central Siberiaslowly building strength for a 3,500-mile flightwait perhaps 50 Siberian cranesThey areas far as naturalists are awarethe only surviving

reached IranThe Siberian crane stands four and a half feet tallits brilliant white plumage offset by a blood-red beakface and legsJet-black wing quills are visible in flightLike most birdwatchersI have only seen them in pictures -invariably in supremely elegant posestheir longthin beaks delicately probing the water for weedsUnlike most birdwatchersI am lucky enough to live less than four hours' drive from their regular winter home a wildfowl marsh constructed by one of the Maharajahs of BharatpurI was there recentlytalking to Dr Lalitha Vijayam about her research on the Siberian crane's problems and about my chances of seeing one before the Ob river race becomes extinctThe Maharajahs of Bharatpur were dedicated huntersfamous for their prodigious shootsA plaque in the Bharatpur marshes records the November day in 1938 that the then Viceroy of IndiaLord Linlithgowbagged 4,373 wildfowl3,044 of them before lunchThe royal guns did not fall silent at Bharatpur until 1964Soon afterthanks largely to the endeavours of India's finest ornithologistSalim Alithe ex-Maharajah's swamp was turned into a sanctuary unequalled in AsiaIt is now formally known as the Keoladeo Ghana National Parkand its own guide book charmingly and accurately boastsBirdsBirdsEverywhere BirdsOf all the species visible in Bharatpurnone is more romantic or mysterious than the Siberian craneThere are many suitably marshy habitats in the Ganges basinyet the bird has invariably stopped at BharatpurThere are other beautiful cranes in the park my favourite is the demoisellea slender grey bird with delightful black plumes and ear-tuftsBut no other bird exerts quite the appeal of the annual visitor from the river ObEvery year the Indian newspapers chart Siberian crane sightings with the devotion and enthusiasm the British press usually only musters at times of royal birthsDr Vijayana research scientist with the Bombay Natural History Societyis leading a study of the Siberian crane that began in 1980She confesses her team can only guess at the causes of the bird's declineWe think they are being shot for meat when they land in Afghanistanshe saidAnd we know that some have been poached in PakistanThe cranes may also have suffered from Bharatpur's environmental problemsScientists are trying to calculate the long-term impact of the catastrophic drought of 1987There have been rows over cattle-grazing and other encroachmentFortunatelythis year's monsoon was short but sharpand improved water management has produced good floodsDr Vijayan also reports that after a long struggle to arouse their interestPakistani environmentalists are aware of the threat to the birdBut the war rages on in Afghanistanand crane protection is understandably a low priority in KabulThe warand the region's complex geopolitical concernsare also preventing naturalists from undertaking the most effective means of monitoring the Siberian crane ringing the flock with miniature transmitters that could be tracked from spaceThe prospect of MoscowKabulIslamabad and New Delhi all agreeing on a joint satellite monitoring venture is not greatThe scientists can only wait and hopeWhich is what I shall be doing for the next three monthsGiven the awesome sum of human misery in this part of the worldI suppose I shouldn't get too worked up about the fate of a flock of birds particularly as the much larger eastern race of the Siberian cranewhich migrates from north-eastern Yakutia to the lower reaches of the Yangtse river in Chinais apparently surviving wellBut if the snow-wreaths of the Ob river don't reach Bharatpur this yearI shall feel inescapably sadRussians send Kabul 2,000 supply trucksFrom AHMED RASHID in KabulTHE SOVIET UNION is supplying the Afghan government with another 2,000 trucks to step up the supply of foodfuel and ammunition to Kabul's 1.5 million people before the winter snows affect the roadsThe unconditional Soviet support to the Kabul regime is on such a scale that the US and Pakistan cannot hope to match itEvery few minutes a truck thunders down the strategic Salang Highway on its way from Hiratan on the Soviet border to KabulConvoys half a mile long are watched over by scattered Afghan army outposts on the hills by the roadDrivers report no guerrilla attackseven though security north of the Salang Tunnel has been largely handed over to local militia

survive the winter37,000 tonnes have already been stockpiledGeneral Hakim saidAfghan and diplomatic sources said that the Soviets would provide 2,000 more trucks and fuel tankersbut General Hakim admitted that the real problem will be fuelwhich is already in short supply in KabulDiesel prices on the black markeat are ten times higher than the official priceEven for some government carsdiesel is only available on the black marketFor the past few weeks President Najibullah has been meeting militia commanders from around the country offering them more weapons and money to maintain their loyalty and keep the roads openSince all private truck owners are now allowed to bring food from Hiratan and sell it in Kabulsome militia commandersmost of them former mujahedinare buying trucks and becoming tradersThe Soviet relief effort is also employing aircraftUp to 40 flights a day bring in weapons and ammunitionincluding Frog 7sa short range surface-to-surface missile that is less

presidentFerdinand Marcosto be returned home from Hawaii for burialAt the behest of Marcos' familyVice-president Salvador LaurelMrs Aquino's estranged deputy and now head of an opposition partyand a group of loyalistswill today attempt to reverse an earlier Supreme Court ruling to uphold Mrs Aquino's decision to prohibit Marcos' returnBut at the weekendalthough Mrs Aquino said she would respect any Supreme Court decisionshe said she had received highly sensitiveinformation that strengthened her resolveShe said yesterday that Marcos's remains may be brought to the Philippines when emotions have subsidedMrs Aquino cited the case of Napoleonwho died in exile in 1821 and remains made a very triumphant returnto France in 1840 when things had settled downMarcos ruled the Philippines for 20 years before Mrs Aquino was swept to office on a wave of people powerin 1986The Aquino government accuses him of having stolen up to US$10bn £6.1bnfrom the country during his reignHe died in Honolulu

Court earlier voted eight to seven to uphold the ban imposed by Mrs AquinoMr Laurel saidNow that he is deadthat makes a lot of differenceDetails of the highly sensitiveinformation have not been made publicbut it is understood to have originated from intelligence and diplomatic sources and probably relates to plans by Marcos loyalists to capitalise on his return to the countryAt meeting on

Israeli tensionsFrom CHARLES RICHARDS in JerusalemTHE ISRAELI cabinet is being called this week to debate for the first time proposals made by Egypt for advancing the search for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflictThe cabinet session billedlike many beforeas crucialis to discuss the 10 points submitted by President Mubarak to clarify Israel's initiative for elections in the occupied territoriesThey have directed a powerful light on the ambiguities of the initiativeThis has not only exposed the underlying differences between Likud and Labour which the initiative papered overThey have also highlighted old rifts and stimulated new ones within the parties themselvesMr Mubarak's proposals were first formally presented to Israel on 16 SeptemberThe Israeli Prime MinisterYitzak Shamirprocrastinated and postponed discussion of the points at the cabinetthe inner cabinetor the top decision-making body known as the forum of foursenior ministersin the hope that the problem would go awayIn the meantimeministers conducted individual diplomatic initiatives on the basis of Egyptian ideas not yet discussed by the governmentThe Defence MinisterYitzhak Rabinmet Mr Mubarak in Cairoand in the USMr Arens and Mr Peres separately met President Mubarak and the US Secretary of StateJames BakerThe two issues at the heart of the disagreement are those which have killed at birth any attempt in the past dozen years to address the Palestinian questionWho speaks for the Palestinians and what are the limits of the Palestinian problemThe first centres on the composition of a Palestinian delegation that would hold talks with Israel in CairoMr Rabin has suggested including Palestinians deported by the IsraelisThis would satisfy demands by the Palestine Liberation Organisation for delegates from outside to underline the principle that the Palestinian issue deals with a whole peopleAt the same timeIsrael could maintain they were still legally residents of the occupied territoriesBut Mr Shamir has given no sign of softening his opposition to any contact with the PLOor with Palestinians from outsideincluding those deported for activities hostile to IsraelAnd the depth of his ideological commitment to maintaining Israel's hold over the West Bank rules out any acceptance of the principle that negotiations should eventually lead to an exchange of land for

WashingtonDEMOCRATIC leaders will make desperate attempts this week to prevent President Bush from claiming a Congressional majority for conservative economic policiessimilar to the one enjoyed by President Reagan in his early yearsThe Democratic leadership in the Senate is anxious to reverse the handsome victory by Mr Bush in the House of Representatives last weekwhen 64 Democrats voted with the Republicans to sweep through a two-year cut in capital gains taxesSenator George Mitchell of Mainethe Democratic majority leader in the Senatesaid yesterday that he was confident that the senior house of Congress would dismantle the temporary tax cutCongressional officials predicthoweverthat a truncated version of the tax break will pass the Senate this weekallowing the White House to trumpet a one-two victory over the relatively untried Democratic leadership on Capitol HillSuch a victory would also permit Mr Bush to claim a Republican-conservative Democrat working majority in Congress for his no new taxesgrowth will solve everythingeconomic policyIt wouldhoweverleave prospects for medium-termor even short-termprogress in solving the federal budget deficit more confused than everThe dispute has left the bipartisan efforts to reduce the deficit inat least temporarytattersThe Republicans claim that the capital gains cut from 28 per cent to 19.6 per cent for two yearswould stimulate investment and create jobsThe Democratic leaders insist that the cut is an unwarranted giveaway to the wealthy which will have no significant effect on the economy and deepen the deficitIn realitythe squabble is more over slogans and symbols left over from the Reagan years than anything substantialThis begs the question why the Democrats and the White House are staging such a divisive quarrelat a time when agreement on a deficit-cutting budget for 1990 is already overdue the nominal deadline passed yesterdaySome pundits suggest that the capital gains tax battle is a shrewd White House softening-up exercise for an even more aggressive assault on the Democratic leaders in the next two to three weeksdesigned to force a 1990 deficit-cutting agreement on Republican termsThis flies in the face of the cautious nature of the Bush administrationCongressional sources believe the White House saw the chance for a quickpsychologically valuable victory over the Democratic leadersEcuador
