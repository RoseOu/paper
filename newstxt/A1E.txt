Latest corporate unbundler reveals laid-back approachRoland Franklinwho is leading a 697m pound break-up bid for DRGtalks to Frank KaneBy FRANK KANEIT SEEMS that Roland Franklinthe latest unbundler to appear in the UKhas made a fatal error in the preparation of his £697m break-up bid for stationery and packaging group DRGHe has not properly investigated the target's dining facilitiesThe 63-year-old head of Pembridge Investmentsthrough which the bid is being mounted saysrule number one in this business isthe more luxurious the luncheon rooms at headquartersthe more inefficient the businessIf he had taken his own rule seriouslyhe would have found out that DRG has a very modest self-service canteen at its Bristol head officeThere are other things he hason his own admissionnot fully investigatedlike the value of the DRG propertiesor which part of the DRG business he would keep after the break upWhen the bid was launched last weekMr Franklin faced some criticism from City commentators on both those countsHe regards the charges as unfoundedOn propertyhe is bluntI do not regard property profits as earningsWe have made a bid of nearly £700m for a company with a book value of £200m we've acknowledged there is some extra worth therebut I cannot see the sort of value they are talking about in propertyIf they can prove it is therewe might pay for itOn the other criticism he is equally dismissiveThat point about the core business is very unfairhe saysIt is difficult to decide when you are an outsider what the business is likeWe would eventually like to do it along with the managementwithin the philosophy we will imposeThe Franklin philosophy was learnt in the US leveraged buyout business at the side of Sir James GoldsmithMr Franklin went there at the end of the 1970safter the collapse of Keyser Ullmanthe merchant bank where he was a director that was rescued by the Bank of EnglandHe feels that Keyser's problems were hastened by an unwise acquisitionHe went to the US because Goldsmith decided that if you wanted to be a capitalist the UK and France were not the places to beAlong with Sir James he found the US much more attractivetaking over and breaking up some fairly hefty US corporationsHe rejects charges that he was partly responsible for the casino atmospherethat gripped US corporate life in the early 1980sWe stirred it upyesbut we never lost any money for anybody and we never added to the unemployment figuresWhat he has learned from Goldsmith the only genius I have ever come acrossis that the holding company is not the most important unit of corporate organisationThe concept of the company does not interest me it's the businesses that are importantIt does not matter whether or not DRG makes sellotape or Basildon Bond it's of no consequence to anybody if somebody else makes themAnd there is always the ultimate unbundler's defence that he will make money for his backersIn a takeover campaign that has already seen vitriolic languagehe responds to the charge that he is mounting the bid to enrich himself and his friends by sayingNobody could take that as a criticism this is an investor groupIt would be a criticism if I was doing it to impoverish myselfSquare MileStock Exchange takes the bull by the hornsBy JOHN MOORESLOW developerconfusing thinker who is liable to cause controversy and conflictThese are the characteristics of the International Stock Exchange's own Taurus programme rather than one of the signs of the zodiacFor years the International Stock Exchange has been attempting to reduce the flow of paper on share transactions through the evolution of a computerised system known as TaurusWith its enthusiasm for acronymsthe exchange has taken the Taurustitle for its computerised settlement masterplan from the full title of the schemethe ponderously named Transfer and Automated Registration of Uncertificated Stock systemSuch a scheme will allow firms operating on the exchange to hold and transfer shares without the need for share certificatesProposals for the development of a Taurus system have been under consideration for much of this decadeButeven at this stagethere are many hurdles to overcomeas a conference of City experts highlighted last weekAt the core of the problems in the development of the Taurus system is the rapidly changing character of financial markets and their structureWhen original objectives were set out in the early 1980s for improving services and reducing costs at the exchange through cutting down on the amount of paperworkmore detailed efforts were made to put the objectives into actionThese were overtaken by the Government's plans to deregulate the British securities marketannounced in 1983which were to lead to Big BangThere were then more pressing prioritiesBut since 1987 there has been added impetus to the development of the Taurus programmetriggered largely by the post-Big Bang boom in share dealing and the subsequent crash in 1987Huge backlogs of work built up in the securities dealers' back offices as deals could not be completed within the exchange's usual accounts periodsAccording to Anthony Preecedirector of operations at investment group Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickersspeaking at last week's conferencethere were at least 13 different design concepts for the future Taurus system under discussion in the City as of March this yearAside from the technological requirements of the new systemother important issues have to be resolvedThe participants in Taurusthe requirements needed for the participantsand the international consequences of the new systemare receiving detailed considerationPotential members of Taurus include the listed companies affected by the schemeregistrarsprivate client brokersretail brokerscustodian banksinstitutional investorsand money brokersYet as Andrew Palmerdeputy finance director at Legal & General Investments warned at the same conferencelike all chainsTaurus is only going to be as strong as its weakest linkAnd technology could easily become the weak link with some participantsHe said that in the last two years he had met very few institutions which had not cut back their system budgets following the 1987 crash in share prices in the stock marketIt would be a serious mistake for them to believe that they could put the whole Taurus market place at jeopardy by cutting back on their Taurus budgetOn the international front Bill Widdisdirector of systems development at the stock exchangeis wary of arguments calling for full transnational integration of share clearing systemsWe must note that the nations of Europe have evolved their national clearing and depository systems over many years andfor many reasonsthey are all different from one anotherhe saysSome systems serve markets in only one member statewhile othersspecialising in cerain types of instrumentsare of European importancehe stressesAny developments towards integration should take this diversity into account and not seek to prescribe a uniform model when national differences do not compromise the objective of efficient and secure international settlementBIIBA-Fimbra battle worsensTHE gentlemanly war between the British Insurance and Investment Brokers Association BIIBAand the Financial IntermediariesManagers and Brokers Regulatory Association Fimbraappears to be escalatingBIIBA has now made a strong complaint to Fimbra about the latter's decision to withdraw from an agreement made on 18 September which would have allowed BIIBA memberswho held existing professional indemnity coverto renew their existing policiesFimbraas the regulatory body of middlemen who sell investment and insurance productsis attempting to require that these intermediaries hold professional indemnity insurance cover through a centralised scheme provided by FimbraThe insurance cover is designed to protect intermediaries against suits for damages brought by irate customersBIIBAas the trade association attempting to represent most middlemenis equally unhappy that Fimbra is attempting to bring in a centralised insurance schemeas most of BIIBA's members have their own professional indemnity insurance coverA centralised scheme would disrupt existing relationships between BIIBA members and their insurersand lose them valuable financial advantages such as a no claims bonusBIIBA wanted a stay of execution on Fimbra's plans and thought that it had gained such a deal when its chairmanDavid Palmermet Fimbra chairman Lord EltonIn those discussions BIIBA claims that it was agreed that its members would be allowed to renew their existing policies up to 31 October 1990A misunderstanding then seems to have occurred with Fimbra writing to its members last week saying that its scheme had not been altered in any way and that members could not renew existing policies if the renewal date was after 1990BIIBA's director of public affairs commentedFimbra have clearly reneged on their agreementIn view of the rumours of meetings between it and the underwriters of the Fimbra scheme it appears that the insurers are calling the shotsFor a scheme which was claimed to take independent financial advisers out of the power of insurersthis is an ironic situation for Fimbra to have got itself intoThe campaign continuesA new aroma THE International Stock Exchange started out life as a London coffee shopLast week it admitted its 400th memberthe Swedish-owned United Securities Fondkommissionthe first time that level has been reached in its 300-year historyPerhaps the ISE ought to bring out a commemorative and suitably international blendView from ManhattanAirlines fly into regulatory stormBy LARRY BLACKRE-REGULATION is the buzzword on the lips of the US airline industryas the worst excesses of the oligopoly bred by its predecessorderegulationonce again became evidentWhile the stock of yet another carrier soared on buyout speculationa fatal crash at New York's La Guardia Airportagain brought lax airline safety to public attentionAnd another bankruptcyinvolving Braniff Airlinesreminded everyone of the stranglehold the Big Eight carriers have over the domestic marketBut it was neither safetymonopoly nor dangerous debt loads that precipitated the first major intervention in the industry by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner last weekIt was national security concernsOn Fridayciting worries about foreign influence over civil aviationMr Skinner issued a consent orderon NorthWest Airlinesforcing it to reduce the involvement of KLMthe Dutch carrierin its recent buyoutEarlier his office issued a request for information to United Airlineswhose $6.8bn staff buyout is to be part-financed by $750m from British AirwaysForeign involvement in US carriersMr Skinner argued recentlycould compromise response to a national emergencyCivil aviation must have a clear commitment to Americahe saidKLM's part in the NorthWest deal falls short of the 25 per cent limit placed on foreign ownership by the Federal Aviation Act of 1958But the Dutch airline has had to agree to reduce its $400m investment in NorthWest to about $175mor about a quarter of the equity involved in the takeover being led by Los Angeles businessman Al ChecchiThe $3.65bn buyout will increase the airline's debt-equity ratio from less than 50 per cent to 585 per cent and NorthWest operates one of the oldest fleets in the industrybut Mr Skinner's chief concern was the citizenship of KLM's representative on the NorthWest boardI can't figure out why foreign investment is the battlefield he decided to pickone official said on FridayWashington's stance seems sure to complicate the United Airlines buyoutwhich was to close a few days after the 10 October deadline set by Mr Skinner for information on BA's involvementThough BA would have only 15 per cent of the voting shares in Unitedthe second-largest US airlineits investment represents almost 80 per cent of the equity in the dealUnder the apparent terms of the Transportation Secretary's new regulationsBA would have to slash its contribution by $500m probably killing the staff buyout and would effectively lose its representation on the UA boardChanging the ground rules has angered investors on both sides of the Atlanticand Mr Skinner's mandate for this is being widely questioned particularly as foreign carriers are already represented on US airline boardsBritish Department of Transport officials have expressed concern about the probable restrictions and urged an open and free investment climateThe irony of Mr Skinner's re-regulation of the airline industrysay Wall Street analystsis that it comes after the shake-out among domestic carriers has taken place and serves only to reinforce the advantages enjoyed by the surviving majorsMr Skinner's real concern is not United's loyalties in the event of an Anglo-American war but the bargaining strength of the US industry in international negotiationsBilateral treaties now regulate trans-Atlantic air trafficand 1992 has US carriers worried about their strength in future talksUS airlines not involved in partnerships complain Europe does not allow reciprocal investments in flag carriersand argue that protectionism will worsen with continental integrationUS airlines already find themselves at a disadvantage because ofopen skypolicies during Reagan-era deregulationthey sayMr Skinner in speeches decrying unparalleled levels of foreign investmenthas made references to the covenants that spell out the opportunitiesfor the airlines of each nationForeign influence over major US airlines would mean this framework would be radically alteredhe saidWhat could rescue the United Airlines deal is the nature of the buyoutUnited employees will control 75 per cent of the airline's voting stockmaking it by far the largest employee-owned corporation in the USA strong political lobby has already been mounted in Washingtonarguing United will remain a truly American assetbecause of the staff participationDemocrat Robert Byrdthe former Senate leaderhas criticised Mr Skinner's actions in the NorthWest dealand warned against interfering in UnitedUnited is also arguing that employee concessions in the deal should be considered sweat equityreducing BA's contribution to 35 per centIf BA can resell $300m of its United investment ideally to US citizens then its remaining equity share could be said to be only 21 per centairline officials in New York argueMr Skinner's action also raises the possibility of retaliation by other governmentsand of slower international liberalisation if not an outright global re-regulatory warThe US may find it fairly unfriendly when some of its carriers want to make deals

its assets are its peopleThe insurance business cycle is also at a low ebbAround a hundred of the staff have taken part in the buyoutwhich we are very pleased withIt shows they have confidence in the

between consenting adultsBy SARAH HOGGThe Chancellor is trying to convince his political audience that Britain's deficit now running at close on 4 per cent of national incomeis not a problemand to convince the markets not to sell sterlingIn both argumentsthe next two weeks which include a probable German interest-rate rise and an unavoidable Conservative Party conference will be criticalIf Mr Lawson can hold off a base rate rise at least until he can blame the Germansthat will make his political task a fraction easierbut not muchThe balance of payments is a circular identity of inflows and outflowswhich must necessarily match each otherYou can start the argument at any point on the circleViewed from one anglea current account deficit is merely the necessary counterpart of a capital account surplusand it is from this point that Nigel Lawson's defensive intellectual outworks runBritain's kind of deficit arises not because the Government needs to borrowthe public sector itself is in heavy surplusThe deficit is created by the actions of the private sectorIf so his argument goes consenting adults in the private sectors of different countries lend money to each otherall that shows is that capital markets are usefully redirecting the surplus savings of one economy to the investment opportunities in anotherThat detached observerthe International Monetary Fundcalls this kind of deficit efficient and self-correctingHistory shows it can go on for a long timeas deficits and surpluses did during the golden age before the First World WarVery recent history suggests the world has become much more like that againwith investment in each country breaking free from the constraint of domestic savingsEvidence of excessive demand There is some observable good sense in this argumentand it helps to explain why sterling has not hit the fan a lot earlierduring a truly spectacular swing from surplus to deficit over the past two yearsBut its limits are exposed by asking a simple questionwhythenshould Mr Lawson not be quite happy to see the deficit get even largerWhy should a gooddeficit not get even betterThe first reason the Chancellor gives is that there is some badfroth on the gooddeficitthat is to sayevidence of excessive domestic demandThis argument starts from a different point on the balance of payments circlewith the excess of imports over exportsEven heresomething can be found to say for the deficitas a safety valve for inflationary pressuresBut it still haswilly-nillyto be financed by attracting capital inflowsNowthis surge in demand was equally clearly created by the grown-up private sectornot by a government bingeBut here Mr Lawson does not seem to be quite so indifferent to the behaviour of consenting adultshe has been endeavouring to control their behaviour by altering the price at which they can borrowAnswer number two turns on another price that bothers himInternational borrowing nowadays takes place in a world of moving exchange ratesIn pre-1914 daysthere was a gold standardand a single world capital market centred on LondonToday there is again a global capital marketbut no gold standardno fixed exchange ratesfor Britain not even a European Monetary SystemThat is not Mr Lawson's faultof coursebut he has to live with the danger that while the world's capital markets will duly bridge the gap between Britain's domestic savings and investmentthey will only do so at a lower price for sterlingIf you take the argument about consenting adults to its logical conclusionthat price Britain's exchange rate should be left to themtooBut however suspicious Mrs Thatcher may be of managed exchange rate systemsshe dislikes a falling pound as much as anyoneSo we come back around the circle to the capital side of the balance of paymentsand the operationally interesting questionfor how long can we expect the world's savers to make up our domestic shortageMr Lawson is right to say that deficits are more sustainable than they were in the 1970sThere is indeed a world market for savingsalthough that is not a wholly comforting factthe Chancellor himself foresees a world shortage of savingswhich means everyone is going to have to compete harder iepay morefor themMeanwhilemarket operators take due account of exchange rate riskand what alarms them is not so much the sizebut the direction of a deficitOver-optimism at the Treasury Through the summerthe signs of a slowdown in domestic demand had come reasonably on cuethe inflation figures duly peakedretail sales tailed offeven labour costs did not accelerate as fast as fearedCar sales were uncomfortably largeand with them the July trade deficitbut the Treasury thought it detected more comforting underlying trendsLast week it was obliged to admityet againto over-optimismThe Chancellor is now prepared to claim no more than that the deficit is more or less flattening outNot much of a claimmore than a year after he started trying to turn the tideand one yet to be provenanywayThere are such awkward critics as Fred Bergstenof the Institute of International Economics in Washingtonwho argue that a private-sector induced deficit might actually be more tiresome than the US-style twin deficitsin public finances and the current account because however much he deprecates the latterat least it is clear what ought to be doneIt ishe arguesnot at all clear how you raise private savings to close the other kind of gapThis point should not be pushed to perversitythe IMF is still clear that a US-style deficit is worseand it certainly is not being quickly correctedBut Mr Lawson has to show he knows how to do the trickbefore he can win his argumentin theory or in the marketsCorporate ProfileFrench flair and Le Mortgage push Compagnie Bancaire aheadMichael Prest takes a look at one of Europe's most unusual and successful financial groupsBy MICHAEL PRESTBRITISH yuppies yearning for that charming little place they saw in the Dordogne last summer have probably never heard of Compagnie BancaireBut since 1988 they may well have taken out Le Mortgageoffered by the French company's British offshootUCB Groupto finance their terrain gastronomiqueIn so doingthey will have added their mite to the expansion of one of Europe's most unusual and successful financial groupsLe Mortgage offers fixed-rate sterling finance to Britons wanting to buy second homes in FranceCB takes care of the notaire who is the dread of British buyers of French propertyIt is a tiny part of CB's businessBut in several ways it illustrates the group's strengthssize combined with flaira strong French base from which to develop business abroadand a flexible structureCB is certainly successfulConsolidated net operating income has risen from FFr880m £86.3min 1984 to FFr1.34bn last yearOver the same period new business almost doubled to FFr68.4bntotal loans and other financings grew from FFr94.3bn to FFr146bnand savings managed jumped from FFr6.3bn to FFr29.9bnIn 1988 the group had 8,000 employeesof whom 500 were outside FranceMore importantperhapsCB is an unusual organisationAs a massive lender which takes no depositsa marketer of industrial and consumer financeand increasingly a purveyor of insurance-related products to an under-insured French publicCB probably embodies a unique combination of strategy and interestsThere is definitely no parallel in BritainCB originated in the ruins of France one year after the end of the Second World War as Union Financiere d'Enterprises Francaises et EtrangeresIts founderJacques de Fouchieris still closely associated with the group as Chairman Emeritus itself an unsual idea of the supervisory boardIn the early yearsthe company was involved mainly in financing imports of raw materials and factory equipmentand its chief shareholders were the leading French banksSince then two related developments have given the group its unusual characterOne development was a network of stakes in the principal companies in each type of businessFour of these companies are quoted separately from CB on the Paris Bourse CB received a London listing in 1973UCB 33 per cent owned by CBin housing and property financeUFB Locabail 66.2 per centbusiness equipment financeCetelem 67.7 per cent consumer financeand Cardif 56 per cent life insurance and savings productsThe man who runs the group is 51-year-old Andre Levy-LangHe is the engaging chairman of CB's management boardwhose education at the Ecole Polytechnique and doctorate from Stanford University create an aura of international competence one meets too rarely in British companiesHe explained that the structure evolved because the group needed equity to finance growthSeveral of the quoted subsidiaries and associates also control other businessesfor example Solvega property portfolio management companyin which several CB group companies have stakesThis structure is typical of the continentalas distinct from the Britishfirmthe holding groupparticularly the bank holding groupstems from equity involvement in industryan involvement shunned by British banksAt the same timeCBas it became in 1959has seen the source of its earnings diversify as consumer finance became more and more important to the groupLoans made in 1979 totalled FFr59.1mof which property accounted for FFr40m and consumer finance accounted for FFr9.29mor 15.7 per cent of the totalBy 1988howeverthe picture had changed dramaticallyConsumer finance contributed FFr40mor a quarterto all loans that year of FFr147mwhile property made up FFr75.1m of the totalThe tell-tale sign was that at FFr29.5mconsumer finance was easily the biggest component in new lending last yearIn the early 1980snew lending was roughly the same in consumer finance as in housing and property financeAnother simultaneous change of long-term importance to CB is the growth of overseas businessThe total of loans and other financings to customers outside France has gone up from FFr28m in 1981 to FFr10.7m last yearMr Levy-Lang said that this year a quarter of new lending will have been outside Franceand 90 per cent of that will have been in the United KingdomCB already claims 2 per cent of the British fixed-rate mortgage marketMr Levy-Lang is casual about CB's expansionThe move into consumer financehe saidwas chiefly caused by restrictions on lendingthe corsetto other areasRegulation made us do thathe saidCBhe claimedhad in mind no particular balance between its componentsWe have no ratio in the mix of businessWe want to grow as fast as we canBut there are disciplinesThe key objective is a 15 per cent return on equityand all business within the group is conducted at arm's length on guidelines laid down by CB at the centreMr Levy-Lang saidIt is a financial discipline in a wayWe can't do anything we want within the groupThere is also a shrewd understanding of what consumers wantWith a wry smileMr Levy-Lang observedI have a great belief in the rationality of consumersThey are very intelligent economistsall of themHe acknowledges that as a resultthe consumer finance and investment markets are very competitivenot least in France where savers now have more faith in moneyas distinct from assetsand the big banks are muscling inOne solution for CBaccording to Mr Levy-Langis attention to detailWe approach every problem as a specific problemIt is what makes us different from the commercial banksYou have to offer specific services to specific peopleDespite its rate of return targetthe average between 1984 and 1988 was 12.7 per centslipping to 12.4 per cent last yearSeveral factors are inhibiting growth of earningsa weaker domestic loan markettighter interest rate marginsand slow growth by some subsidiariesThe latter is within CB's competence to remedyCardifthe insurance companyand Cortalthe asset management division of CBhave both grown too slowly recently for the group's tasteCB is also trying to substitute floating rate for fixed rate mortgages in FranceThese problems will take a while to sort outCB is also most unlikely to reach its ambitious goal of generating half its earnings outside France by 1992despite having started 20 new businesses in Europe over the last few yearsMr Levy-Lang is characteristically disingenuous about the talismanic date of 1992It led us to speed it uphe saidwhile denying that the alleged single market would of itself promote businessBlessed with tight and impressive managementhoweverand its firm French baseCB's long-term growth seems assuredwhatever the specific problemsAnd there will be no difficulty in following eventsThe group's financial yearbookbeautifully produced in Englishis as comprehensive as the most demanding analyst could wishPerhaps

International Coffee Organisation meeting -how do they pass a week without a visible resultI thought it appropriate to think about teaIt is not such a perverse ideabecause a lot of people have recently become interested in that noble beverageAs alwaysthe interest is not unconnected with a little matter of priceAt last Monday's weekly London tea auctionprices reached their highest for three yearsMany in the trade expect prices to go up further todayand possibly for quite a few auctions to comeRichard Howell of Sheppardsthe London stockbrokershas been following tea and plantation shares for 20 yearsMy anticipation is that we will certainly see a rise on Monday not of the same proportionbut there's clearly going to be a riseWhat's developed in 1989 is a genuine shortage of teas of all gradesOver the past 12 months the price of lower medium quality teawhich is the main ingredient in the British cuppa and imparts that unique lorry-driver flavourhas almost doubled from 78p a kilogramme to 135pMedium qualities have also risen noticeablyfrom 98p to 145pover the same periodBut quality teasthe best gradehave hardly changed at around 200p a kilogrammeThe rise is particularly interesting because it confounded expectationsThe Economist Intelligence Unit concluded in its World Commodity Outlook 1989Short of climatic intervention to which tea is less vulnerable than most other major crops a continuation of the downtrend seems unavoidablewe expect London auction prices to average £1/kgor even lessin 1989At the beginning of the yearhoweverthe trend argument was much more plausible than it is todayWorld production of tea black and greengrew from 2.27m tonnes in 1985 to 2.34m tonnes in 1987and rose again in 1988Whereasaccording to the United States Department of

estatesExports from that lovely island could be 40 per cent lower in 1989 than in 1988Since Sri Lanka previously exported about 200,000 tonnes of tea annuallyonly a little less than Indiathe biggest exporterthe loss is crucialSecondthere was a climatic disasterMalawiwhich exports normally about 40,000 tonnes a yearhas suffered from a serious droughtOnly a good crop in Kenya has saved Africa from another disasterThirdIndian exports have been depressed by a combination of politics and natureThe political factor is the imminent general electionFearful of the consequences of higher tea pricesthe government has sought to stabilise them by fiddling the weekly Calcutta auctionsIn alternate weeks the auction is wholly devoted to domestic buyers or to foreign buyersSince the bulk of the tea at the Calcutta auctions is low medium qualitythe dual auction has a disproportionate impact on tea prices generallyand on London prices especiallyThis effect has been compounded by the natural factora disappointing crop in southern IndiaThere are other elements in the price rise as wellAt the end of last yearagain largely for political reasonsthe Pakistan government granted licences to importers to bring in teaPakistan is now a net tea importerIn a different and much more alarming category is the fate of the Soviet industryThe Soviet Union used to produce about 150,000 tonnes of tea a yearmaking it one of the biggest growersBut nuclear power changed thatAccording to Mr Howellall the bushes in Georgia were polluted by radiationand have been destroyedFor the first time that anyone can rememberthe Soviet Union has been buying at the London auctionMr Howell is convinced that the tea market under-supplied for several yearsThis genuine shortage is occurring for the first time everThis is the great genuine move in the tea priceThere is evidence to support the case that prices will remain high for a whileDespite the withdrawal of the Indian army from Sri Lankapeace may not be establishedEven if it issome estates could take years to rehabilitateA tea bush requires constant attentionif not plucked for a year it can take two years to return to normalif bushes have to be uprootednew ones take seven years to come into productionDespite the relative growth of consumption and demand in the mid-1980sthe market for black tea alone was finely balanced at around 1.67m tonnesMoreoverthe four biggest growers and exporters IndiaSri LankaChina and Kenya also have large populations and or high birth ratesAs the Indian example showsdomestic consumption is a vital factorYet one must be cautiousHistorically tea has been a fairly dull marketdominated by trade interests two arguments against the London Fox's efforts to excite interest in a tea futures contractA balanced marketby definitioncan swing surprisingly fast in the opposite directionthe chances arefor examplethat Malawi will not have a drought next yearBut for all I knowthe ICO could still be meeting thenInternational Capital MarketsAccountants face hard task in search for global harmonyBy DAVID FRANKYESTERDAY was the last day for comments from the public on a paper issued in January entitledComparability of Financial Statementspublished by the International Accounting Standards CommitteeThis is hardly the sort of catchy title guaranteed to get most of us rushing to our desks in search of pen and papernor is it easy to imagine squeezing into packed village halls to listen to speeches demanding a rewrite of the rules on deferred taxationIn acknowledgement of thisIASCwhich comprises the leading world accounting bodiessent out a separate invitation to interested parties asking for their views on the subjectIt called thisTowards the International Harmonisation of Financial StatementsHarmonising international accounting standards is more important than one might thinkIn today's marketswhere increasingly companies are looking to raise funds beyond their own national bordersagreement on an objective standard for measuring the financial health of a business is vitalThe world's top securities market regulatorswho met recently in Venicecited the need to reconcile financial statements to local accounting standards as a significant factor in any company's decision on which markets to target or not for an international offering of new sharesThe lack of accounting harmonisationparticularly between the US and the UKis seen by many bankers as the key issue in the development of the Euro-equity marketwhere new issues of shares are offered in more than one country simultaneouslyTwo examples highlight the problemsWhen British Telecom was privatisedshares were issued both in the US and the UK and other jurisdictionsBT's registration statement for the US showed that net incomeand shareholdersequity' under UK generally accepted accounting principles Gaapwere each double the US Gaap figures and retained earnings were three times the US Gaap equivalentWhen BP made its disastrous privatisation offering at the time of the crashits profit forecast for the year ending 31 December1987computed in accordance with UK Gaapwas £1.45bn whereas its forecast based on US Gaap was 25 per cent lower at £1.1bnBoth forecasts were included in the US and Canadian prospectusesThe UK prospectushowevercontained only the UK Gaap computed forecastThe problem IASCand the market regulators' body Ioscofaces though is determining how harmonisation can be brought aboutEveryone might agree that financial statements should be based on the same standard but the inevitable follow up comment isYesoursAccording to bankers active in the Euro-equity market this cry is heard most frequently from US accountancy firms which believe their standardsbeing the most conservativeprovide the safest blueprintWithout the support of the Americansharmonisation seems a distant idealAnd yet applying US standards in this country for examplecould require a massive downward restatement of corporate profits and net worthwhich would be resisted fiercelyWhat some experts would like to see is a system of reciprocity whereby companies could make international equity offerings using their home market accounting standards without the need to reconcile their financial statements to the standards of each jurisdiction in which shares are offeredThis probably provides the best way forwardnot least because of the major markets only the USItaly and Canada explicitly require foreign companies to restate their figures according to local standardsThe UK by contrast requires only that figures are prepared and audited to internationally acceptable standards but not necessarily UK GaapIf the US could be persuaded to take a similar linemany of the problems for companies contemplating an international issue would disappearThe Eurobond market is on course for a record year after registering a volume of $165bn for the first nine months according to Euromoney BondwareAt this rate 1989 volume should comfortably surpass 1986's record figure of $179bnand may yet reach the magic $200bn40% of shareholders approve Ferranti demerger planBy MARY FAGANTechnology

would have to write off £185mFerranti is now convinced that it was the victim of fraud perpetrated by International Signal and Control which it took over two years agoA report by Coopers & Lybrand into suspect ISC contracts and the nature and extent of any fraud is expected to be delivered to Ferranti today or tomorrowFerranti then hopes to decide on a course of action and in particular on how to restructure its capital baseIt has already undertaken to sell off £100m worth of businesses and to raise £150m through a rights issue or by attracting a suitorSir Derek said last night that he had glancedat the Hill Samuel plan and was interested to see how it works outBut he stressedIt's only an ideanot a proposaland it needs a lot more workThe Hill Samuel plan envisages splitting off the UK

defence interests are up for saleA successful merger could create a defence company with estimated sales of £800mFerranti's naval and avionics businesses are thought to have a turnover of about £500mAccording to Mr BakerThorn's ground-based radar activities would dovetail with Ferranti's airborne radar and result in a formidable force in European defence electronicsFerranti's annual

Nigel Lawson battles against continuing pressure to lift base lending ratesAnalysts expect the pound to come under renewed pressure in the run-up to Thursday's Bundesbank meetingwhich will decide whether and by how much to raise West Germany's key Lombard interest rateThe markets have already fully-discounted a half-point rise in the German rate to 7.5 per centHowevera full one-point rise would probably trigger another run on sterling and force a one-point base rate rise in the UKThe Government has signalled its determination to resist raising the 14 per cent base rate during the politically-sensitive fortnight of the Labour and Conservative party conferencesAccording to Bill Martineconomist at UBS-Phillips & DrewThe only thing the Chancellor fears more than the currency speculators are the rows of blue rinses at Blackpool next weekBuilding societies would respond to a base rate increase with a hike in their mortgage ratesA one-point rise in the mortgage rate to 14.5

since it controls one third of the Australian life insurance market its opportunities were limited in that countryEarlier this year AMP acquired London Lifethe mutual British life insurerfor just £15m

publishing businessEarlier this yearThorn EMI paid £187m to US-based SBK for a large catalogue of songsand subsequently also bought a half share in Chrysalis Records in the UKSince thenPolygram has bought Island Records and has anounced the takeover of A&M recordsBoth Virgin and Thorn EMI are thought to be vying for the lucrative Jobete in Detroitwhich controls the publishing rights to a catalogue of 15,000 Motown titlesThe decision to look for a significant equity partner appears to be Virgin's attempt to keep out of the clutches of the five majors while remaining a credible force in
