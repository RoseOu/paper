Ripping yarns and moral minefieldsAllan and Janet Ahlberg talk to Celia Dodd about their bestsellers for childrenBy CELIA DODDTHESE daysno one questions the importance of good books for the under-fivesBut books that appeal to adults too are just as importantwe areafter allthe ones who have to do the readingThere are few things worse than being bludgeoned into reading a book you hateStory-reading should be one of the great joys of parenthooda real meeting of adult and child mindsWith the Ahlbergs' booksit very often isThe husband-and-wife partnership behind such classics as The Jolly PostmanBurglar Bill and The Baby's Catalogue win children over with ripping yarns and a wicked sense of humourThey win their parents over with a rose-tinted vision of the world which is decidedly reassuringTheir books are usually set nostalgically in the past the Thirties and Forties are favourite periods and often feature the perennial characters of fairy tales and nursery rhymesYet they are saved from sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and picturesThe Ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the harsh realities of lifeof being too cosy and sweetbut their latest picture bookBye Bye Babypublished todaybreaks the mouldIn ita small child roams the streetstalking to strangersuntil he finally goes off with a woman who has been wandering about pushing an empty pramCurious subject matter for a children's picture bookyou might thinkand hardly guaranteed to win the approval of the gimlet-eyed children's book worldBut the Ahlbergs have no time for literal interpretations of their workHowthey arguewould Aliceor The Wind in the Willowsstand up against such scrutinyThe way to look at Bye Bye Babythey insistis as a lightsurreal comedyCertainly if you bring a literal interpretation to the storyit's a minefieldAllan Ahlberg saysBye Bye Baby gets away with its particular minefield thanks to the sleight of illustrator Janet Ahlberg's handThe visual inspiration for the book was the famous advert for Start-rite shoesshowing a small boy and girl walking off down a tree-lined avenue an innocent image if ever there was oneThe Ahlberg version features a solitary figureThe advert gave the story its vaguely Thirties settingThe success of the Ahlbergs' working relationship must have a lot to do with their long and happy marriageIn spite of apparently incompatible personalities she is small and shyhe is large and does most of the talking they have an empathy which is essential to the way they worka persistent mutual pesteringThe strength of the partnership is highlighted for Allanwho also works with a number of other artistsThe time-consuming nature of Janet's part in the processcombined with a bad back which prevents her spending more than a couple of hours at the drawing board every daymeans she cannot keep up with her husband's prolific outputWith other illustratorsI work at a distance we visit and phonebut there is a point at which I can't pester them any moreAllan saysThey see themselves not as author and illustratorwith separate rolesbut as a partnership of book-makerscontributing equally to the processAllan Ahlberg saysIn the pasta lot of children's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked brilliant framed in a gallerybut when you tried to read the bookthere was nothing therebecause the words started as a coat-hanger to hang pictures onGiven the importance they place on the interrelationship of words and picturesthe couple's working lives are surprisingly separateThey claim to see each other less than couples who go out to workmeeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchenTheir 10-year-old daughterJessicawho is likely to be seen with her head buried in The Beano or a Roald Dahl novelhas provided the inspiration for many of her parents' booksAs a babyshe was fascinated by the Mothercare Catalogueand so The Baby's Cataloguewhich documents the paraphernalia of the infant's small world in minute detailwas bornAllan's experience as a primary school teacher is another rich source of ideasThe couple still maintain close links with local schoolswhere they spend hours researchingsketching and absorbing jokesAfter 10 years of teaching Allan had had enoughI ran out of steamIt's a killing jobLittle kids eat you alivethey want so much physically and emotionallyEvery year he would have half a dozen nine- and 10-year-olds in his class who could barely readHe treated reading as a team effortgetting them to read the Daily Mirror rather than the dullbabyish books on offerThese dayshe writes the books intended to help children learn to readA lot of books used in schools are technically readable but rather drab storiesThere's no reason why they shouldn't be funny or gripping even if they don't use many wordsWriting books for children is becoming increasingly complexas the arbiters of the modern child's mores librariansteachers and publishers lay down ever more stringent criteriaThe problem with children's books increasingly is that there are armies of people who are properly concerned withfor examplethe way girls were always discriminated against in the pastsays AllanThat is badand must be thought aboutBut people seem to think that stories are written to a prescriptionthat you sit down and sayyou don't want it to be sexistyou don't want it to be racistIn reality you just invent a taleas if you were sitting round a fire in a caveIn fact anti-racism and anti-sexism seem to come naturally to the AhlbergsTheir books are full of female breadwinners and New Men changing nappies and comforting bawling babies in the small hoursAlthough they are a principled pair they once turned down the Smarties Award on moral grounds the Ahlbergs reject the notion of children's author as moralistI would sayjust sit down and tell a good storyand to hell with the moralityAllan Ahlberg declaresWith that characteristically strong statementhe puts his finger on the secret of the Ahlbergs' phenomenal success with adults and children alikeA manifesto for fashion from an idea by LeninHelen Womack on the stylish clothes being inspired by communism's iconsBy HELEN WOMACKRUSSIANS are numb to the red of the Communist Party and the face of Lenin which has stared at them in public places for decadesNot surprisinglythey

imaginationYelena Khudiakova's exhibition of high fashion using imagery from behind the Iron Curtain' opens at the Birch and Conran gallery in London's Soho todayMs Khudiakova herself mayfrom time to time during the week of the showmodel some of the 20 outfits a red silk skirt patterned with the heads of workers who look as if they are marching when you walk in ita red evening dress decorated with a swath of flowers reminiscent of the relief on a pavilion in Moscow's Stalin-era Exhibition of Economic AchievementsThe latter dress shows something of the influence of her education at the Moscow Institute of Architecture in the early EightiesWe studied sculpturegraphics and composition as well as architectureIt was a good grounding for an artistOpportunities to be creative as an architect are limitedso many look for other artistic challengesshe explainedBut her main inspiration is the post-revolutionary school of constructivist artHer idol is the 1920s artist Varvara Stepanovawhose clothes designs she has reconstructed for museums and whose portraitalong with that of the revolutionary poet Mayakovskyshe has stitched on to another of her own red dressesDeveloping the constructivist styleMs Khudiakova31has created straight cotton dresses with cog-wheel patterns in primary coloursShe has also designed black-and-white striped or chequered dressesinspired by the shadows and dramatic diagonals in Eisenstein's filmsShe modelled these under the chandeliers in the grand marble foyer of one of the seven Stalin-gothic skyscrapers in Moscowwhich she describes as a perfect example of Soviet pokazukha window-dressingThe outside of the building is splendidbut the flats inside are crampedWhy is she fascinated by a style perfected under a dictator whose crimes the Soviet people are just beginning to understandI know it is sometimes ugly and has bad political connotationsBut it is specialYou won't find it anywhere else in the world the Moscow metro or the boards of honour hoardings where photos of model workers are displayedI'm trying to make it more beautiful and transform it into the language of clothesIdeology is one thingbut it is possible to enjoy a visual impression without thinking of historyArt is higher than politicsShe is not a member of the Communist PartyA sense of humour redeems her designs from some of their associationsFashion is extravagantYou should enjoy yourselfThis is not satirebut there is an element of a jokeShe indicates a necklace made up of military insignia to illustrate her pointOne can imagine a Soviet general
