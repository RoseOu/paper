A Country DiaryNORTHUMBERLANDRoe deer are among the most difficult wild creatures for humans to succour and rehabilitateAbandoned fawns have been reared on a bottleonly to die within a few monthsSo it was interesting to hear this week from Mrs Bolton of Wildlife In Need in the north of our country that she has recently saved the life of a six-month old roe doe fawnThe little deer was seen staggering in a distressed and bloated conditioncaptured with difficulty and taken to a vet who pumped fermented corn from the stomach presumably the fawn had gorged herself on pheasant feedMrs Bolton kept her in a pen wheredespite remaining in a very frightened statethe little beast recovered and started eating small amounts of hayAfter three dayswhen scouring had stoppedshe was taggedput in a sack and taken to a field which a neighbour was certain her siblings frequentedIt was wonderful to see her reactionsaid Mr BoltonShe shot up the field and then pausedstood her ground although we were still quite close and suddenly began to eat grassShe knew that she had come homeA few days later the doe was seen in the company of her mother and twin sisterAt present an agoraphobic shag is languishing at the wildlife centre anddespite every inducementMrs Bolton cannot persuade him even to get his feet wetShe has five hedgehogs hibernating in mounds of leaves and a kestrel which was left on her doorstep with a damaged footIt has been a bad autumn for birds of prey and five kestrels have been brought into the sanctuary in an emaciated conditionWorms are a staple diet and these have been in short supply due to the summer droughtVERONICA HEATHDivers dangers The dramatic rise in diving's popularity has led to fears for the safety of people new to the sportJohn Illman reportsTHE spectacular beauty of coral is attracting an ever increasing number of people to scuba divingMany Britons undergo training in the UK after trying the sport abroad and then continue diving in our colder UK watersThe British Sub Aqua Club BSAChas just reported a record-breaking yearwith the number of dives off the UK coast estimated at about two million 100 per cent up on the previous yearBut medical diving experts are concerned that many newcomers to the sport are diving too deepespecially in the UKexposing themselves to life-threatening injury from the bendsor decompression sicknessWriting in Diver MagazineBSAC's incidents adviserChris AllenwarnsThe statistics show that too many divers are still diving deeper than indicated by their abilitiesignoring commonsense recommendations or simply failing to plan their dives properlyThe longer a diver remains under water and the greater the depththe more nitrogen is absorbedWhen pressure is reduced during ascentthis nitrogen must be slowly eliminated through breathingor bubbles will form in the bloodstreamgiving rise to the bendsA diver absorbing excessive nitrogen must ascend to a designated depth to reduce the pressure and remain there for a specified time for what is known as a decompression stopBut Allen warnsA number of cases of decompression sickness have resulted after required decompression stops have been missed due to divers running out of air towards the end of their divesSome are diving to 50 metres or moreSurgeon Commander James Francissenior medical officer diving medicineat the Institute of Naval MedicinesaysI would have thought that 30 metres was a reasonable depth for most sports diversBelow that your bottom timethe time between leaving the surface and commencing your ascent is so limited that it's hardly worthwhileDespite the dangersBSACwhose training is among the most rigorous in the worldinsists that diving compares favourably with other sportsThis year there were 12 fatalities linked to divingBSAC spokesman Kendal McDonald claims that this compares with the 35 fatalities a year associated with angling39 with boatingand 44 with swimmingThe club is pressing for recognition of decompression sickness as an NHS liabilityMany health authorities have been refusing to pay for treatmentarguing that divers should take out decompression insuranceTreatment can cost anything from a few hundred pounds to up to Â£15,000 in exceptional circumstancesBSAC medical officer Dr Peter Wilmhurstof St Thomas' HospitalLondonsaysDivers are entitled to treatment under the NHS Act in the same way as a skater who breaks a leg on the ice or a rider who breaks his back falling off a horseIt would be a false economy not to treat diversIf you have a diver with spinal bendand you don't recompress themyou have someone paralysed from the waist downThe cost to society of treating them is immenseDepth of experiencetyros must avoid going down too far OVERNIGHT FILE
