Another disturbing chapter in the history of the DTI NotebookBy Alex BrummerTHERE will be those who portray the report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration on the Barlow Clowes Affair as a triumph for the British system of financial regulationYesof coursethey will saythere is clear evidence that the Department of Trade and Industry fouled up badly maladministration as the Ombudsman likes to call itBut what is really importantit will be arguedis that the system triumphedAs a result of the Ombudsman's vigorous and admirably speedy deliberationsthe hapless 18,000 investors who put their faith in the DTI imprimatur will be fully compensated and the integrity of the UK's investment apparatus has been preservedMoreoverif there was maladministration it is of little consequence now in that the new regime established by the Financial Services Act of 1986 has rendered the DTI's role in this matter redundantSuch muddled thinking partly explains the complacency of the Corporate and Consumer Affairs MinisterMr John Redwoodwho accepted the findings without prejudiceThis cool response almost certainly reflects legal cautionbut also a bland faith in the regulatory systemEven before the report went to the printersthe OmbudsmanSir Anthony Barrawcloughwas told by the DTI's most senior officer that it intended to give its own viewin a separate documenton the responsibilities of regulatorsThis is the kind of self-righteous behaviour at which Mrs Thatcher's Government excelsThe DTI's record in regulatory matters is not an honourable oneFew drivers who bought car insurance policies from Dr Emil Savundra's Fire Auto & Marine in the mid-1960s will forget the culpability of then Board of TradeNor will those investors and depositors who in the mid-1970s found themselves caught in a hurricane sweeping throught the secondary banking system after the collapse of Gerald Caplan's London and County SecuritiesSuffice it to say that the DTI was the supervising authority for such fringe banksMore recently its inconsistent behaviour over the publication of DTI reports into important City scandals has also raised questions of judgmentundue political influence and its due care to the public interestTiny Rowland may have become a bore with his obsession over DTI's failure to publish the report on the House of Fraser but on this occasion he is on the side of the GodsThere can be no sense in the DTI's refusal to publish the House of Fraser report on the grounds that it might prejudice a Serious Fraud Office inquiry when it took the opposite course over Blue ArrowAnd while one is busy throwing the rotten eggswho can forget the duplicity of the DTI over the disposal of Rover to British AerospaceIt would be nice to write that despite these lapses of judgmentnot to mention the occasional maladministrationinvestors and other stakeholders in business do not have to worry because of the safety superstructure which has been built sinceBut there is little in the current regulatory structure which is designed to inspire the confidence of investorsIndeedeven if supervision of Barlow Clowes had passed seamlessly from the DTI to the Financial IntermediariesManagers and Brokers Regulatory Association FIMBRAthere can be no guarantee the warning signs at Barlow Clowesfrom intermingled funds to accounting inconsistencieswould have been unearthedWith its unwieldly band of almost 8,200 members FIMBRA is an organisation in serious distressIt is engaged in internecine warfare over the general provision of indemnity insurance for investorsBut this disputewhich has seen FIMBRA's Lord Elton off the fieldis evidence of systemic problemThe organisationconcerned with financial probityis continuously in debt because its members refuse to pay the bill for self-regulationMoreoverits attempts to weed out the next Barlow Clowes are not considered impressiveWhen suspending members for alleged wrongdoing it tends to act in the dark of nightrefusing generally to explain its actionsFIMBRA's incontinence is evidence of a system of self-regulation under stressWith the populous FIMBRA offshoot of the Securities & Investment Board SIBbucking against the post-Financial Services Act regimethe whole concept of self-regulatory organisations is brought into questionThe Stock Exchangefor instancehas been remarkably successful in doing its own policing witness the quick action taken in the case of the alleged share ramp at Williams HoldingsBut in contrastthe DTI has not been notably successful in bringing prosecutions against insiders based on the dossiers provided as the Geoffrey Collier case demonstratesEven the SIB itself appears to be having self-doubts about the unwieldly monster it has createdparticularly at a time when the City's self-regulation will have to be grafted on a more legalistic European Community frameworkThe most interesting observations by the Ombudsman in the Barlow Clowes report concern the DTI's vision of regulationIt points out that the licensing functions were lowly regarded and observes that protection of investors by definition requires a rigorous and inquiring approachSuch comments about the DTI's effectiveness as a corporate policeman could have been made almost at any time over the last 30 years and in a multitude of casesSimilarlysuccessive attempts by the City to regulate itself haveas in the case of FIMBRAended in disappointmentIt is easy to forgetfor instancethat the Bank of England is still nursing along the remains of that 1970s darlingSlater-WalkerFinancial shenanigans clearly will not be eliminated by neweven tougher legislation to protect investorsThere is more than enough statutory law aroundWhat is needed are effective regulators and that is the common thread which runs from John Bloom and Bernie Cornfeld to Peter Clowes and GuinnessInvestors deserve a strongersimpler and more tenacious system of enforcement than self-regulation can provideIt is up to government to finance and provide it but as far from the DTI as possibleBond tells shareholders his empire will surviveBy Jan Mayman in Perth and City

into the business wound up by the High CourtShares jump as financial discussions get underway Saga family in bid to go privateBy Mark MilnerSAGAthe tour operator for the over sixtiesmay soon follow in the footsteps of the likes of International Leisure Group and Richard Branson's Virgin Group by going privateThe De Haan familywhich owns 63 per cent of the travel to financial services companysaid it was considering an offer to buy the remainder of the shares at about £3 eachAt that price the whole companywhich came to the stock market 11 years agowould be valued at just over £54millionSaga shares jumped 66p to 293p after news of the approachA bid would be subject to the family raising the £20million needed to finance the purchase of the shares it does not already ownbut Mr Roger De Haanwho is leading the bid approachsaid discussions were already under way with a bank and he was confident the money would be availableMr De Haanwho is also chairman of Sagasaid the group could not enjoy one of the most important advantages of being publicly quoted using its shares to fund acquisitions because the family was determined not to dilute its controlling interestThe company was founded by Mr De Haan's father and two of his brothers also work for the groupWe built it upit is our babyhe saidadding that if the family allowed its interest to fall below 50 per cent it would risk being taken over by a hostile bidderWe just don't want to be in that positionAs a result we have not been able to take advantage of what the City has to offerOn the other handhoweverMr De Haan said the company had to put up with what it regarded as disadvantages of being publicly quotedThere were occasionsfor examplewhen the board felt a conflict between the need to distribute profits to meet the short term aspirations of the City and making medium and longer term investments in the businessWe think it would be better as a private companywithout that pressuresaid Mr De Haanthough he said the move did not reflect any disenchantment with the CityMr De Haan said the original reason for going public was his father's concern that as a private companywith no market in its sharesthe family might one day be faced with the prospect of having to sell the entire business to meet death dutiesThe group got underway as a holiday company when Mr De Haan seniorwho owned a Folkstone hotelbegan arranging holidays for pensioners in the off seasonSince then it has widened its scope considerablywith packages ranging from the traditional fortnight at an English seaside resort to treks through the Himalayas and month-long tours in South AmericaIt is believed to sell about 250,000 holidays a yearIn recent years it has added to the services it provides for the retired to include financial servicesretirement homes and magazine publishingIn the six months to the end of July the group made a profit of £1.18million 4.4 per cent down on the same period last yearSaga has about 1,500 shareholderswith institutions accounts for around half the shares not held by the family and the remainder held by private investorsMr De Haan said a £3 a share offer would represent a 25 per cent compound annual growth for investors who had bought shares when the company first came to the stock marketWe believe it is a fair and generous priceThe three independent directors on the Saga board said last night that they had noted the possible offeradding that discussions are at an early stageand a further announcement would be made as soon as practicableIn the meantime shareholders were advised not to take any actionAn end to 19 months of tormentBy Daniel JohnDELIGHTelation and relief greeted the news of the government's decision to compensate investors for the bulk of the losses they had suffered in the collapse of Barlow ClowesFor George Tyson and his wifeRosieit meant the release from a tormenting 19 months which saw their £15,000 savings put at riskI had given it up as lostsaid Mr Tysonwho lives in South RuislipMiddlesexWe have lost money but at least we have got the bulk of it backAt the same timeI'm elated and I can go back to the vices I did havesaid Mr TysonThe 68-year-old former Clerk of Works at Harrow Council in London does not smokedrink or gamble and has suffered two heart attacksI can go back to trout fishing with impunityThe Tysons should receive about £13,000 from the governmentwhich will now be invested in a building society for him and his wife and their grandchildrenFor Betty and Trevor Lee of StevenageHertfordshireyesterday's decision should see them recoup just over £10,000 out of the £12,000 investment in Barlow Clowes InternationalBefore the government's retreattheir hopes were lowMy husband said that if we got 50 per cent back it would be something but this is very good newssaid Mrs LeeAnd there was praise for the Barlow Clowes Investors Groupwhichwith Manchester solicitors Alexander Tathamwere at the forefront of the battle for compensationI don't think they could have done any more than they didThey all worked very hardRetired teacher Mary Simmonds of BlackwoodGwentgreeted the news with much reliefI'm pleased but it's not compensation for all of the trauma we have suffered or the money we have lost if we had invested it elsewhereBut we should be grateful for small merciesShe had £8,000 in the Gibraltar funda substantial slice of which was providing her with a monthly incomeI've had to be veryvery careful and say you can't afford itAs for the futureshe said she wouldn't speculate again but quickly corrected herselfI didn't think I was speculatingshe said in a rebuke to the Government's attitude towards the advertised high-returnlow-risk investment offered by Barlow ClowesIt was the same and supposedly safehaven which attracted former TV director Ray Elton from Belsize ParkLondonto put £96,000 into BCIAlong with 252 other investorshe is included in the £50,000-to-£100,000 category who the DTI says will get 80 per cent of their money backBut while pleasedMr Elton was scathing about Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley's response to the Ombudsman's report to which the Government refused to accept responsibility for the affairIt is an enormous relief but I think they have been very cleverThe fixing of the amounts of compensation made it very difficult for the investors to refuse and it was aimed at defending the DTI from outright criticism as well as preventing public uproarhe saidIt is enough to prevent us taking them the courtAs for the investors' representativesbusinessman John Dyer and his committee at BCIG and Antony Gold and David Pine at Alexander Tatham yesterday represented almost the end of a daily nightmareHaving lived with it for 19 monthsJohn Dyeran unlikely champion of investors' rights and one of the few fortunatesnot hit hard by the collapsewas fulsome in his praise for BCIG's supportersThey have made the best of a bad situationAntony Gold described the compensation proposals as excellentparticularly for BCI investors who could have been left out in the coldSatisfaction was also expressed by Michael Jordan at Cork Gully and Nigel Hamilton at Ernst & Youngthe joint liquidators of the two fundswho have so far recovered £60 million of the £190 million but knew from the beginning that anything like the Government pay-out for BCI was impossibleAnd last nightIan Burtonthe solicitor representing Peter Clowesthe former head of the collapsed investment businesssummed up his client's feelingsHe has all along been very concernedirrespective of what people have said about himabout the plight of the investorsHe only hopes compensation will be sorted out as soon as possibleThe day thrift turned into a nightmareBy Daniel JohnGEORGE Tyson is not a gambling man nor does he take unnecessary risksHe doesn't smoke or drinkand even if he wanted totwo heart attacks and a by-pass operation have made the decision for himBy his own accountMr Tyson is thrifty and states quite proudly that neither he or his wife Rosie are a burden on any form of social or government supportBut that is whyat the age of 68Mr Tyson is not enjoying what he had hoped would be a comfortable retirementA life of saving hadby 1985given them a small nest-egg of £15,000 on which the interest would help supplement their pensionsTo the Tysonsthat meant nothing extravagant just an extra £135 a month to make life at home in South RuislipMiddlesex easierThat money was invested as might be expected of the TysonsAnd for three yearsit earned its returnevery monthUntil one morning in June 1988 when George Tyson turned on the radio to hear a smallinvestment business called Barlow Clowes had collapsedIt was about 8.30am and I was just getting dressed when it came over on the newssaid Mr Tysona former clerk of works at Harrow councilLondonInvestors in Barlow Clowes since 1985the Tysons had orginally put £10,000 into the UK fund and £5,000 in Gibraltar-based Barlow Clowes International BCIFate determined that a short while before the businesses failedthey transferred the £10,000 to BCI because of the better returns being offeredIn the days that followedthe Tysons found that they and 18,000 other investors had been the victims of a financial crash of global proportionsOf the £190million invested in both fundsBCI investors faced a shortfall of up to £100millionAfter the initial shock and disbeliefthe Tysons grew angry at the advisers who convinced them about Barlow Clowesat the Midland bank manager who gave verbal assurances of its securityat the regulatory authorities responsible for the investment community and at the Department of Trade and Industry which allowed the company to tradeI felt it was so safethey were so professionalsaid Mr TysonI feel appalled by the way these professional guardians have treated usIf you were a gambling man it would not affect youit would just be lostBut this was not a gambleLike so many investorsMr Tyson found himself having to go back to work to ease the financial strain he had hoped to avoidIronicallyit was the Government which he partly blamed for the affair that gave him the chance to return to work after retirementA change in the tax rules affecting pensions was shortly followed by a job with the Department of Environment's Property Services Agencya post which carries him through to March and may see him stay until he is 70Putting it as politely as he canMr Tyson said the whole affair encouragedhim to return to paid employmentI hadn't planned to work at allAnd like all of the other investorshe and his wife were in a quandryThey wanted to do something but felt powerlessPursuing legal action would have cost them money they didn't have unless it meant selling their house which was not an optionbut doing nothing left them with the feeling that justice wasn't being doneSo they compromised and gave £100 to the Barlow Clowes Investors Group which was formed last July to represent the investors' interests and co-ordinate the fight for compensationThatsays Mr Tysonhas been their only blessingThey are dedicated people who clearly know what they are talking about and have guided us through itThose people are victimstoobut they have certainly kept us togetherThat asidethe last year has brought little respite from their ownvery personalcrisisThe Tysons have yet to see any cash payment from the liquidators who have been winding up BCI's affairsWhat little money has been recovered remains the subject of a legal tussle in the courts which may yet take months to resolveThey have been told that their claim may only amount to around £11,000 of their £15,000 as capital gains tax is likely to be deducted from the totalBut until they get any money backthe Tysons find themselves in the position

corporate bounty OutlookBy Roger CoweNFC stands as a monument to the irrelevance of both nationalisation and denationalisationand as a monument to the vision of Sir Peter Thompson and his colleagues whose commitment to employee involvement has made the transport groupwhich was floated in Februarythe one privatisation that got awayBut only a hiatus at National Carriers caused by the closure of British Rail's door-to-door parcels service in 1980 stopped NFC going the way of other privatisations into the pockets of disinterested individuals and institutionsThe resulting delay allowed Sir Peter to develop and lead the employee buy-out of the Pickfords and BRS groupAs a company with a heart and a determination to maintain employee control it is clearly a rogue among the 1980s herd of quick-buckknock-down salesBut it remains to be seen whether NFC is a throw-back to the 1970s or a model for the 1990sWhatever else it isthoughit has been successful in conventional business termsalthough not as successful this year as the table suggestsReported profits soared by a thirdBut the profits increase was helped by a suspension of pension fund contributions shared with employeesunlike most companiesand other special effectsWithout those benefits the profits would have been lower than last yearalthough the core transport and distribution divisions did much betterBut the property profit is expected to continue growingSimilarly the pensions holiday will continue for several yearsAt any rate NFC unique among public companies in giving a profits forecastbelieves profits will grow by another 10 per cent in the current yearThat is good news in the light of worsening market conditions for the removals and holiday businessesThe travel agency business has slumped into loss in the face of disappearing package holidays and market leader Lunn Poly's price-cutting tacticsThe worst is unlikely to be over yetNFC's caring approach makes it more reluctant than most companies to show employees the doorBut Sir Peter and his colleagues have also demonstrated their commitment to what the mission statement describes as a participative and results-oriented management stylemy italicsStaff in the travel business have already been cut by 15 per centAnd the crunch comes next month when the company has to face the possibility of closing down or selling off the whole business although this will be a last resort and an acquisition or joint venture may be more likelySuch hard decisions must be made easier by the better outlook elsewhere in the groupContract hire and the managed distribution business known as logisticshave both done wellAnd the property development operation more than doubled profitsThat does not prove that Sir Peter's participative style is reponsiblebut it does prove that it is not irresponsible as many bosses would claimThe style includes a consultation exercise on future strategyculminating in endorsement presumablyat the annual meetingObjectives include seeking improved employment opportunitiesSir Peter even suggested yesterday that business was not just about making profitsIt is about how you share them and who does well out of themMany of Sir Peter's fellow company chairmen will scoff at such socialist sentimentsBut they might ponder whether such sentiments are more in line with the German and Japanese approaches that will probably dominate the 1990s rather than are their traditional capitalist values that have dominated the 1980sStrong words and clear rulings from a hard-hitting legal eagleBy Daniel JohnSTRONG words and a tendency to make unambiguous rulings have epitomised Sir Anthony Barrowclough's five-year tenure in the office of Parliamentary Commissioner for AdministrationPopularly known as the Parliamentary OmbudsmanSir Anthony has been surprisingly open about his work given the secrecy that pervades WhitehallFirm judgments of the cases he has investigated have often been accompanied by hard-hitting comments about the problems his office has encounteredThis is very much a product of his legal background whichin a career spanning 40 years as a lawyerhas seen him spurn a more lucrative profession to concentrate on the injusticesthat accompany bureaucracies like the Civil ServiceBorn in 1924his ambitions were delayed by the outbreak of the second world war in which he served in the Royal Naval Reserve from 1943first in Coastal Forces and then on minesweepersrising to the rank of lieutenant before being demobilised three years laterHe resumed his studies in 1948 at New CollegeOxfordwhere he took a first class honours degree and was called to the bar a year laterA steady rise up the legal ladder took him into the commercial law field and a range of broader experience as a member of both the Monopolies and Mergers Commission 1966 to 1969and a legal member of the mental health tribunal for 22 years until 1982By thenhe had been a Recorder for ten years and had become a QC in 1974continuing in active practice until January 1985since when Sir Anthony he was knighted last year has acted as both Ombudsman and Health Service CommissionerBoth roles have involved handing out criticisma task he has not held back from especially in thisthe last year before he retiresBut for all of the work he has carried outBarlow Clowes has proved to the largest and most complex in the office's 22 year historyEven before he intervened last NovemberSir Anthony had indicated the DTI might have a case to answerYesterdayhis uncompromising conclusions left no one in doubt that it didNames urge settlementBy Ben LauranceREPRESENTATIVES of 1,600 Lloyd's of London names who lost hundreds of millions of pounds through syndicates run by Mr Dick Outhwaite yesterday appealed for an out of court settlement of a threatened legal wrangleMr Peter Nuttingchairman of the association which represents people who lost out when Mr Outhwaite pledged their money to meet US asbestos and pollution insurance claimsformally announced that writs have been served claiming negligent and reckless underwritingBut he addedWe don't want our day in courtwe would like to see a settlementThe writs are against 81 firms of Lloyd's members' agents and against the RM Outhwaite underwriting agency itselfMore than 1,600 names the people whose personal wealth is pledged to meeting insurance claims lost money when they found themselves having to meet huge bills for asbestosis and pollution claims after Mr Outhwaite agreed to take on the risks from other Lloyd's syndicates in 1982The committee headed by Mr Nutting has issued the writs on behalf of 814 names but hopes that more will join the actionWe are totally convinced as a committee that the losses that we are facing losses on an unprecedented scale are a result of reckless and negligent underwritingsaid Mr NuttingThe group maintains that by the time Mr Outhwaite agreed to take on the US risksthe dangers of asbestosis were already knowna Lloyd's working party had been set up in 1980 to look at the issueIf the Outhwaite investors get their way in courtmuch of the burden of the claims could fall on other Lloyd's underwriters who sell errors and omissionpoliciesdesigned to cover against losses because a professional simply made a mistakeA court hearing is unlikely before the end of next yearI found very questionable that it was no or littleconcern that investorscapital might be being eroded'A regulatory agency oughtto my mindby definition adopt a rigorous and enquiring approachBy Ben LauranceA PICTURE of incompetencelack of urgency and eagerness to hide anything which might embarrass Whitehall is revealed in yesterday's 170-page report by the OmbudsmanSir Anthony Barrowcloughon the the Department of Trade's handling of Barlow ClowesMost of the facts about how an investment group could be allowed to draw in tens of millions of pounds of people's savings for years after regulators had first spotted that things were amiss at Barlow Clowes were revealed in a report by Sir Godfray Le Quesne commissioned last year by the then Trade SecretaryLord YoungThe Le Quesne report was published 14 months agoIt reported only the facts of the affair and drew no conclusionsBut yesterday's document from the Ombudsman is specific in pinpointing the areas where the Department of Trade Industry was at faultAnd its findings lay the foundations for Sir Anthony's conclusion that investors who lost money in Barlow Clowes should receive compensation from the GovernmentThe DTI showed lack of a sufficiently rigorous and enquiring approachwhen looking at the activities of the investment groupMost damningly of allSir Anthony concludes that in 1985 the Department already knew that Barlow Clowes did not maintain proper recordsthat it had been trading without a licence and that investment watchdogs were worried about the group's activitiesThe DTI could have closed down the investment business there and thenInsteadBarlow Clowes was granted a licenceThe DTI said it wanted to avoid the risk of a disorderly collapsewhich would have threatened the savings of those people who had already put money into the fundsYesterday's report saysThe attractions of granting a licenceas a shield against accusations that the Department had with the knowledge that the partnership was unlicensed allowed them to carry on taking investorsmoneywere allowed to cloud the thinking within the DepartmentIt goes onToo little thought was given to the question of whether a legitimising licence would have been beneficial to investorsIf proper thought had been given to thatI think the conclusion must have been that it would not be beneficialI consider also that the decision in question was flawed to a degree by undue weight being given to the question of a disorderly collapseHad Barlow Clowes been shut down in 1985the total investment at risk in the offshore funds would have been less than £31 millionBy the time it was eventually closed in 1988new investors had brought the total to £116 millionAdministrative and clerical errors by the DTI between 1975 and 1981 meant that the Clowes business was unlicensedOn two occasionsonce in 1980 and once in 1982the DTI failed to act when it was told that Barlow Clowes was apparently dealing in investments without a licenceAnd the department ignored the fact that a warrant for the arrest of Mrs Elizabeth Barlowone of Barlow Clowes' founderswas issued in 1981 in connection with the collapse of a stockbrokerThe fact that the Department hadin effectadvised the partnership that it did not need a licence made it difficult for the Department to point a finger of blame at themsays Sir AnthonyThe lack of a licence in Barlow Clowes' early years may or may not have made a difference to the way investors' funds were handled during that timeBut if the British Barlow Clowes operation had been within the licensing netit is more likely that the Department of Trade would have found out at a much earlier stage that Mr Peter Clowes was running a parallel offshore operation first in Jersey and then in GibraltarMatters of concern would have included the extent to which United Kingdom residents were investors in the Jersey fundshow they had come to be investors in those fundshow those funds were managedwhether they were kept separate from the United Kingdom funds or whether there was intermingling the switching of money between UK and offshore fundsandultimatelywhether the Jersey funds as well as the United Kingdom funds could be properly accounted forSir Anthony goes onThe information I have been given by the joint liquidators of BCGM the British fundand BCI in Gibraltarindicates that in the period up to December 1984 there had been frequent movements of money or securities between the United Kingdom funds and the Jersey funds andmost important of allthat at December 1984 the gilt-edged securities and cash held for the Jersey funds were at least some £3.65 million less than the fundsobligations to investorsBut I think it highly unlikely that Mr Clowes could have found any means of ensuring that investigation of the matters in question was avertedwhile at the same time satisfying the Department that his operations could properly be licensedTo my mindit is a virtual certainty that the partnership's operations would have been brought to an endin one way or anotherwithin a relatively short time afterDecember 1984But it is in 1985 and subsequent years that Sir Anthony finds the Department of Trade's behaviour most lackingThe central mistake was the Department's decision to grant Barlow Clowes an investment licence in 1985The DTI had plenty of ammunition to back a decision to withhold a licenceThe Department had evidence of the very unsatisfactory state of affairs which existed within the partnershipMost importantlythe DTI asked Barlow Clowes to have its auditorsSpicer & Peglerlook at the accountsBut the DTI did not appreciate that the accountants' study missed the central point of the Department's inquirythe auditors were not asked to answer the simple question of whether there was enough money in Barlow Clowes' coffers to cover the amount owned to investorsSir Anthony saysThe Department were at fault in failing to appreciate that the instructions given to Spicers to carry out an audit of the partnership's client accounts would notat least as regards some important Barlow Clowes portfolioshave enabled any reassurance to be gained on the score of the concern that the partnership could not make the payments of income they had guaranteed without eroding clientscapitalThe portfolios which gave rise to this problem were those under whichbesides guaranteed income paymentsthere was a guarantee that a stated sum would be repaid to the investor at the future maturity date of his chosen stockAfter Barlow Clowes was granted its licence in 1985warning signs kept reappearingAnd by summer 1987 still a year before Barlow Clowes was closed it was obvious that something was seriously wrongThe Stock Exchange investigated Barlow Clowes because the company wanted to become a stockbrokerIt found some alarming evidenceThe Exchange spotted that Barlow Clowes' accounts were silent on the question of whether its investors' funds were sufficient to cover what savers were entitled toSpecificallythe SE found that although Barlow Clowes claimed to deal only in government stockevidence of their dealing in equities also had been foundThe Stock Exchange concluded that the accounts could be regarded as suspect because they made no reference to such businessaccording to Sir AnthonyThe Inland Revenue had told the SE that Barlow Clowes' advertising literature appeared misleading about the tax implications of investing in certain fundsClients did not receive regular information on where their money was invested or what their funds were now worthThe Ombudsmansays of the SE's findingsAmong the authorsconclusions was the view that there must be substantial doubts as to whether the Barlow Clowes and James Ferguson companies and their directors can be considered fit and properfor membership of the Stock ExchangeThere was evidence that Barlow Clowes investors' money had been put into shares in James Fergusonrun by Mr Clowes' ally Guy von CramerSir Anthony saysThe paper concluded that the applications for membership could not be supported and that there should be a full inquiry ihnto the takeover activities and share dealings of James Ferguson and its related companies and connectionsincluding the Barlow Clowes GroupThe Stock Exchange's damning report was sent to the Bank of England and to the Department of Trade's Licensing Unitwhich had responsibility for allowing financial groups to stay in operationThe letter to the DTI was sent on July 21987There was a further letter eight days laterSir Anthony saysIn his letter to the Licensing Unit principalthe Stock Exchange representative said that he was sceptical of the bad guys becoming cleantouch and was concerned about the future of the UK portfolio clients and the extent of resources within the portfoliosIn the months leading up to the Stock Exchange's damning findingsthe DTI's lack of concrete action was probably forgiveableOnce the DTI knew of the Stock Exchange's findings in July 1987there was no excuse for delayNeverthelessit was not until September 18 that a decision was made that a section 105 investigation should be recommended by the Minister and the submissions to that effect did no reach him until October 13says Sir AnthonyThe delays involved were altogether unacceptable in my view and I had no doubt that they amounted to maladministrationLate in Septemberthe DTI Licensing Unit was given a heaven-sent opportunity to actAccountants Touche Ross asked for an extension of time for the filing of a monitoring returngiving details of Barlow Clowes' finances which was due by the end of that monthThe DTI could have responded by saying that the absence of the monitoring return was a serious matterthat it would allow a short extensionbut that consideration would need to be given to revoking the licence if a satisfactory and duly verified monitoring return were not received by the specified dateSir Anthony concludes that the DTI did not adopt this tactic as a matter of urgencybecause of the inadequate grasp within the Licensing Unit of the detail of their powers under the Act which they had the task of administeringIn other wordsthe DTI had failed to understand fully its own legal powers with which it could have put pressure on Barlow ClowesIn the eventthe DTI only launched a secret inquiryIt took a further eight months before Barlow Clowes was closed downSir Anthony concludesA regulatory agency which is what the Department wereat the timein relation to the protection of investors oughtto my mindby definition adopt a rigorous and enquiring approach as regards material coming into its possession concerning an undertaking about which suspicions have been arousedand also as regards representations made to it on the part of the undertaking in questionAnd it wasin my viewthe lack of sufficiently rigorous and enquiring approach which led not only to the failure to appreciate that there was a Jersey partnership but also to some other of the faults I have identifiedOmbudsman slams DTI on Barlow Clowes affair Government ignored all warning signs for yearsNICHOLAS Ridley offered £150million in ex gratia payments to investors in Barlow Clowesbut said the Government did not accept the main findings of the Ombudsman's report into the DTI's handling of the affairwrites Paul NettletonThe Trade and Industry Secretary told the CommonsThe Government is not asserting that the conduct of the department was beyond criticismgiven the benefit of hindsightBut in the Government's view the Department's handling of the case was within the acceptable range of standards reasonably to be expected of a regulatorThe payments would be made without admission of fault or liabilityMr Ridley saidI give notice of our intention to pursue vigorously any claims which show prospects of reducing the cost to the public purse of these paymentsHe said recent legislation and jurisprudence made clear that regulators are not liable to investorsThe Government does not believe that it would be right for this case to be treated as a precedentMr Gordon Brownshadow trade secretaryaskedWhy have we had to rely on the Ombudsman to confirm the mismanagementthe maladministration and incompetence that was widely known more than a year agoIt was strange that he was prepared to pay out £150million and yet he continues to deny the Government's responsibility for mistakes and does not even apologise for his department's roleThe reason for the payments was not the fecklessnessgullibility or incompetence of the small investorbut the fecklessnessgullibility and incompetence of the Governmentwhich for months and for years ignored all warningsHe askedWho in the Government intends to take responsibility for this negligence on a vast scalethat is now costing vast sums of public moneyMr Ridley said that of the five charges of maladministration the Ombudsman only attached great significanceto one which was a new point about the Jersey partnershipThe first criticism of the DTI dated from 1975he saidadding that Mr Brown should not seek to make party political pointsHe said the gross cost of the scheme would be £150millionbut the liquidators expected to be able to return over £60million and the net cost would be reduced still further if sums were received from third partiesBackbench MPs largely welcomed the compensation announcementbut insisted the Government must learn the lessons of the affairMr Ian Stewart C. Hertfordshire Nsaid Mr Ridley had announced a handsome scheme of recompenseBut he addedIt didn't require a great deal of insight in 1985 to appreciate that the business of Barlow Clowes was not at that time being run in a fashion which made it an obvious candidate for a licenceMr Alf Morris LabWythenshawewelcomed a step forward for the victims of a huge and vile swindleTwo of his elderly constituents had lost not only their life savingsbut their homesBut they had received a further hammer blowwith a demand yesterday for thousands of pounds from the Inland Revenue for taxation which they had been told by Barlow Clowes had been deducted at sourceShares tumble after Wall Street slumpBy Mark MilnerSHARE prices in London shrugged off Monday's sharp fall on Wall Street but then succumbed to fresh falls in New York late in the dayMonday's 46 point drop in the US market meant a nervous opening in London but the fall in FTSE 100 index was confined to to single figures until mid-afternoonThen the index fell by almost 20 points below Monday's close after Wall Street turned a tentative opening into a 25 point slumpThe subsequent rally in New York came too late to help London sharesAt the close of tradethe Dow Jones index was 1.92 points lower at 2,695.61The FTSE 100 index finished 16.4 points lower at 2,342.1Howeverone share dealer commented that with many institutional investors reluctant to open aggressive new positions ahead of the new yearlosses were expected to be containedOn the foreign exchangesthe pound was a fraction down at $1.6020 but gained more than a pfennig to DM2.7760
