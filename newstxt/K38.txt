WE PROMISE FULL CONSULTATION AT ALL TIMESIT HAS been reported that the Flaybrick Chapels in Boundary RoadBidstonwere to be renovated and turned into a Crisis Centrefor BirkenheadAs vicar of Bidston and deeply involved in the plansmay I correct a few misleading rumoursFirstlyany plans for the chapel complex are only in embryonic formWe have no money whatsoever in the kittyand things are at a very early stage of developmentIt has always been my intention to call a public meeting for all interested parties once we have something definite to reportWe would never dream of beginning anything of this kind without gaining the views of local residentsSecondlyI am well aware that the idea of a Crisis Centreconjures up all kinds of picturesPerhaps that is not the best way of describing what our ideas areWhat we envisage is somewhere open and staffed 24 hours a dayseven days a weekwhere anybody can come for help and adviceOur aim would be to link in with all the caring agencies in the area and provide care and assistance as and when it was neededAny activity taking place around the refurbished buildings would be carefully controlled and would not be troublesomeThe idea would be very much an extension of our activities at St Oswald's Church Centre in Bidston VillageSince this centre has been open vandalism has ceasedThirdlyour plan is to screen the buildings from the rest of the cemetery and to have the entrance on Boundary RoadPlease rest assured that nothing will get beyond the earliest stages of preparation without full consultation taking placeIf anyone has any further questionsdo not hesitate to contact me at St Oswald's Church Centre telIce cream charges have certainly changed since the days of this 1920sStop me and buy onetrike Ice cream racketAS SUMMER comes in and the demand for ice cream increases so the opportunities arise for the vendors to overchargeespecially when parents are treating their childrenPrices for ices vary considerably and this also applies to qualityRecentlyI was charged £1.45 for a cornetto-typeand a choc iceAs there were a number of Wall's stickers on the vanI thought I was getting ices of their makeThe charge at my local sweetshop for genuine Wall's Cornetto and a choc ice is £1.10Name and address suppliedStrong campaignsI READ the letter headed White elephantswhich concerned the PlayhouseEveryman and William Roberts CentreI find it amazing that reader Mrs J.  took the time and effort to castigate another community Norris Green for fighting to keep an asset in an area that is one of the most socially and economically deprived in this cityMrs  states that the people who want these facilities should pay for themWe doDoes she think that we get access to these facilities free of chargeWe not only pay an entrance fee to access these facilitieswe also pay a community charge for local amenitiesThe quote These outfits lose money because no one wants themdoes not make senseIf no one wants themwhy are there such strong campaigns to keep themMurder victim Fiona JonesTHIS JUSTICE IS A FRENCH FARCETHE ABSURDLY lenient sentence given to Frederic Blanckethe French hospital worker who brutally murdered British school teacher Fiona Jonesis a travesty of justiceAfter attacking Fiona and leaving her for deadhe later returned and repeatedly slashed her throatignoring her pleas for mercyThis monster could be freeto possibly kill againin less than seven yearsTherefore the French judicial system must at least review this erroneous judgementFiona's mother says she will never set foot in France again in view of the treatment by the French towards our British fishermenfarmers and truckersThat may not be too bad a criterion for many of usPlease support Fiona Jones's parents by asking your local MP to take up their causeEcho's June 1st headlineWHAT ON earth are the bosses of Wirral Social Services being paid forI ask this question after reading in the Echo about their latest crazy scheme sending out instructions to all child-minders that they must feed their young charges culture foodBy this they apparently mean curryetcCurry is an acquired taste and heavily spiced food is surely not suitable for the stomachs of very young childrenThese Social Services bosses should leave English people to feed their children in the way they see fitjust as ethnic groups feed their childrenIf they think forcing strange food down children's throats will enhance good race relationsthen they are barking up the wrong treeIt is only by teaching respect for one another that different races can live peacefully togetherCAN ANYBODY be expected to take the Deputy Director of Wirral Social Services seriously when he suggests that feeding curry to toddlers will help them counteract the evils of racismOn reading the Echo report I had to look at the top of the page to make certain that the date was June 1st and not April 1stPrincess Diana under fire from reader D.P.  of BootleDi can't knowPRINCESS Diana knows nothing about the lives of ordinaryeveryday people and of inner city deprivation and squalorShe cannot even begin to comprehend how a mother feels about bringing up children on state benefits or the frustration and despair of young people who can see no likelihood of ever finding meaningful employmentNor can she be expected toYet here she is on television telling us all how to manage our lives and formulating phrases about how best to overcome adversityIf only those grey establishment figures would stop putting palliatives into her mouth in order to mitigate her credibility under the CrownI MUST PAY £22.50 MORE A WEEKWHY WAS so much noise and trouble caused over the poll taxNow that the council tax is implementednot a dicky bird from LabourLiberal or the people of any of the big citiesNow tax on electricgasand every other fuel and still no shoutingThe council taxincrease in rentsand tax on electric and gas now means I must find approximately another £22.50 a weekI wonder if my pension will be increased to meet some of these demandsThe council tax is a disgraceThese valuations are way over the top and it is time a lot of these councillors where brought down to earthNo to 40hr weekTHE CONTROVERSY concerning the EEC directive for a working week of not more than 48 hours is beyond beliefAnyone who knows anything about the building workers and continued process working will understand that there are numerous reasons why it is impossible to have a 40 hour working weekSickness of workers requires skilled process workers from other shifts to fill the gapSelected holiday dates also cause an effectThis means a slight rise in the wages account which is no different than working overtime for cleaning and maintenance of machineryPoliticians should think and inquire before they speak trashLive in harmonyWHY CAN'T everybody be in harmony with each otherI am sick of people arguing over their colour because it affects so many children and they have to suffer the consequences
