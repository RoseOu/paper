Next Thursday Chileans will go to the polls to elect a successor to General Pinochetwho has ruled with an iron fist since the overthrow of Allende in 1973Whoever wins will face a dilemma whether to prosecute military personnel for human rights abusesDuring the 1970s Andres Valenzuelarightserved in a death squad which hunted and killed Chilean CommunistsMost were tortured before they diedValenzuela now lives among other exiles in FranceIain Guest talked to him there Portrait of a torturerNEXT Thursday's elections will mark a red letter day for tens of thousands of Chileans who have been exiled by Pinochet's harsh ruleMany are already eagerly making plans to return homeBut for one Chilean exileAndres ValenzuelaThursday will be much like any other day longboring and lonelyIt will pass in a succession of aimless walks and endless glasses of beer in the picturesque little French town where he has sought refugeIt's only when you've heard his extraordinary story that you realise this is no ordinary manI found myself surreptitiously studying himDoes he face show courage and conviction or does it betray guiltAre those eyes shiftyor merely tiredCertainlyhe seems too slight of stature to have handcuffed heavier men and hauled them up by their wrists to hangagonisinglyfrom hooksToo unsettled to have been a torturerDuring the past 16 yearsby conservative estimates782 Chileans have disappearedanother 2,000 have been killedand several thousands have been torturedValenzuela took an active part in this dirty warHe served in a shadowy military death squad that kidnapped and murdered scores of ChileansBut he has also confessedand this makes him specialValenzuela could be a star witness for the prosecution in the event of any inquiry into human rights abuses by the next Chilean governmentTorturerThe word is baldimpersonalBut what of the person behind the labelHow did Andres Valenzuela get sucked inand what prompted his change of heartThese were the questions I wanted to put when I sought him out in FranceI'm not sure I have all the answersHe was direct and helpfulbut he also steered me away from his personal lifeHe knows that wordstoocan woundHis disclosures have already caused several deathsand every time he talks it reminds the world of his unsavoury pastOther Chilean exiles in France still find it hard to accept himAs he saysI have very few friendsHow does a torturer get startedValenzuela's experience suggest disturbingly that it could happen to anyoneHe was born into a lower-class family in the small seaside village of Papudo where his father caught conger eels for the tourist restaurantsIt wasremembersAndresa happyuncomplicated upbringingIn April 1974seven months after the coup which brought Pinochet to powerhe arrived at the Air Force base of Colina on the outskirts of Santiago to begin his two years of military serviceHe was just 18After three months at Colina the young recruit was posted to the Academy of Aerial War in an affluent Santiago suburbValenzuela's dirty war was about to beginHe was assigned to what was vaguely described as guard dutywarned not to talk about his work and taken down to the basement to startI was veryvery frightenedhe recallsBlindfoldedhandcuffed prisoners were crammed into dormitories and passagesmany wearing Air Force uniformsThese officers had been loyal to AllendeThe young conscript was broken in slowlyHe did not attend torture personallybut he found his natural aversion to mistreating a defenceless person gradually being erodedThe prisoners in the basement were dehumanisedblindfoldedanonymous subversivesIt was in the War Academy that Valenzuela learned how to detaininterrogateand exploit the fears of prisoners while psychologists looked for weakness in the young draftees and weeded out those who seemed sentimentalValenzuela himself was promoted from guard duty to acting as a back-up in kidnapping operationsThese early months gave him a brutally clear idea of what lay aheadHe knew that kidnap and torture were a blatant violation of the Chilean military code and that under the same code he was entitled to register any reservations with a superior officerBut he never protestedWhyWhat could I have saidThat I was not in agreementI would have been killedIn Mid 1975the counter-intelligence services of the NavyAir Force and Police linked up to form the Joint Command against Subversionand began working out of two suburban safe-housesor nestsThe Command's strength rarely exceeded 25 menbut they were carefully selected for their ferocity and reliabilityThe man who commanded the Air Force unitRoberto Fuentes Morrisonwas a fanatical anti-Communist known as WallyHe was ruthless with anything short of total obedienceThe Joint Command began to hunt down prominent Communistsand on August 281975they seized a Young Communist leader named Miguel Rodriguez GallardoGallardo had pulled himself up from poverty by sheer force of personalitytapping the electricity lines that ran above the shanty town and reading Marx by the lightHe was mercilessly torturedblindfolded and trussed up in a cupboard for four monthsbut he refused to breakValenzuela was fascinated by Gallardo's willpowerand as their relationship changed Gallardo established a subtle ascendancy over his young captorOn one occasionValenzuela arrived in a torture room to find Gallardo hanging by handcuffs from a hook and whimperingValenzuela touched his armI'll let you downDon'treplied GallardoWally might come inand you'd be in troubleI'll stick it outOne important Communist still eluding capture was Jose WeibelSecretary General of the Young Communistsand the Joint Command decided to try and locate him through his brother Ricardoa bus driverRicardo Weibel was seized and brought to the base for 12 days of rough treatmentbefore being released and sent homeThen an order came to pick up Weibel again I had to hide my dismay when Weibel was bought back without a blindfold a sure sign that he was to be killedSure enoughsoon afterwards Weibel and Gallardo were pushed into a vanVALENZUELA was told to burn their ID cardswallets and spectaclesBefore they leftGallardo shook Valenzuela's hand and thanked him for the cigarettes he had given him in captivityIt was a wrenching momentI admired Gallardo the mostsays ValenzuelaHe was brave until the very last momentValenzuela's only real friend was another recruit named Bratti Cornejo who had been drafted at the same timeWithin weeks of Gallardo's murderValenzuela found himself taking part in Bratti's executionBratti had been discovered spying for a rival security serviceHe was druggedbundled into the boot of a car and driven to a canyon on the outskirts of SantiagoAs Valenzuela took off Bratti's handcuffs his friend murmuredIt's cold tonightValenzuela choked out a reply and watched while Bratti was shot by FifaPalma Ramirezone of the most savage officersThey pushed the body off the cliffbut it caught in bushesValenzuelaholding on to the killer's handdislodged his friend's corpseI looked down and thought he'd let me fall tooThe Joint Command began taking risksJose WeibelRicardo's brotherwas snatched off a bus in broad daylight while travelling with his familyThe man who succeeded him as Secretary General of the Young CommunistsCarlos Contreras Malujewas picked up after putting up a struggle in the streetAs people crowded roundValenzuela and the others bundled Malujekicking and screaminginto a carThe injured man was taken back and beaten up before being taken off and killedWith thisthe freewheeling murder came to an endMaluje's spirited resistance had provoked such an uproar that the muzzled Supreme Court issued a habeas corpus order to locate him the first against the Air Force since 1973But did Valenzuela himself participate directly in tortureHe was certainly present on many occasionsEvery detainee was torturedirrespective of agesex or backgroundValenzuela admits to beating prisoners at the moment of their detentionhauling them to the torture roomswatching them writhe and holding them downHe also handcuffed prisonersswung them up on hooks and watched them dangleAll this constitutes torture under international lawBut he also insists that his main task was to deliver the prisoner to the torturerswho were specialists in interrogation with long experience in the serviceNot all the interrogators were veteransThe ferocious WallyFuentes Morrison only joined up after the 1973 coupBratti torturedEven a prisoner named Carol Floreswho turned informanttorturedValenzuela himself was instructed in interrogation techniquesWhatever his personal misgivingsValenzuela hid them well and when his compulsory military service ended he signed on for a permanent career in the Air ForceIn 1978in an attempt to wipe the slate cleanPinochet declared an amnesty to cover all human rights abuses since the coupValenzuela felt reassuredBetween 1976 and 1983he rose steadily through a series of promotions and posts in Air Force securityThen in September 1983WallyFuentes Morrison let him know that his skills were once again required for a special operationSeveral members of the left wing Revolutionary MovementMIRwere hiding out in a residential safe-houseOn the evening of September 7 a small army of security agentsincluding Wally and Valenzuelabegan converging on the houseAround 9 pm they opened fire with a heavy machine gunAt the same timeAndres Valenzuela shot out the street lightsThe attackers then called by loudhailer on those in the house to surrenderA young man came out with his hands in the airTwo agents ran up and shot him deadAs soon as the shooting stoppedValenzuela was told to pull the body away from the houseHe then went in and found the body of a young womanBy the time he had pulled the corpse out into the streetValenzuela's clothes were stained with bloodIT WAS a full year before he made the break but eventuallyon August 211984he went over to one of the more independent local magazinesCauceand asked for its leading journalist Monica GonzalezThe resulting interview was heavy going for both of themMonica had been a close friend of Ricardo and Jose WeibelNow she was listening to their kidnapperWhat she remembers most was his self-disgust and terrorMonica rang lawyers at the Vicariate of Solidaritywhich had been set up by the Catholic Church in 1975 and was by now Chile's leading human rights organizationThe lawyers took Valenzuela off to record his testimonyA few days laterValenzuela went undergroundAfter several months in hiding he crossed into Argentina and left for FranceMonica's interview was published in December 1984 and its impact was swift and savageFirst to suffer were the relatives of those who had been kidnapped by the Joint CommandThey now knew the terrible trutheven though without a body they still could not mournThey gave Valenzuela little credit for speaking outThe impact on the Vicariate of Solidarity was even more violentThe Valenzuela file had passed to Jose Manuel Paradaa senior Vicariate officialOn March 29 1985Jose Manuel's inquiry came to a brutal endHe was picked up with two other CommunistsThe following morningthe three bodies were found near Santiago airportwith the throats cutChilean justice was not totally intimidatedJudge Carlos Cerda from the Santiago Appeals Court was investigating the disappearance of several leading Communists and Valenzuela's testimony was the first solid proof that the security forces had been involved in kidnappingCerda interviewed those named in his testimonyincluding Wally Fuentes Morrisonand then threw down the gauntlet to PinochetIgnoring Pinochet's 1978 amnestyhe described the Joint Command as an illegal associationand charged 40 of those implicated with illegal deprivation of libertyThey included Andres ValenzuelaThe judge's colleagues in the Judiciaryhoweverhad no wish to confront PinochetThe Supreme Court charged Cerda himself with lack of disciplinesuspended him on half pay for two monthsand replaced him by another judge who dutifully closed his caseJudge Cerda points out that the case remains technically open until he personally closes itHe strongly implies that this loophole could allow him to resume the case after electionsin which case Andres Valenzuela could be a key witnessIfthat isValenzuela can ever return to ChileThis has been open to doubt since June 81989 when an extreme left-wing group pumped 20 bullets into Valenzuela's former chiefWallyFuentes MorrisonValenzuela's testimony had confirmed Wally's involvement in several brutal killingsand Valenzuela's first reaction was that he had unwittingly taken yet another lifeHis second reaction was gut terror that his former comrades would come looking for himValenzuela insists he's willing to return to ChileThere ishe saysa lot more to tellBy a strange twist of fatethe first Chilean to welcome Valenzuela to his new home in France was Castroa Miristawho was captured in broad daylight and stripped to his underwear back in December 1974while Valenzuela stood guard at the cornerCastro has swallowed his doubts and hired Valenzuela as a cook in his small restaurantIt is one of the few gestures of real friendship encountered by this lonely man in his long and tormented odysseyIain Guest is the reporter in next Sunday's BBC-1 Everyman programmeCalled To Account 10.20pmwhich examines justice in ChileGallardothe Young Communist leader who was tortured then killed I
