Cricket First TestAzharuddin's daring defianceAS anti-climaxes gothey do not come better than thisAs historynothing that happened here yesterday was ever likely to match the events of Fridaybut as entertainersthe Indian batsmen generally hold their ownThey are still 277 behind England and only 43 ahead of Graham Goochbut for exhilarating strokeplaythe honours are all with the Indian captainMohammed AzharuddinThe unchallenged winner of the wooden spoon after putting England in on Thursdayhe bounced back yesterday with an innings of magnificent irresponsibilityHe reached three figuresfor the fourth time against Englandin only 130 minutes and 87 ballsIt was the fastest hundred in a Test match in England since the heady days of 1981and as a gambler's last throwit was in the same class as Botham's 149In three innings against England this summerhe has yet to be outNot that Gooch was finishedFour years agowhen Ian Botham returned from suspension and took a wicket with his first ballGooch trotted up from slip and asked himWho writes your scriptsWhoever it wasGooch seems to have hired themYesterdaynot content with turning England into a winning team and making the highest Test score of the modern erahe threw himself the ball and removed the dangerous Sanjay Manjrekar with his third deliveryThe next wicket to fall was that of Ravi ShastriGooch caught himAt pounds 150the fee paid to the man-of-the-match adjudicatorRay Illingworthwill work out at about pounds 300 per second's thoughtUnlessthat isAzharuddin gets another 217 tomorrowIndia had resumed at 48 for no wicketneeding another 406 to avoid the follow-onShastri and Navjot Sidhu continued to enjoy both good fortune and the spaces which Gooch's attacking field left openDevon Malcolm and Angus Fraser opened the bowling and both started as they were to go onMalcolm's first ball was cut for four by SidhuFraser's first ball beat Sidhu outside off-stumphis secondangled inwas worth a shout for lbwThe disappointing slowness of the pitch allowed both openers to play Malcolm off the back footand therefore to drive his attempted yorkersHe has two kinds of Test performance five for very fewand none for a lotand this was looking like the latterBut Frasersteady as ever after missing five Tests through injuryfound enough lift to have Sidhu sharply caught off bat and pad by John MorrisMorris's contribution to this match is unlikely to find much space in Wisdenbut he already looks the partWhen Chris Lewis replaced Malcolmball dominated bat for the first time in the matchwith nothing to show for itLewis bowled a yard quicker than on his debut at Edgbastonhit an impeccable lengthand moved the ball awayWhen he was not bowlinghis cat-like fielding at midwicket kept an appreciative crowd happyShastri had gone onbarely noticedto 50when Gooch's gentle swingers drew Manjrekar into a loose cut and Jack Russell took the catchDilip Vengsarkar came in looking for his fourth hundred in as many Lord's appearances and immediately joined Shastri in exploiting the unpatrolled third-man boundaryAfter lunch 123 for two off 45 oversIndia stepped on the gas and Gooch turnednot before timeto the off-spin of Eddie HemmingsShastri blocked his first three ballsand hit the next three for 4-4-6 with a straight drive and two elegant swings over mid-wicketMalcolm's return brought him a straight push for three and a ninth Test hundredbut he immediately drove half-heartedly at Hemmings and gave Gooch a simple catch at mid-onVengsarkarwho had been ticking along nicelywas now upstaged by AzharuddinWhatever the opposite of a captain's innings ishe was intent on playing itHe got off the mark with an uppish straight drive for fourwhich might have given a less myopic bowler than Malcolm a return catchand in Malcolm's next overhe attempted a square slash whichif he had got an edgemight have prevented him ever setting foot in India againHappily he missedtried the shot again a few minutes laterand middled itHe was sufficiently troubled by Malcolm's bouncer to stand frozen at the crease and take it on the helmetbut sufficiently brave to try to hook the inevitable follow-upHe took three audacious fours off an over from Hemmingsand the loss of Vengsarkarflicking at one of Fraser's worst deliveriesdid nothing to sober him upHis fifty contained 11 foursand he celebrated with three moreSachin Tendulkar came in to a reception whose volume and pitch tended to confirm what Bishen Bedi had been saying about his sex appealand there was the arresting sight of a 41-year-old bowler taking on two batsmen whose combined age was 42After an hour had been lost to rain straight after teaTendulkar drove loosely at Lewis and lost his middle stumpThe only man capable of stopping his flow of boundaries was Dickie Birdwho took the players off for bad light for quarter of an hour at 5.30The new ball was taken as soon as it was availableand entrusted to LewisAzharuddin gave him the three-fours-in-an-over treatmentdriving all three off the back footHe may have been missed on 96 by Morrislow at mid-wicketMorris may have decided that sections of the crowd would riot if he held itLewis gave way to Fraserand Azharuddin brought up a great hundredand 1,000 for the matchwith an easy clip for threeHe lost Manoj Prabhakarcarried away by the exuberance of his own and everybody else's strokeplaybut Kapil Dev survives and he is the only Indian who has made a faster Test hundred than Azharuddin'sIf the follow-on now loomed largeAzharuddin could not see itThe batting triumphs of Graham Gooch and Graeme HickPage 24 Motor RacingFighting Senna refuses to succumbBrazilian overcomes cramp and gremlins to keep Prost waitingFrom MAURICE HAMILTON in Jerez de la FronteraAYRTON SENNA did all he could to keep the championship open by yesterday winning the Spanish Grand Prix whichafter a week of accusations and exclusionswas something of an anti-climaxSenna led from the start andapart from a brief skirmish in the opening lapsnever came under serious pressureThe Ferrari of Gerhard Berger finished second26 seconds ahead of Alain Prost's McLarenProst's result does little to further his cause in the championship if he has to drop his lower scores but Senna now knows that he must win the final two races in Japan and AustraliaProstmeanwhilecan do no more and the pressure is now with his team-mate to repeat yesterday's performanceWhile Senna's steady but swift progress made his 20th Grand Prix victory look easythe reigning world champion says this race has been one of the toughestThis is a very difficult circuitSenna saidI expected it to be hard becausewhen we tested here last FebruaryI did a full race distance and it was hard workvery painfulAfter almost two hours at the wheel yesterdaySenna limped away from his carthe only obvious sign that he had suffered from brake trouble during the last quarter of the 73-lap raceI had cramp in my right legthe Brazilian explainedI was going as carefully as I could because I had a 25-second cushion over Berger so I was able to slow down a bit and the pain easedAlsoI had trouble with the gearboxthe lever became spongy and I wasn't sure what was happeningIt was quite a fretful race for me in many waysIf Senna had not either won the race or finished secondhe would have been out of the championshipSenna said he realised that a good start was vitalIf Berger took the lead into the first cornerthen Senna would have difficulty getting by on such a tight and twisting circuitBerger saidHe made it to the first corner ahead of me and I tried to hang onI pushed as hard as I could but it was obvious there was no chance of passing himBerger then decided to wait until the scheduled pit stops in the hope that the Ferrari crew could steal an advantage over the McLaren mechanicsUnfortunately for Bergerboth stops were exceptionally slick andjudging by the controversial aftermath of Nigel Mansell's botched pit stop in Portugal last weekperhaps that is just as wellIt is fair to say that this race lacked the energetic input normally associated with Mansellbanned from yesterday's Grand Prix after breaking the regulations at Estoril last SundayOnce the pit stopsshortly before half distancewere overthe race became even more tedious as Berger heeded sagging oil pressure and reduced his paceThere was not even the threat of an attack by Prost since hetoowas suffering from gearbox troubleThis result is exactly what I was looking forProst saidIt is very difficult to overtake on this circuitso it was really mission impossible to get ahead of Senna and Berger in the early stagesShortly after the start I had problems with Gerhard's oil all over my visorso I just drove my taxi home to take third placeClearlythe gearbox remained the Achilles' heel for the McLaren-Honda and it will doubtless cause Senna one or two anxious moments before this season ends in Adelaide on 5 NovemberI know it's going to be very hard for mesaid SennaBut I don't intend to give upI will fight all the wayThat is a sentiment which is quietly echoed by McLaren and Honda sinceif Prost wins the titlehe will take the coveted No. 1 to Ferrari next yearWhile Prost and Senna continued their dispute for this year's titleJean Alesi reinforced pit lane opinion that the young Frenchman is a future championAfter a stirring driveAlesi finished fourth for Tyrrell andalong the wayhe had to deal forcefully with Britain's Martin Brundlethe Brabham driver eventually spinning offBrundle's trouble had been caused by a

tight and efficient a force as Graham Lowe's team of four years agobut with a virtual Test side outshould have been far too strong for Murphy's collection of reservesThat Saints managed to cause an

wasted two excellent try opportunties with careless forward passesand gifted St Helens the opening try when David Watson allowed Alan Hunte a 15th-minute interceptionQuick replies by Kelly Shelford and Mark Elia led to the suspicion that New Zealand could score at will and were easing themselves into their stridebut doubts arose early in the second half with a succession of missed chancesIt was Stuart Evansbringing a touch of Cardiff Arms Park to the proceedings with a pushover try in the right cornerwho brought Saints to within a point at 14-15New Zealand pushed out to 26-15 with a Kevin

to scatter the ashesOn and off the field the national game of the Land of Song is in a discordant messLosing was one thing but to lose as spinelessly as the Welsh XV did to Bridgend on Saturday was to add insult to severely injured prideIn all honesty we should have won by at least 15 pointsBrian Nicholasthe Bridgend coachsaidas if 24-17 and derisive chants of Easyeasywere not bad enoughthis humiliation was against a side who have made a wretched start to the season a week earlier Pontypool had given them a 35-6 going-over and were short of at least half-a-dozen first-choice playersFour

opposition a hammering and at half-timebuilding on their win over Newbridgeit looked as if they wouldThey had weathered Bridgend's early furyconceding a try before coming back with some confidence to score three of their ownBut Wales were having us onFrom the comparative opulence of 17-6 they then slipped into penury by conceding 18 unanswered pointsBridgend raised their game against Walesnow Wales must do precisely the same against New ZealandNo one who was at the Brewery Field perhaps not even the selectorswould give twopence for their ability to do soThe backs were mainly pedestrian but the fundamental problem lay elsewhereApart from Kevin Moseley's steady supply from the line-outthere was nothing much to commend in a Welsh forward effort which reverted to the very worst Eighties stereotype of staticcumbersome donkeys only too willing to slow the game to walking paceWhen the pressure comes onplayers revert to bad habitsRyan saidThe All Blacks would treat such an outmoded approach with the scorn it deservesalthough on the other hand they might have been impressed with Bridgend's contrasting mobility and aggressionThe back row were swifter to the loose ballhad a clearer

describe Saturday's match between Chelsea and ArsenalWellI seem to recall a London gallery exhibiting a pile of rubbishwhich was considered valid art by the proprietors and drew a large attendanceThe only redeeming feature of a goallessworthless event at Stamford Bridge was that it did not require a grantYet the Chelsea managerBobby Campbelland Arsenal assistantTheo Foleyagreed it had been a good matchand the spectators' complaints were mutedSome even applauded the players at the endIt takes all sortsBobby Robson was there to assess World Cup candidatesbut nothing positive emerged from 90 minutes of scuffling that made one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of Rangers' European Cup exit in Munich three days earlierAt least the outcome was appropriateHad either of the teams wonthey would have taken the League leadershipInstead Liverpool stayed top without kicking a ballTelevision had postponed Manchester United's scheduled visit to Anfield so it could be shown live on 22 Decemberthe longest nightLondon's leading pairas if piqued by thisturned 30 September into the longest afternoonOn and on it draggedLacking a goal that might have altered its chemistryit remained a matter of dull physicsYet many of the crowd were kept interested by the possibility of victorywhich isI supposewhat derbies are aboutThey are so frequent these days in Londonwhich has eight of 20 First Division clubsthat we must expect aesthetic considerations to be overriddenWhythoughcould these supposed championship contenders not have tried to emulate the fine passing that had sprinkled the previous weekend's Merseyside joustThe simple answer is that Chelsea are in a false position and Arsenalon this evidenceslightly jaded championsThey ought to have pocketed three points in the first half-hour but Tony Adamsa more threatening centre-forward on his forays than the current Alan Smithmissed the target with two headers and David Rocastle let Dave Beasant save a penaltymuch as the stretch-version keeper had done for Wimbledon in the 1988 FA Cup finalNow an Arsenal team in peak health would have kept a grip on the matchThis one could notAs George Graham indicated upon his side's accession to the titlethey would need more composure and sophistication to match Liverpool in the longer termHe chose not to hasten the process by buyingAfter allhe had just the man on his staffBut Paul Davis remains unfitHis absence is increasingly conspicuous and Liverpoolfor the momentin a super league of oneDavisof coursewould have walked into England's team in Poland a week on

class yet but may have to play in ChorzowIf soit will be a gamblebecause he flopped on his only previous international appearance in Saudi ArabiaThe odds are favourable enough according to Chelsea's Mike Hazardwho said of his adversaryHe could cope in Polandnot just because of his ability to close people down and use the ball wellbut temperament you saw that when he scored the goal that won Arsenal the LeagueVery kindbut international players are supposed to be habitually influentialand it was Hazard who in the second halfwith a few incisive passesgifts from the heavens on a day like thisleft a greater markChelsea might have won had the ball not kept turning into a Mexican bean at Kerry Dixon's feetCampbell's hard-working side are still trying to sort out their systemwhich

Saturdayneitherin truthmade the heart poundDorigo at least had the satisfaction of seeing his direct opponent and England colleague David Rocastle withdrawnAll in allBobby Robson must have found it about as fruitful as a day trying to get in touch with Brian CloughThere washoweverone aspect that deserves commendationAfter 16 minutes Graham Roberts was injured by a tackle for which Perry Groves

giving serious consideration to the swap proposed by Everton which would take Paul StewartTottenham's blunt instrument of a centre-forwardto Goodison Park in exchange for Tony CotteeThe deal would have been done by now but for Venables's reservations about playing two penalty-area sniffers together without an orthodox No. 9 to provide an aerial targetIt worked at West Hamwhere Cottee enjoyed a profitable partnership with Frank McAvenniewho is scarcely from the Mick Harford mouldAnd anywaythe bottom line should be Cottee is unquestionably a better footballer than StewartIn contrast to his partner's thud and blunderLineker's finishing was of the highest orderHis second goal was the highlight of the afternoon the single-minded determination to score almost as impressive as the execution which saw him hold off Paul Parker and Alan McDonald and allow the ball to run past him before spinning and shooting across David Seamanfrom right to leftTwo-nil up at home against moderate opposition

beats filthy rich every timebut after several years of battling to remain buoyant in the remorseless wake of the MaktoumsRobert Sangster clambered back on to terra firma with his most significant win for a long time in Saturday's Hoover Fillies' Mile at AscotSilk Slippers enabled Sangster slowly-sinking in the super league of owners to regain a foothold by wearing down the red-hot favouriteMoon Cactusowned ironically by Sheikh Mohammedin the dying strides of an event that has become a fertile proving ground for Classic filliesWhat a difference a few precious centimetres can make in this game of high stakesOn both her outings Silk Slippers has thrust her attractive nose in front just where it matters and in so doing has established herself not merely as a valuable stud prospectbut an exciting candidate for next year's 1,000 Guineas and OaksSangster had been leading owner in this country five times in eight years up to 1985 when Sheikh Mohammed led the Maktoum chargetaking the No. 1 spot four times in row in the past four seasonsAnd the Sheikh's dominance has been maintained this year as he heads the table with some £1.75m in prize moneyhalf a million ahead of his older brotherHamdan Al Maktoumwho owns Nashwanwith Sangster languishing in 10th place with a mere £250,000 or so in the kittySilk Slippers may not enable Sangster to challenge the Arab supremacybut an English Classic success after a five-year gap would come like manna from heavenSilk Slippers certainly looks the partbeing a staying filly with speed in the mould of Midway Ladywho took the 1,000 and Oaks three years agoWhat was so impressive about Silk Slippers's victory was that she twice had to overcome difficulties in running and William Hill's offer of 33-1 about the daughter of Nureyev for the Oaks is particularly temptingShe certainly looks a more attractive three-year-old prospect than Digressionwho won the big juvenile colts' eventthe Royal Lodge StakesDigression won well enoughbut the big minus factor against him is the fact that he is by the American stallionSeattle Slewwhose progeny have tended not to train on over hereSheikh Mohammed's Bridal Toastwho finished powerfully to take second place could have more scope to progress as a Derby contenderFascinating though they arethoughts of Classic confrontations to come were put on to the back-burner by another dazzling performance from Zilzalwho stamped himself as one of the outstanding milers of recent years with a thrashing of the French championPolish PrecedentWalter Swinburn finds it hard to believe Zilzal will ever be beaten and the son of Nureyev will attempt to extend his sequence to six out of six in next month's Breeders' Cup Mile in FloridaThe good news is that he will not be rushed off to stud afterwards and will campaign for further honours next year when a move up to a mile and a quarter might be consideredMeanwhileas Ladbrokes shortened Nashwan's odds for next Sunday's Prix de l'Arc de
