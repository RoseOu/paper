FoodThe test of a true boarBritish gourmets could soon go the whole hogwrites Henrietta GreenBy HENRIETTA GREENWILD BOAR once roamed the fields and forests of BritainThey were the sport of rich noblemen who hunted and ate them with terrific enthusiasm until there were noneNow there are plans afoot to reintroduce them to Britain on a grand scale for the gourmetmarketNot as wild boar running free and doing untold damage to the countrysideas in ItalyFrance and Germanybut as farmed wild boar which should ease your mindeven if it causes the farmers untold headachesThus it waslast Fridaythat the inaugural meeting of the British Wild Boar Association took placeIt was heldappropriatelyon the first day of Michaelmas whenin medieval timespigs were traditionally turned out into the woods to fatten up on acornsIt got off to a hairy start with several heated discussions about what a wild boar isDoes wildmean how it is keptCan it be farmed intensively or should it only be reared extensivelyDoes the name cover only pure-bred wild boars or can it include a crossbred with a domestic pigIf crosses are to be allowedwhat percentage of cross is acceptableAnd just because it looks like a wild boar with the striped marking or agoutilong snoutstraight tail and small pointy earscan it be accepted as such without a genetic testPretty technical stuff thiswith enough contentious issues to make every boar farmer's hair curlAs Robert Spencer Bernardbarrister and part-time farmer of wild boar for several years on his Buckinghamshire estatesaidA tiger is a tiger whether you see it in the London Zoo or in the Indian forestsbut with a wild boar the argument isn't so simpleWe had been herded together to discuss this and other issues by Dr Derek Boothanimal geneticist and scientistEasily recognised by his boar's head tiehis enthusiasm and appetite was first whetted when he met the iron-agepig several years agoA cross between a wild boar and Tamworth pigit was bred for a BBC TV series in an attempt to recreate animals from that eraDr Booth was admittedly horrified by the amount of fat it carriedand it was not until he saw wild boar in a wild life park in France that he realised the opportunitiesClearly Sam Weller had also seen the lightA self-proclaimed poineer and the first man to go the whole hogwith his businessthe Wild Boar Companyhe was all for setting the strictest standards of breedsoffering a product aimed at the luxury endof the marketCross breeds do produce some excellent porkbut it's not wild boar and it shouldn't be sold as suchHe believes that even when farmedwild boar must be genetically pure and reared in conditions which approximate the wild as closely as possibleAn animal's environmentthe food it eatsthe rigours of its existence and its genetic make-up may all affect the taste and texture of its fleshBut what we don't knowSam Weller told meis the relevant importance of those factorsResearch was then produced by Jeff Woods from the Institute of Food Research which backed up part of Sam Weller's argumentA cross-bred boar was reared and fed indoors in a penunder identical conditions to a domestic pigand the meats from the two carcasses tasted exactly the sameClearly environment and diet do determine the tasteWhen kept outside and left to roameating a varied diet and developing plenty of muscleboars will taste different from the domestic pigBut what no one seemed prepared or able to tell was to what extent the purity of breed influences the taste of boarAs one cynical farmer whispered knowinglyIf they're not carefulthey'll price themselves right out of the market with their boring pure-bred boarsThat'll leave it wide open for the supermarket boys to market a free-range acorn-fed porkan intensively bred pigfattened up in woods in half the time and costing well under an eighth of the priceNot a bad ideabut if the British Wild Boar Associationalready bristling with problemsis to combat that threat it must sort out its standardsIf you do manage to buy wild boarI suggest you try making hamburgersThis recipe is adapted from Patricia Lousada's satisfying Game Cookery John Murray£15.95It reminds me of

are deserting Billingsgate market to buy direct from the portssays Deirdre McQuillanBy DEIRDRE MCQUILLANI do like to be able to pick a fish up by its headWilliam Black saidwaving a sea bass in rigor mortis at mebefore going on to inspect its gillsHe makes a bleary-eyed and disorientating living between Rungisthe wholesale fish market on the south side of Parisand Londonwhere he supplies fish to restaurants such as Tante ClaireAlistair Little and SuntoryHis is just one example of the new enterprises supplying fish to shops or restaurants that cut out Billingsgate marketfor they also cut out the 25 per cent or so that trading through the market adds to the cost of fishIndependent fishmongers often buy directly from the ports using Billingsgatethe central wholesale market for shops and restaurants across the whole of southern Englandas a back-upIf they don't get their finger outthey will lose almost all their business to the direct tradeis Jim Moran's succinct analysis of the market's futureFrom a family of fish merchantshe has served on Billingsgate committees and all but despairs of them ever getting on with the real business of selling fishHe estimates that the market handles only 50 per cent of the trade in fresh fish in southern EnglandMr Moran added to that decline when his Billingsgate-based merchant businessR W Larkinopened a swanky new fishmonger in London's King's Road to which fish is delivered from port agents around Britainand also from BoulogneAs wholesalers we felt that Billingsgate was not offering us the facilities we neededhe explainsWe still trade from therebut in order to thrive we have had to look at better ways of sellingThe shop has two aimsOne is to see if adventurous buyinglavish displays and good service which includes opening until 7pm and for a half-day on Sundaywill galvanise the publicThe other is to provide a more convenient location for restaurant customersChefs don't want to get up at six in the morning to go to DocklandsMr Moran saysAlthough it seems that the South is recovering its appetite for fresh fishwith restaurants buying about 30 per cent of the fish sold in the areathere is no doubt that there has been a positive nosedive in the demand for fresh fish in Britain as wholeSales have fallen by as much as 60 per cent in the last 40 yearsAs a resultfishmongers have disappearedtheir numbers dropped from 9,000 in 1971 to 3,000 in 1981A recent report on fish retailingcompiled by the market research company Keynoterecords the number of wet fish shops in the south of England having declined by 60 per cent in 27 yearsSince the days when oysters were as everyday a dish as hamburgers are nowwe have reached a point where each person eats only an average of 1.2oz of fresh fish a weekBillingsgate has presided over this decline with all the grace of an oligarchy that sees its power decliningIt has stuck to an antiquated way of operating that harks back to the days of guild powerand has refused to countenance criticismTransport arrangements within the market are strictly regulatedPorters must be hired to move any amount of fishhowever smalland minders paid to look after customers' trucksNo prices are written down and there is no competitive biddingAll a buyer gets to see are the sample boxes opened on the trading flooron the strength of which he negotiates with the merchantThis is how markets operate the world overbut distrust of Billingsgate's dealing seems to be a problemNicholas Roea writer who used to be a fishmongersaysI seemed to spend more time sending fish back than selling itI had to move further and further back down the line to the boatsHorror stories aboundof the rogue's law that prevented any port agent who sold directly to fishmongers from ever trading with a Billingsgate merchant againof the nepotism that determined who could have a stand in the marketand of prices that varied according to who you were and whether you had a good introductionThese stories are commonplacealthough those involved are wary of going on recordOn trips organised for food writerspublic perfidy is a popular lamentThe shopperso the refrain goesdoesn't know how to cook fresh fishcan't cope with boneswon't pay a fair price and will only be persuaded to buy the traditional speciesThe traditional fishmonger wasn't up to much eitherapparentlyselling the same varieties of fish to the same ageing customersNow it is the turn of Billingsgate to feel anxiousalthough according to Lou Hartchairman of the London Fish Merchants' AssociationBillingsgate has nothing to fearWe offer an unrivalled serviceNo one else has the range of fishThe porterage system is antiquated but it works efficientlyIf we could think of a better system we would introduce itCustomers are coming back to Billingsgate because they know what they are gettingProblems with short weights are being tackled and if fish has been on the market overnightthe person buying it is awareContrary to what people thinkwe are well prepared for 1992We are going to be ahead of any market in EuropeTraipsing around after William Black through the coldwet trading floors of Rungishoweverit was immediately apparent that the size of the Paris operation and the variety of fish dwarfed LondonRefrigerated juggernauts from all over Europe wait outside the doorsHe explained that on the Continent it is taken for granted that fish caught on a line by small boats should command a premium for the careful handling that preserves both flavour and textureBritish fishermen are beginning to use lines rather than netsbut they are selling to the Continent because they'd be daft not toIt must sometimes be the case that I bring British fish back to Londonbut it will probably be in better condition than if it had been bought there as foreign agents insist on good transport and packingWe stopped at one of his regular suppliers and cadged a few sea urchinsthen the knife to eat them withFish is such wonderful stuffso perishable and so delicateenthuses Mr Blackwaving at the glorious display of shellfish all around usIt is not treated by the trade in Britain with anything like the respect it is given in FranceIn the fish business1992 has already arrivedThere is one market across Europe and the prices the Germans and Italians will pay are even surprising the FrenchThey will pay whatever it takes to get Scots crayfish and Dublin Bay prawns into the shops and restaurants in beautiful conditionwhen no one back home can be botheredThat is why I prefer to work from hereAs an examplehe opened a case of red mullet the fashionable restaurant fish of the moment which he had just boughtNow this is packed in three-kilo boxesfilled properly with ice of just the right sizeLarge lumps bruise the skinThe mullet have been carefully interleaved in the boxrather than shoved inIf I bought red mullet in EnglandI would probably get a two-stone cardboard boxTwo stone is really too large to handle carefully and as for cardboard and ice wellyou can imagineThe quality of the ice and the arrangement of the fish would be far more haphazard and soby the time the fish are deliveredtheir stomachs will have splitAlex GriffithsMarks & Spencer's fish executivewas surprised at the idea that the company might have even contemplated using Billingsgate when it began selling fresh fish nationally four years agoI go to the market regularly to see what is happeninghe saysbut our entire trading policy is based on building relations with suppliersOur suppliers buy direct from the portsprepare and pack the fish for us and then we have it on the shelves within 24 hoursWe stipulate temperature and handling at every stageGoing though another stage would mean a loss of controlWith restaurantssupermarketswholesalerssingle fishmongers and foreign buyers all scrabbling for the best fishthe implications for Billingsgate are clearIn the opinion of Tim Lucasa director of the wholesale company SimsonBillingsgate isshall we saya little tiredThere has been such a growth in direct dealing that fish is only getting sent to Billingsgate when no one else wants itBut Jim Moran believes Billingsgate has already found its nicheBillingsgate is a good place for cheap fishhe saysThere is a need for fish that has been on the market a couple of daysIt is not the image which people like you want to know aboutbut it is trueThe British like cheap foodNicholas Roe concluded our conversation rather surprisingly by sayingBillingsgate is a really tough environmentyou work long hours and grow old quicklyYou shouldn't be too hard on itIt seems all the more of a waste if those longcold hours only result in stale fishDrinkDesire in search of a nameDo the French have the mot justeto

start over pickled brisket sandwiches and chips on fine evenings outside the deliThe less pubescent diner can cast a detached eye on this ritual from six Formica-topped tables inside the tiny deli-restaurantAlthough Laps has now passed out of the benign hands of David and Lotte Lapiduswho ran it for some 50 yearsthe tradition lives on as does the style of cuisinebest described by the Yiddish word hamischNothing fancy and lots of itPickled brisket and chopped and fried fish are the specialitiesalthough at times Laps bizarrely mixes the Eastern European tradition with that of south

Tues-Thur 5.30pm-11pmSun 11.30am-3pmFoodFeast of indelicate ediblesChaim Bermant hankers for herringsBy CHAIM BERMANTDELICATESSENas the name suggestsmeans delicate ediblesbut delicate these edibles are notThey assault the sensesavage the palateravage one's innards and announce themselves in loudpungent terms so that one gets wind of them long before one catches sight of themBut I love themBasically they are titbits and are designed to excite the appetite rather than assuage itAs food they are meant principally for the non-hungrythe non-domesticatedthose who can just summon the energies to open a tin of pate de foie gras or unwind a rollmopI was born in what is now Russiaand when I came to Scotland shortly before the war the small Jewish grocery shops in the Gorbals district of Glasgow were my main link with homeI still remember their namesIxe'sFogelsEttingersCallendarsAnd their wareshugesteaming loaves of black Russian breadglossy bagelscrispy pretzelscinnamon cakeslongcrudely circumcised phallic rolls of salamipickled gherkins and their hallmark open barrels of salt herringsI only had to shut my eyes and inhale and I was back in RussiaTo me delicatessen means herring1,001 varieties of herringbut I did not always regard them as such if only because I virtually lived on themThe herring was to the Eastern European Jew what potatoes were to the Irishwhich is surprisingfor the herring is a salt-water fish and in Russia and Poland one rarely got a glimpse of the seaBut Jews know a good thing when they taste it and alighted on the herring because it was inexpensivepiquantnutritious and versatileThe herring was never quite considered a member of the fish familyThe carp and pikewhich were found locallywere kitted out with lavish trimmings and served on the Sabbath and at festivalsThe humble herring was treated as crude workaday fareand in our household we might have pickled herring on Sundaysoused herring on Mondayherrings in sour cream on Tuesdayschmaltz herring on Wednesdayand herrings fried in matzo meal on ThursdayWhen we moved to Scotland I discovered the greatest delicacy of all the smoked herringor kipperI am sure the warm affinities between Scots and Jews arise out of appreciation of herringsI also came upon a mysterious animal I had not seen beforemuch larger than the herringredder and infinitely more expensiveThey called it smoked salmon and I immediately concluded it was some sort of rich man's herringThe Gorbals is no more and neither are the small Jewish grocery shopsOne is hard pressed even to find them in LondonInstead one has delicatessens which are more brightly lit and infinitely more hygienic than the small corner shops I have knownbut with their fridges and freezers and extraction fans they have tamed their wares and robbed them of their pungencyOne's sense of smellalways deeply involved in the joy of the delicatessenhas been rendered virtually redundantBut more than thatall the goodsand especially the innumerable varieties of herringhave gone upmarketIf salmon is still the rich man's herringone can no longer think of herrings as the poor man's salmon for they have become so expensive that one buys them by the troy ounceAll of which shows that one man's staple is another man's delicatessen orratherthat the necessities of one generation can become the luxuries of the next
