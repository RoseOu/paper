Cambridge at Twickenham in just under three weeksSloppy handlingpoor co-ordination and a lackadaisical defence left them well adrift of Major R V Stanley's XV at Iffley Road yesterdayAny match of nine tries five by Stanley'sis bound to be entertaining but Oxford committed so many errors in every department that it was hard to keep a straight face while assessing their contributionIn addition their captain Brian Smith persisted with his wayward goal-kicking long after it became apparent that he should pass the task to someone elsePerhaps it was asking too much of Oxfordwho have not won a game for a monthto exercise the same shrewd control at half-back demonstrated by Farr-Jones and PortaInjuries to key players have hampered their preparations and possibly undermined confidenceIn contrast Stanley's usually made the inspired calculations of a good invitation side out for a scoring spreeAlthough they lost the Australian wing Ian Williams with a shoulder injury early ontheir back division was outstandingespecially Mullin and the Canadian full-back Gareth ReesFarr-Jones was clearly in a mood to enjoy himself before joining the Barbarians to take on the All Blacks at Twickenham on SaturdayStanley's took the lead after two minutes with an opportunist try by Mullinwhen Porta's attempted drop goal rebounded from a postEight minutes later Mullin's perceptive cross-kick found Rees

entertaining tie at the City Ground when Lee Chapman won the match seven minutes from the endWhile there was nothing extraordinary about the goalChapman turning in a free-kick Clough had driven through a crowd of players towards the near postthe reason the free-kick was awarded left Everton disgruntledTheir goalkeeperNeville Southallwas preparing to clear the ball upfield and making no haste about it when the refereeGeorge Tysonbooked him for time-wasting and awarded Forest the indirect free-kick which was to decide the matchNot for the first time this season MrTyson needed a police escort as protesting losers surrounded him at the endEvertonstill without their regular centre-backs Ratcliffe and Watson because of injuryagain tried to make up for this by playing Snodin as a spare centre-back behind Keown and McDonaldThis gave them a cushion of safety but often meant that the opposition found it easier to make space in midfieldHoweverit also meant that the sort of movements which normally flow through Clough had to be accurate to the point of perfection if they were not to be enmeshed in blue shirtsTwo minutes before the half-hour Forest appeared to have achieved this when Pearce exchanged passes with Clough and burst clear into the penalty area on the leftSouthallwho had earlier blocked a close-range shot from the England left-back taken from a similar anglelooked more vulnerable this time but Pearce drove the ball past the far postWith so many players forced to defendEverton found few opportunities to attack in any strengthHowevera free-kick from Nevin nearly brought them a goal immediately before Pearce should have given Forest the leadKeown nodded Nevin's kick square and Newell's diving header drew a smart save from Crossleyhis first of the gameCrosby's acceleration and close control were a frequent worry to Everton on the right but seven minutes before half-time the winger only seemed to have got past Snodin by fouling himThe refereehoweverallowed

Oldham doubts were dispelledRitchie passed to Irwin and then ran on to head the cross past LukicArsenal were stitched and stuffedwith no question of a flukeNot for the first time this season their defence had been found wanting and Oldham exploited the weaknesses to the fullowing a special debt to the inspiration and tireless running of Henry and MilliganGeorge Graham was not amusedHe called his team's performance unacceptableBut he also saidLet's not take any credit away from OldhamThey were tremendousand outplayed us in the first halfThe plastic pitch is no excuseWe trained on an artificial pitch for two days this week and we should have done a lot betterJoe Roylethe Oldham managerwas full of praise both for Graham and his own teamGeorge was brillianthe saidHe could have

of the competition last night in unusual andEverton would claimunjust circumstancesNottingham Forest had almost despaired of breaking down Everton's rebuilt defence when Lee Chapman won an entertaining fourth-round tie at the City Ground with a smartly taken goal seven minutes from the endWhile there was nothing extraordinary about the goal itselfChapman turning the ball in at the near post after Clough had driven an indirect free-kick low through a crowd of playersthe circumstances in which the kick had been given were a little odd and left Everton looking apoplecticNeville Southallwhose saves had prevented Forest running away with the game in the first halfgathered the ball and started to think about clearing it but in the view of the refereeGeorge Tysonhe had thought too longA bemused Southall found himself cautioned for time-wasting and a few seconds later had to pick the ball out of the netNot for the first time this season Tyson needed a police escort at the end as he was surrounded by protesting playersColin Harveythe Everton managerushered his team awayThe TV playback showed that Southall had held the ball for 13 secondsalthough it did not seem as long at the timeHarvey said later that he thought the decision had been harsh and added that there had been no warning given about time-wasting before the gamealthough he accepted that Tyson could have mentioned it to the players during the matcha fact confirmed by the referee as he left the groundJust over a fortnight ago two of Tyson's more controversial penalty decisions had help spark a free-for-all at the end of the League match between Arsenal and Norwich City which led to both clubs being charged with bringing the game into disreputeOn the balance of last night's playEverton were entitled to feel that they had done enough to take Forest back to Goodison ParkAlthough they were still deprived by injury of their regular central defenders Ratcliffe and Watsonthey managed to defend efficiently by using Snodin as a spare centre-back behind Keown and McDonaldEven this appeared unlikely to stop Nottingham Forest in the first halfHodge and Parker commanded the midfieldCrosby and Ricestrongly supported by Laws and Pearcedrove forward on the flanks and it seemed only a matter of time before the right sort of cross reached Chapman or CloughNottingham Forest later lost their momentum and McCall and Sheedy were now able to establish lasting contact with Newell and SharpCrossley had to move quickly to save a glancing header from Sharp and just when it looked as if Forest might be more grateful for a replay Chapman won the tieJust what constitutes time-wasting is a matter for the referee's discretionand if Tyson felt that Southall was deliberately using up precious seconds he was entitled to award Forest that crucial free-kickBut everybody knows thatin other games at other times with oter refereesgoalkeepers will dally and dawdle to a greater degree and get away with itTo be effective this kind of refereeing has to be consistentOtherwise the letter of the law is an assNottingham
