In good faith Open SpaceTHE Gospel TruthNovember 28was interesting for the assumptions its authorJayne Greenwelldeemed to be factsFor exampleNo child of practising religious parents will miss out on religious education it will be provided at homeWho says soIt may be provided at Sunday school but I would think that the average Christian parents have the same feeling of unease about discussing faith with the children as they do about discussing sexJayne Greenwell also assumes that the existence of God is not a fact but a matter of opinionThe truth is that people don't react to realitythey react to their perception of realityMy perception of God is real and I can understand that for her he isn'tWhat I can't understand is who she thanks when she wants to be thankfulfor example when her son was bornIf God is not a factthen what have atheists to fear if their kids learn about himIf something is nothinghow can it affect anythingTerry Wynn Member of the European Parliament Merseyside EastAS SOMEONE involved in religious educationI share Jayne Greenwell's concernbut cannot agree with her solution that RE be taken out of the curriculumIt is too important in that it enables children to understand how religion influences individuals and societiesand to explore how people form their own beliefs and values including atheismHoweverI would denounce the kind of RE she describes because it imposes beliefs rather than explores themIn this respect it contradicts the approach to education in general which is to enable children to acquire critical skills and achieve the kind of understanding that makes knowledge their ownnot that of their parents or societyWays of teaching RE to young children have received too little attentionand teachers are given woefully little training consequently the one mentioned in the article is probably left to teach as she was once taughtW Owen Cole ChichesterIWOULD urge Jayne Greenwell not to be concerned about her son's religious instructionMy sonaged fourbelieves in God and Jesusas I did as a childHe also believes in fairieswitchessea monsters and Father ChristmasI am confident that when he reaches his teens he will challenge and possibly reject religion as he will earlier have rejected his other fantasiesIt was an aphorism of my parents-in-law that in order to respond to the arguments of the religious persuadersit was essential to be thoroughly familiar with the content of the bibleSo don't worryMs Greenwellyour son's religious education lessons will provide him with the ammunition that he needs to oppose traditional religious beliefsJane P Sutherland ReadingJAYNE Greenwell overlooks the fact that Christianity is the soil in which the roots of the ethnic British are groundedMost of the praise-worthy efforts to reflect minority cultures in our schools are based on religious festivals HinduMoslemSikh or JewishOur children have a right to know why we have Christmas and Eastercrosses on war memorials and a coronation servicewhy the centre of every English village is a parish churchand why English literature resonates with Biblical imageryThey have even more of a right to know if they are not being told at homeThis is not the same as force-feedingdoctrineone can sympathise with Jayne Greenwell's reservationsbut we should be careful what gets thrown out with the bathwaterAnne Kiggell EditorPrep School London SW14 PAGE womAnother dayDecember 71786I am in a fair way of becoming as eminent as Thomas a Kempis or John Bunyanand you may expect henceforth to see my birthday inserted among the wonderful events in the Poor Robin's and Aberdeen Almanacksalong with the black Monday and the battle of Bothwell BridgeRobert Burns to Gavin HamiltonLetters193l
