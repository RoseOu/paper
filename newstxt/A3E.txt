first of a series for novice gardenersAnna Pavord stresses the value of careful forethoughtBy ANNA PAVORDPLANTS should come a long way down the list of priorities for the novice gardenerThere are many things to think about before even the first tentative daffodil bulb is sunk into the groundThe first and most important question to mull over as you gaze at your patch isWhat is this garden forIf you start writing down some of the responses to that questionyou will find you have along the way acquired a ragbag of elements that will have an important bearing on the designIf there are small children in the equationthere will need to be a flatsoft area where they can fall off swings and climbing framesIf you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the bowels of an expensive machineyou will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from itSome novice gardeners may not want to do much actual gardening at allbut converselydo not want to look out every day over a scene of threadbare grass and rotting fenceTheir ideal garden will look good and demand little attentionIf you are a dedicated sun-worshipperyou need to mark out the part of the garden where the sun lingers longestIt may not be the part nearest the housethough this is where sitting out areas always tend to be madeYou mayeven as a novicecare so passionately about plants that all you want is the maximum space to grow them inRaised beds built down an unpromising alley could provide extra gardening spacePrivacy is an important considerationA first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one I am imagining for this series is no more than 40ft x 20ft and surrounded on all sides by other housesPrivacy is a ticklish business where close neighbours are concernedTo throw up an impenetrable Berlin Wall between you and them could be tactlessTrellis is a useful compromise and you can always pretend it was forced on you by the speed of growth of your climbing roseAesthetes among the novices will by now be thoroughly irritable and complaining that gardens should have as much to do with the soul as with the necessity or not of a washing line or a barbecue pitSo they shouldand when the list of necessities is securely written downyou can ask the second questionHow do I want this garden to feelThis question produces as varied a response as the firstSome urban gardenersas short of space inside as they are outwant their gardens to be extensions of their homeswith a great deal of hard pavinggood furniture and lightingThe garden for them should feel like an extra sitting roomgnat-ridden perhapsdamp occasionallybut an important overflow of living spaceCloset countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some Sussex meadow and picture it swagged with honeysuckle and waving with ox-eye daisies and scabiousThis is a difficult trick to bring off with suburban trains hurtling by on one side and lorries grinding through their gears on the otherA leafy retreat is an excellent goal for a small town gardenbut it is best made acknowledging the urban settingusing un-wild plants such as bambooacanthusfigvinealchemillaeuphorbiawisteriaWhile you are working through this processtake note of the features in the garden that you would like to keepOn a new estatethere may be nothingIn an old gardenthere may be a fruit treeor a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box thattidied upcould add a dash of venerability to the new garden that will emerge around itIf you do not know what a tree or shrub isexercise clemency and give it a year's grace to demonstrate its worth before you turn it over to the axemanThe mood of the garden will dictate its eventual styleIt may be clipped classicalrandom cottagemodern high-techor some intensely personal vision of Byzantiumthat no one has ever imagined beforebut which exists in your head and wants to get outDo not let anybodyparticularly gardening writerstread on your dreamsAll this thinking and doodling will have done nothing physically to change the view outside the windowbut it is a vital part of the gardening processBefore you can makeyou have to know what it is you are makingIn the GardenDrawing the line at great designAnna Pavord delves into a book that reveals the gardens architects have imagined could accompany their creationsBy ANNA PAVORDTHE drawings of the Royal Institute of British Architects form one of the less well-known collections in LondonArchitectural historians have already raided it to good effectnotably Mark Girouard for his book on the sixteenth-century architect Robert Smythson and Jill Leverthe curator of the collectionfor the book she wrote with Margaret RichardsonThe Art of the ArchitectJane Brown is the latest to emerge triumphant from the RIBA library in Portman Square with The Art and Architecture of English Gardens Weidenfeld & Nicolson£40She looks at the collection with a view to its bearing on garden historyHer book is not a comprehensive history of English garden designbut a much chancierthough equally delightful narrative depending for its emphasis on what happened to find its way into the collectionThese quirks of fatecombined with Jane Brown's own enthusiasms she is the author of a fine book on the Lutyens-Jekyll partnershiphave resulted in a narrative in which the gardens of the Arts and Crafts movementa relatively short period between 1890-1914get twice the space of the gardens of either the eighteenth or the nineteenth centuryThis is fine by meThe talented crew of VoyseyNewtonBaillie Scottwho created the beautifully put together houses of that periodevidently also had the gift of persuasively selling their ideasWho could have resisted Charles Voysey's design for OakhurstRopes LaneFernhurst in SussexA pool of blue scillas lies to the left of an entrance through yew hedgesThe house is softened by sprawls of climbing rosesHollyhocks and wallflowers tower over the gaily filled flower borderHis clientMrs Chestersensibly did not resist and the house was built in 1901Oliver Hill's plan 1913for the paving of the water garden at Moor CloseBinfieldBerkshireshows staggering attention to detailRed tile set

planbeautifully drawn and letteredas are all the plans of this periodis particularly poignantNo architect gardeners came this way againThe story told in Jane Brown's book does not end with the Arts and Crafts movementhoweverIt continues with the relatively little known work of the Modern Movementcurtailed by the warthrough the idealistic beginnings of the Span housing estates in the mid-Fiftiesto Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe's plannow being executedfor the Moody Botanic Gardens at GalvestonTexasSixteen drawings for this massive project form the book's final chapter Towards the 21st CenturyAfter this chronological march through the archivesJane Brown devotes the second part of her weighty book to the delightfully rich seam of garden buildings and ornament designed over the last 400 yearsHere is Sir Jeffry Wyatville's design for a Swiss Cottage to be built at the Duke of Bedford's rural retreatEndsleighDevonThe bijou rustic pavilionas he describes itstill survives and has recently been restored by the Landmark TrustHere too is Lutyens's design for a fowl housea wooden building perched on staddle stones with lantern and a thatched roofa residence to please the most demanding chickenArchitectural drawings may seem dry fodder to provide the stuff of an exciting bookJane Brown's gift is to vault the divide that has unfortunately grown up between architects and the rest of us and bring their drawings alive in the most agreeable and informative wayOne does not always agree with herShe commends Barry for his ability to build well and to lastbut Barry's work at Kingston Lacey in Dorset and elsewhere was outrageously shoddyShe credits the Crystal Palace built by Joseph Paxton for the Great Exhibition in 1851 as the inspiration for later conservatories and the whole future of growing plants indoorsThe revolution in glasshouses had surely started rather earlier than that with the radical design built in 1820 by W&D Bailey of Holborn for Lady Rolle at Bicton in DevonBut these are quibblesand in no way detract from Jane Brown's achievementThis is a fascinating book
