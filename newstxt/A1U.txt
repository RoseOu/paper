PCBs explainedFrom Dame MARY DONALDSONGBEPCBs polychlorinated biphenyls are very inert organic substanceswhich were prized because they were flexible being liquidsbut had very high insulating properties for electricityThey were also used in hydraulic systems because they did not react with the materials used in the pipes and pistonsThey do not occur naturallybut were produced commercially for 50 yearsbeginning in 1929They are extremely hard to dispose ofIncinerationwhich claims a 99.999 per cent destruction rateis the only known way of eliminating themBut PCBs are a disappearing problemIn the late Seventies many countriesincluding the UK in 1978banned their manufactureRemaining stocks in electrical equipmentmostlyare being burnedbut traces will remain for many yearsPCBs are now ubiquitous at very low levels in the environmentin both town and countryThey are found at about 0.05 parts per million in Northern EuropeThe concentrations are very variablebut though there is evidence of their being at higher levels near cities and urban areasthere is no necessary connection with waste-disposal sitesAt least one study has suggested that high PCB levels in mothers' milk is linked with a higher-than-normal incidence of haemolytic diseasea blood disorderPCBs can create dioxins polychlorinated organic chemicals if they are burned at low temperaturesAnimal studies have shown dioxins to be carcinogenic and to cause birth defects in rats at very high dosesThere wasthereforegreat concern that PCBs should not be subject to inadequate heat treatmentThere is no evidence that dioxins any more than PCBs themselves are carcinogenic in humansBut medical opinion seems to hold that both should be treated as though they wereIn any casethe controlled combustion of PCBs must be a diminishing source of the national load of dioxin pollutionGovernment research says that the presence of dioxins in flue gases from plants such as that at Pontypool are in the low range of parts per trillionone part per trillion is of the order of 30 seconds in a million yearsor one ounce in 28 million tonsand that all the UK PCB-destroying plants together emit only a few grammes per yearAgeing municipal domestic waste incinerators are a far greater source of dioxins and are slowly being upgradeddomestic fires and unleaded petrol are the next biggest sourcesPCBsThe incineratorsFrom Dame MARY DONALDSONGBETHE incineration of PCBs requires a furnace which will hold the material at 1,100C for at least two secondsin the presence of plenty of oxygenCompanies wishing to enter the waste disposal business at this level must demonstrate to the local Waste Disposal Authority usually a county councilbut in some cities and in Wales a more local authoritythat they can meet various criteriaalthough the authority may be over-ruled on appeal to the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution is now the custodian of national standards on emissions from such plantsof which Britain currently has threeRechem can take solid and liquid wastes contaminated with PCBs at its plant at Pontypool 30,000 tonnes a yearand liquid wastes 20,000 tonnes a yearat its plant at Fawleynear SouthamptonCleanaway can take liquid PCBs at its Ellesmere Port establishmentwhere it is building another plant which will take capacity there to 48,000 tonnes annuallyOcean Environmental Management has applied for a 30,000-tonne plant at Seal SandsTeessideand is appealing against the local authority's refusal to allow itLeigh Environmental wants to build an incinerator plant near Doncasterbut also faces local authority oppositionand International Technology Corporation has submitted a joint application with Northumbrian Water for incinerators at Teesside and Tyneside for the incineration of sewage sludge and organic wasteswith a capacity of 43,000 tonnes eachThe figures quoted are for a mix of wastes requiring incinerationOnly a fraction is PCB-contaminated materialthe bulk of the load must be wastes with a higher calorific value for the incinerator to workAbout 80,000 tonnes of waste for incineration or treatment is imported every yearas against the five million tonnes which England and Wales produceAll these incinerators offer what is called merchant capacitythey sell their facilities to dispose of other people's wastebut do not produce the waste themselvesThere are no in-house incinerators licensed to take PCBsthough many firms run incinerators which can take simpler chemical wastesThere are a few merchant facilities licensed to take dangerous organic wasteswhich are nonetheless not the worst-case highly chlorinated wastes one of these is the Leigh plant at Killamarsh near SheffieldPCBsWhat Rechem says about PontypoolFrom Dame MARY DONALDSONGBEHIGH-temperature incineration converts the carbon and hydrogen in organic chemicals into carbon dioxide and waterMany of these chemicals also contain chlorinewhich is converted to common salt in the gas-cleaning plantStack emissionswhich are continuously monitoredmeet the strictest standards in the worldPCBs are used as a markerto measure the incinerator efficiencybecause they are very stable organic compoundsMeasurements taken over many years show that levels of PCBs in grass and soil in the area impacted by the stack plume are indistinguishable from background levelsThe stack emission comfortably meets the American standard for breathing airThe stack plume is normally barely visible but appears more prominent at nightwhen lower ambient temperatures lead to increased condensation of the water vapourThe water used by the gas-cleaning plant is cooled by a cooling tower which itself emits two water-vapour plumesthe density of which varies according to climatic conditionsThe quality of these plumes is well within the American PCB standard for breathing airThe inert ash removed from the incinerator and the filter cake produced from the solids washed from the combustion gases are landfilled with a PCB content less than normal background soil levelsThe water effluent from the cleaning process is discharged to sewer with a PCB content less than the level in the blood of the general populationFinallythe air leaving site is continuously monitored to show that there are no significant chemical releasesThe PCB content is less than one-fiftieth of the American breathing air standardUnfortunatelybecause of mankind's carelessness with PCBs in the pastthey are already ubiquitousBy destroying these wastes Rechem is significantly helping to prevent further pollution of the local and world environmentAn atmosphere poisoned by mistrustBy NICHOLAS ROEThe disposal of toxic wastes is one of the most intractable problems facing industrialised societiesEven though some of the most dangerous and persistent toxinsincluding polychlorinated biphenylsPCBsare no longer manufacturedquantities of them still existand must be got rid ofBut howAnd whereOn this pageNick Roe visits a plant whichdespite strenuous public relations effortshas failed to convince its neighbours that it has come cleanAnd Richard North looks at current provisions for the destruction of PCBsand at the history of British involvement in a rather uncomfortable growth industry The security guard at the entrance to one of Britain's mightiest hazardous waste disposal plants pressed a button and the gate openedThen he pressed another knob and a big toy doll in his office window dropped its trousersYou had to laughYet this was Rechem International's high-temperature incineration plant at Pontypool in GwentSouth WalesHardly a laughing mattersurelyBeyond the barrier lay some of the most toxic chemicals knownawaiting destruction by fireWhat elseA vastsmoke-blackened furnace100 people to do the workmassive investment the company spent £2m last year on cleaning up smoke emissionsPlus a backdrop of houses covering the valley walls on either sidea reminder that wherever industrialised societies decide to deal with their most intractable problemsthey are unlikely to find a place to do so which is not in somebody's back yardBritain grinds out almost five million tonnes of hazardous waste each yearof which about 63,000 tonnes are so difficult to store or treat that they are burnt at high temperatures here in Gwent or at one of three other centresEllesmere PortFawleynear Southamptonand the unfortunately named Killamarshnear SheffieldFive more incinerators currently proposed in various parts of the country will double capacityThen there are the imports83,000 tonnes of toxic waste enter British ports annually for incineration or other treatmenta figure which has increased 20-fold in just eight yearsIn these environmentally conscious timesthis is an uncomfortable growth industryLiverpool dockers recently turned back parts of a 1,500-tonne consignment of Canadian PCBs polychlorinated biphenylsbound for this plant in GwentIn doing sothey underlined a fact which is likely to attract more and more attention as tankers continue to shift toxins from town to towncountry to countrythe waste chain is longIt snakes in and out of portsalong our busiest highways and through our most crowded citiesAnxieties which are currently felt most acutely by those living near destruction plants themselves may not always remain so localisedAt Pontypoolthe collision between a precisescientific industry and a diffuseunscientific local suspicion is painfully apparentLocal people mutter and marchmake speeches and throw thingsstaff face sarcasm in nearby pubsand for years there have been demands for a public inquiryRechem has responded with a rather desperate open-door policy aimed at soothing fearsand more recently by issuing about a dozen writs against the fiercest criticsWe are an aggressive companyadmitted David Wheeleroperations director at this plant and at Rechem's other incineratorat FawleyFor a place so hatedthe Pontypool plant looks innocuous insidelike a cross between an oil refinery and a crematoriumMr Wheeleran engineer who worked for many years in the oil businessis a pleasantslightly worried-looking man who cannot bear the fact that no one seems to realise just what lengths he goes to in order to keep the plant squeaky clean and emission-freeIn hard hats and protective glasseswe walked past the huge fume cupboardwhere the most noxious barrels are openedand arrived at the vastclosed mouth of the furnace itselfIt was hotbut not burningThere was a fault on the computer governing the plantsaid Mr Wheelerand the fire had automatically shut downThese pipes stretching thinly in a bridge across the service road injected a mix of chemicals into the walls of the furnace itselfdid I know that fuel was only used in the start-up processafter which the chemicals themselves provided the fireWorkers in blue overalls drifted around us and cracked jokes in gentle Welsh accentsIn the furnace control office I found shift foreman Keith Thomas and asked innocently if he had any physical problemsNot since my vasectomyA grinHe lived locallyso how did neighbours view his job hereYou get sarcasm mainlyA lot of my friends are pleased that the company is doing the job they are doingOthers are not so well informedYou couldn't hope to convert themAt a nearby houseLeonard Hougha retired schoolmasterhad earlier told me about the fogwhich he says comes from the factoryIt blows along the valleyThey've improved the chimney recently and it's very much better than it was but we still get the smellsAnd since they've refused repeatedly to have a public inquiry into what is going on there we're not certain of the safety of what's coming outWe get smoke from the steel works across the valleybut we know what that is and we're not afraid of itKeith Thomas pressed a button and a huge door clanked upwards so that I could peer into the heart of the furnacePiles of ruddy-brown ash lay heaped on the floorPumps sucked air inwardsHeat shone outIn herethey burn about 30,000 tonnes of chemicals a yeara quarter originating outside BritainThe waste arrives at the rate of up to seven tanker-loads every day that is seven lorries passing thousands of doorstepsRight herein this gaping mouthlies the end of the chainThe wastes include lindaneDDTout-of-date drugscarcinogenic chemicalsold cigars and even pornography a different kind of pollutionAbout 7,000 tonnes of the total waste is PCB-contaminatedPCBs are so difficult to destroythat Rechem's emission-monitoring systems are geared to detecting them on the grounds that if you destroy PCBs you destroy everythingThisof courseis a key pointIf you did not burn chemicals like PCBswhat else would you do with themThe seaThe earthWe are not in the business of polluting the environmentMr Wheeler insistedWe are on the side of the angelsEnvironmental organisationshoweverput the emphasis elsewhereThere is no incinerator which completely destroys toxic wastesMadeleine CobbingGreenpeace's toxics campaignertold meThe crux of our argument is that we don't need to have toxic wastes and the fact that plants like Rechem existproviding easy options for companiesis acting as a disincentive for companies to clean upBut another but what about the PCBs that already existAlthough they are no longer manufacturedthey are still presentfor example in electrical equipmentNo one could therefore call for the closure of incineration plants at a strokebecause noxious chemicals have to go somewhereSo a part of the argument switches to the kind of incinerators you allow while industry is forced to clean itself upAlsohow these should function and perhaps most important of all where you put themMr Wheelernow moving to the rear of the plant to show off the £2m smoke-cleaning sectionwhich had just broken downpointed out that his company achieved destruction of at least 99.9999 per cent of all materialsThe company's figures imply that when you have burnt 99.9999 per cent of a 30,000-tonne annual throughputa figure of 0.03 of a tonne remainsIn 1986according to Friends of the Eartha survey of the homes clustered on the surrounding hills found that three-quarters of 800 residents were opposed to the Rechem plantThe plant should be relocated because it's in the wrong placeLlew Smiththe local Euro-MPtold meIt is in a valley and in a highly populated areaWhat did Mr Wheeler make of thatIf we do it properly any spot is the right spothe insistedStack emissions of PCBs were below the American standard for breathing air 1,000 times lower than the British equivalentRegular soil and grass tests showed no difference between PCB contamination in the immediate area and elsewhere in Wales though there are no established safelevels for theseFive air-monitoring plants had been installed he took me to see themAnd here were drums of chemicalseach labelledeach with a job number to check against samplingAnd yet there are accidentsIn 1987aluminium melted in the furnacereacted with water and explodedsending a black cloud over nearby housesLaterdrums supposedly containing carcinogenic drugs were not opened for checking before burning for health reasonsand three were misdescribedTheytooreacted with waterand a plant operator was burned by a cloud of acid gasWe walked past a tanker where a huge man named Andy Matthews was pumping vinyl acetate into a 10,000-gallon vatwreathed in its sweetsickly smellI've been here two yearshe saidMy father was an industrial chemist and he said if you want to go and work for themgo and work for themWere there any spillagesHe shruggedNothing majorI might drop a pipe a little bit of a splashIn a largeprefabricated shed we wandered past stacks of 45-gallon drums of PCBstwo drums highabout 10 deepand there were contaminated transformers waiting to be cut up and roasted in the flamesBack along the waste chainthe Liverpool dockers who objected to the import of exactly this type of chemical should be aware that PCBs are moving about our roads all the timeThere was no difference between the liquid in these drums and the liquid in the cargoes they refused to touchIn Liverpoola dockers' spokesman with the Transport and General Workers Union admittedDrivers aren't happy handling some of these commoditiesbut at least a lorry-driver has more idea of what he is handling than a dockerwho could have a consignment and just not know what it isYet he did not oppose all toxic waste movement after allthe same union represents workers at Rechem itselfhe simply didn't like the idea that big industrial nations like Canada could dump their dirty problems on this country and his membersDriving awayI noticed that the vast chimney was still not functioningbut when I called at a neighbouring house a woman showed me videos she had taken of smoke coming from the plantsettling in her gardenCertainly the incinerator seems well controlledCertainly there is no scientific evidence that living nearby increases the risk of sicknessCertainlyMr Wheeler convinced me that his company was going to huge lengths to keep itself cleanWe must run it safely in the short term and long termhe saidbecause if people are able to demonstrate that we are causing an environment problem we will be shut downIn April 1985 a tanker spilled 200 litres of PCBs over the main Trans-Canada Highway on the border between Ontario and ManitobaA section of the road was shut for a week and motorists were warned to clean their cars and to dispose of the rags in plastic bagsPCBsThe relative risk of grilling a kipperBy RICHARD NORTHTHE most curious thing about the transport and incineration of PCB wastes is that they areamongst professionalsthe least controversial of all the problems they deal withIndeedthey see incineration as a solution to toxic waste whose usefulness should be employed on a greater range of materialsThe House of Commons Environment Committee which could be presumed to care about being popularthe House of Lords Science and Technology Committee which has more expertise and rather less concern with popularityand the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution which has most expertise of all and absolutely no interest in popularityhave all been robustly and consistently critical of most parts of the waste-disposal chainThey all endorse the technology of incineration used to destroy PCBsThe only variation is between those who say the provenance of the wastes is irrelevantand those who argue that imports of PCBs and other hazardous material should be discourgedbecause only a tough import policy will ensure that other countries build their own plantsDavid Millsthe erstwhile head of the Hazardous Chemical wing of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution HMIPand well known for his criticisms of the lack of effective policing of what he defends as largely sound rules says that placing high-temperature incinerators in some sort of hierarchy of risks is a terribly subjective businessBut Mr Millswho is now a director of Aspinwallsan environment consultancy firmgoes onBecause of what I knowI would be perfectly content to live next to any of the plants we haveThey are managed wellthey have appropriate technology and conduct an environmentally safe processIf you compare the transport of PCBs with that of a 5,000-gallon tanker of petrolor liquid petroleum gas or any of the hazardous chemicals which are routinely trundling about our roads PCBs are of a very low order of toxicity or riskPCBs were designed to be inertThey are not going to explode or burnThey are not a risk if you happen to come across them inadvertentlyCompare them with a tanker full of chemicals which are corrosivetaint water at minute levels and kill living organisms at low dosesPCBs aren't like thatWhat you have to do if there is an accident and there hasn't been onethank heavens is keep the spilled PCBs out of watercoursesbecause they would accumulate in the fat of organisms which came into contact with themBut that's not an acute riskit's a long-term riskMany other chemicals are far more highly reactiveprobably more toxiccertainly more flammableLookI can't say this strictlyas a scientistbut it is my feeling that a bonfiregrilling a kipper or lighting a cigarette all release greater concentrations of dioxins than you'd be likely to find at the end of the pipe of a properly run high-temperature incineratorDavid Mills says that there was increasing pressure in the early Seventies to see a higher percentage of waste materials incineratedThere was general anticipation of regulations which would insist that more difficult wastes were burned instead of being sent to landfillSoon there were 12 high-temperature merchant incineratorsof which four employed the highest technologyTo the regret of professionals such as David Millsthe regulations never materialised and the market for merchant incinerators fell awayMostexcept the PCB burnershave since closedThis chain of events suggests that Britain got into medium- and high-level waste technology earlybut then abandoned the middle tierIt also means that we now landfill wastes that should be incineratedBut one cannot have it both waysfor UK wastes the import of wastes for landfill is now outlawedthe options are landfill or incinerationand people local to either hate the one near themThere is another optionexportThe UK exports no wastesbut accepts them from countries which either have or should have the capacity to destroy their own chemical arisingsas scientists call waste productsThe Netherlandsfor exampleaccounts for 43.26 per cent of wastes imported to the UK for incineration or treatmentThere is PCB-burning capacity in SwedenFinlandGermany and Franceof which only the last islike Britainprepared to import such wasteCitizen protest is making the whole industry very cageygovernments are reluctant to allow planning permission or import licencesOn importsBritain has been uniquely robust in the face of protestLess determined countries export their waste and thus acquire an undeserved reputation for being greenIt is a matter of judgement whether CanadaAustralia and Japan should be able to dispose of their own PCBsAt presentnone of them canMargaret Thatcher will next month tell an international conference that the trade in wastes for incineration should be allowed where it is the best environmental option for existing wastesIn other wordskeep a legal route opensooner than see dumpingButsays a refinement of this view and Mrs Thatcher and Chris Pattenher Secretary of State for the Environment believe this too wastes should be disposed of in their country of originthat is a new drift in British policyIt is a proposal which would still leave small countriesand especially poor countrieswith a requirement to export wastesIt would also leave the neighbours of the incinerator plants exposed at least to UK wastesand probably to some importsThese people have fears which the media has shamelesslessly played on over the yearsbut which are genuineRechemwhich runs two of Britain's three plants equipped to incinerate PCB- contaminated wastessays that local politicians take various approachesThe firm claims a good relationship with its Fawley neighboursand has always said it regrets the difficulties with Torfaen council the local authority for PontypoolIt hints that it is politiciansnot disposal plantswhich make the two places differThere is a clear value in reducing the amount of chemical waste which has to be got rid of and that thinking has a long way to goWhat is not at all clear is whether one highly visible target incineration is anything like a major ingredient in the pollution cocktaileven at Pontypool
