Why Charlotte Du Cann hates the use of kids as accessories Hip families Fear and loathingYOU cannot look at anything these days without coming face to face with a picture of a blissful couple holding a babyThe baby is the accessory of the momentseen everywhere that is stylishon the catwalkon magazine coversin major advertising campaigns Nextabovein tough cop thrillers SaracenWhere once a Chanel handbag or bull terrier would have donethe fashionable woman now holds a smiling childThis is said to be getting realbeing very NinetiesA baby says you care read New Ageyou are into the earth misread greenI have heard of some stupid fashion details in my timebut this is the pitsA baby is not some final luxury item that consumers can afford although this is obviously how the Government views itIt does not guarantee you some privileged place on earthNorfor that mattercan family life be a question of chicYet this is how it is being soldSuddenly it is glamorous to appear nice and normaland those who used to want to run the boardroom or run away to Paris now want to stay at home and watch programmes like Roseanne and Kate And Allie new cult programmes that offer a cosy and entirely spurious view of family lifeThe families themselves are presumed to be ordinaryThey are even more trendilymildly disadvantagedthe Cosby family are blackKate and Allie are without husbandsRoseanne is neither rich nor thinTheir lives revolve around the homeunlike in earlier cult shows like Dynasty the officethe hotel lobbyor EastEnders the community squareAnything and everything happens around the kitchen tableand if anything nasty occursit is airedtalked about and solvedIf any among the new reality seekers had a slightly tougher memorythey would recall that there is no such thing as a happy familyThere are some good enough familiessome fairly balanced families and a whole lot of families that resemble one of Mike Leigh's bleaker castsBut a happyordinary family with an answer to every problemYou show me someone who says they come from such a set-up and I will show you a very clever liarThe most voiced reason for having a baby is that the parents can give what was not given in their own livesto compensate for their own emptinessThe child becomes their creationOf course this goes wrongA child is not born for reasons and it will not fit even the prettiest box assigned to it by its determined providersThe child is itselfNot only will it not be like its parentsit probably won't want to beOften the child doesn't even like themNor they itNone of this reality is dealt with in the happy family programmesstill less in the pictures of the beatific model parents and their angelic offspringThese precedents for perfection are not only impossible to achievethey also allow no place for rebellionRebellion of child against adultAnd of adult against childA baby is neither a product nor an invention nor a necessary extension of one's wardrobeIt is another human beingDon't do it

capitalist The socialist councillor was intent on buying up Sheffieldand the YMCAreports Geoffrey Beattieis hoping to make a quick buck for ChristmasHE WAS a socialist all rightYou could tell by his Scottish accent and his tieThis may have been a conservative blue colour with an elegant stripe down the middle of itbut it was all skew-whiffAnd then there were his eyesburning with a fervouran intensityas if he had his prey in his sightsHadn't he already described himself as a political animaland with £19.50p attendance money a day as a Sheffield councilloron which I'm dependent by the wayI'd need to be a political animalAnd here he was with his eyes burning brightTigertigerburning brightThe lines stayed with meAnd as I looked at Jimmy Boyceex-industrial tilerex-foundry workerex-redundant foundry workerI realised that it really was the law of the jungle here tonightThe jungle of the nightMy eyes flitted around the tableHere they all were businesscommercethe big banksThe political animal's eyes were burning againI want the Midland BankNationalise the banksOutrageousBut he didn't want to nationalise themhe just wanted them for himselfThere was a long gapHis neighbour cleared his throatHis neighbour was the sales manager of the Midland Bank in SheffieldHe looked at Jimmy Boyceor rather he looked at his tie all red and bluealmost patrioticand yet the tie still hung at that curious angleIt reminded him of shop stewards with their sleeves rolled up in those endless conferences when it was said that the country was being held to ransomIt reminded him of the big shots in the trade union movement having sandwiches at Number 10 all those years agoNeverhe said as his mind returned to the presentHe cleared his throat againThis time it wasn't so much a reflex actionan attempt to remove something nasty somewhere down his windpipeas a deliberate social signalIt seemed to be sayingYou and who elseor Do you think that you're really big enoughIt acted as both a challenge and a rebuffIt did its jobJimmy paused momentarilyBut I don't want to overstretch myselfThe man from the Midland Bank looked rather pleased with himselfHis throat had stopped ticklingbut then again perhaps it never hadYet this was no place for the faint heartedand Jimmy knew itWhat the hellIt's for the peopleI'll go for itI've been through it allI was made redundant less than a year after I became a Sheffield city councillorand I've never believed in those sorts of coincidencesYou have to fight and fight againNowit wasn't just the man from the Midland Bank who was clearing his throatEveryone in the board room was either clearing his throator shifting position in his seator doing both at the same timewhich is actually rather difficultExcept Jimmy Boycethat isJimmy's audacious move was making everyone feel uncomfortableexcept himselfHe had finally settled to his fatesocialist entrepreneur of the grand scaleIt's early days yetsaid Colin Appleby from the Midlandearly daysHe seemed to be saying it as much to convince himself as to convince all the restThey were still busy with their ticklish coughsBut it was now Colin Appleby's moveFate had got him as far as a leading Sheffield estate agentsBlundellsColin gave that smile of familiaritythat smile of superioritythat certain smile that says it allAhMike's placeYesI am interested in thatI think I will purchase itIt was like a red rag to a bigblack bullOrgiven that we were in a quasi-political domaina black flag to a red bullI want to buy up all of the citysaid JimmyThe statement startled no oneI'll be happy with Mike's place for the momentsaid Colinagain rubbing in that he knew a thing or two about some of Sheffield's leading businessesand that there is no substitute for that kind of detailed and expert and intimate knowledgeBut now it was time for some wheeling and dealingShares in the Sheffield Development Corporation were up for saleRichard Holmesthe sales and marketing officer of the YMCA in Sheffieldhad managed to get his hands on someHe needed to raise capital fastThe man from the Midland Bank said he hadn't the kind of money requiredHe would have liked to help him outbutAll eyes were now on Jimmy BoyceHe had the capitalbut did he have the inclination to buy into yet another business in order to help one of the managers outThe minimum bid was establishedRichard assumed that it would be doubledIt would be a bargain at twice that priceNobody doubted himor failed to recognise his temporary financial embarrassmentIt's just that they were not inclined to help him outIf you can't stand the heatRichardold boyan anonymous voice saidJimmyhoweverdid show some interestI'm always in search of a bargainsonny for the peopleyou understandhe added after yet another of those pauses that suggested it might have been an after-thoughtHe eventually offered Richard £10 more than the asking priceTypical Socialistsomeone mutteredJimmy heard the jibeI'm a Scotafter allNever forget thatsonnyAnd I'm not the one with all the money just look at the pile that Colin Appleby's gotA typical bloody bankerif you ask meNot a bit of wonder the country's in the state that it's inFor readers already familiar with the transmogrification of Sheffield from the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire to something altogether more pragmaticyou could be forgiven for believing that the drama unfolding around the boardroom table was just one more step along this routewith committed socialists playing the stock market with the best of themBut this was just a gameand before some one points out that the stock market is itself just a game for somewhat privileged peopleI should add that this was just a family game being marketed in Sheffield for ChristmasIt's called Sheffield Sharesa form of Monopoly for the late eightiesLocal companies are bought and soldand the involvement and interest that the game generatesas I discoveredis quite intenseRichard Holmes of the Sheffield YMCA told me about the background to the gameThe idea is that Sheffield companies pay real money for the privilege of being squares on the game for the obvious advertising benefitsThe Midland Bankas the major sponsoris paying £20,000 for the privilege of being two corners in the gameand having its name and logo on all the notes used in the gameThe sponsorship money for the 30 squares amounted to £150,000 and paid all the production and advertising costs for the gameAll subsequent profits from sales of the gamewhich retails at £13.99go directly to the YMCA for its work in the community in SheffieldSeveral other British towns and cities are already committed to developing their own version of this gamewith all profits going to the local YMCAKeith Wellsgeneral secretary of the Sheffield YMCAand the fourth player that nightexplained that the idea originated in Norwaywhere 95 towns had produced the game to finance their local YMCAIn the United KingdomDerry/Londonderry was the first and their game was called The Maiden Citypresumably in order not to alienate that half of the community which did not approve of either the name Derry or LondonderryKeith Wells pointed out that the title Sheffield Shares is deliberately ambiguous it can be taken to mean Sheffield's sharesas in shareswhich are up for grabs by keen or greedy speculators my interpretationbut it can also mean Sheffield shares as in shares its wealthand that's basically what we are trying to initiate hereWe're trying to get biglocal companies to plough some of their profits back into the community through the work of the YMCASo what kind of advertising do the companies get for their moneyOn the share cards used in the gamenot only the name of the company is printedbut also some succinct message about the firmSuch messages could at a pushbe used by players to help them promote the value of the shares in that company in the interminable rounds of wheeling and dealingAs in How would you like to buy some shares in Stocksbridge Engineering Works Manufacturers of high integrity alloystainless and re-melted steels for the aerospaceenergybearing and automotive industriesThe Strength Behind Engineering ProgressOr the more punchy How would you like to buy some shares in Gibbs Building Contractors Don't pick your contractor/ By throwing a dice/ Bring GIBBS into the game/ Ask us for a priceEven if it is not read out in the endless rounds of buying and selling sharesthen the messagepassive though it might beshould still find its way into the living rooms of a high proportion of homes in the Sheffield regionThe plan is to sell 20,000 games in Sheffield over the Christmas period that is1 in 20 homesThere are 4,000 advance ordersA lot of familiesit is hopedare going to be hearing or reading about Stocksbridge Engineering WorksGibbs Building Contractorsand a few other Sheffield firms this ChristmasColin Applebyof the Midland Bankis extremely pleased with the way the game has turned outHe says that as well as being the major sponsor of the gamethe Midland is the largest private sector employer in Sheffieldand the game provided another opportunity for the bank to demonstrate that it is prepared to invest in the cityBut what sort of person will make a good player at Sheffield SharesI'd already noted the very different methods of the four who had assembledIt would have taken a blind manor a very naive onenot to spot some connection between their style of play and the kinds of responsibilities and decisions they have to make in the outside worldI asked Colin Appleby firstI liked Jimmy Boyce's play for his quick decisionsRichard Holmes was something of an expert at the gamebut he ended up as a down-and-out by the endI think the main ingredient for success is that you have to have a good sense of timingThere is nothing wrong with being a bit conservative and building up financial resourcesand not just jumping straight inJimmy had a lot of flair but it didn't help him winIndeed it did notColin's conservativism and steady timing had won him second placeRichard Holmes thought that the best man usually winsdespite the fact that he was lastJimmy Boyce put it down nearly all to luck with negotiation skills being very importantJimmy said he really enjoyed playingbut his slight worry about it was that at £13.99 it might prove expensive for the unemployedBut what did the winner of the game actually think Keith Wellsthe man who had brought the game to England but had never actually played it beforeThere was a long pausethe kind of pause that winners always display as they create a little time to savour their victoryIt's basically a fine balance between being a good steward of what you have already acquiredand being something of a visionaryRather like running the YMCA in factalthough I'd never thought of it like that beforeIt was all jolly good fun as wellof course © Geoffrey Beattie Richard Holmessales and marketing officer at the YMCAwatches the Sheffield

Borough Council v Bujok Before Lord Justice Watkins and Mr Justice Hutchison November 2 1989IF a dwelling house is in such a state of disrepair as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisancethe tenant may lay an information against his landlord alleging the existence of a statutory nuisance under the Public Health Act 1936The tenant is not obliged to ensure that the landlord is aware of the defects in the premises or to give the landlord an opportunity to remedy the defects before commencing legal proceedingsAlthough that is the position in lawthe court emphasised that as a matter of commonsense a tenant should first complain to the landlord before exercising the right to prosecuteThe factsMrs Bujok and her family occupied a house as council tenantsIn September 1988 Mrs Bujok laid an information against the council alleging the existence and continuance of a statutory nuisance under section 92(1) of the Public Health Act 1936It was alleged that the councilbeing the owners of the premiseswere the persons by whose actdefault or sufferance the nuisance arosePrior to laying the information Mrs Bujok had not served an abatement notice upon the council or informed them of the alleged defects in the premisesThe justices held Mrs Bujok was not required to ensure that the council were aware of the defective state of the property prior to laying the informationThe council appealed by case statedThe legislationSection 92(1) of the 1936 Act defines statutory nuisancesas any premises in such a state as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisanceThe decisionMr Justice Hutchison said the 1936 Act primarily envisages a system where the local authority has a power and a duty to try to secure that premises are not in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisanceAction is initiated by the service of an abatement notice requiring remedial workIf the person in default fails to comply with an abatement notice the local authority is obliged to make a complaint to the magistratesIf the complaint is proveda nuisance order is made requiring the defendant to get the necessary work doneEffectively the sequence is that the person in default is told what is wrong and is required to put it rightHe is given an opportunity to do soand if he does nothe is subject to sanctions by the court to compel him to do soThe problem arises in connection with section 99 which adapts or applies the provisions to cases where an individual rather than the local authority wishes to make the complaintNeed he serve an abatement noticeThe authorities plainly establish that he need not and cannot do soDoes that mean he may lay an information and bring the matter before the magistrates without first putting the person alleged to be in default on notice of what is allegedThe council argued that a landlordparticularly one such as a local authoritycannot realistically be expected to have a system of inspection of all its premises and in practice is entitled to depend upon notification by its tenantsFor Mrs Bujok it was argued that the 1936 Act was designed to secure in the interests of the community at large that statutory nuisances did not existIt was submitted that an owner cannot turn his back on his property because when he purchases and takes on the responsibility of lettinghe knows the property will in the course of time deteriorateHe must therefore satisfy himself on a regular basis that it does not constitute a statutory nuisanceIn Warner v Lambeth London Borough Council 198515 HLR 4550Lord Justice Glidewell said a private person could lay an information alleging the failure to abate a statutory nuisance without first giving notice requiring abatementTherefore in the present case the justices came to the correct conclusionHis Lordship reached that decision without enthusiasm because it seemed that as a matter of common sensenotice should be given in such circumstances before criminal proceedings were launchedLord Justice Watkins said he agreed with reluctanceIt was surely repugnant to commonsense that in this area of legal activity a local authority should be prosecuted by one of its tenants without first being given the opportunity by that tenant to remedy the consequences of a neglect to repair the dwelling that the tenant occupiedIn law there was no doubt that Mrs Bujok was entitled to commence proceedings without giving notice of the state of the dwelling to the councilBut in every other conceivable way that action was entirely wrongEndless trouble to many people in courts and council offices and much money could be saved by the giving of notice of disrepairIf the council did not react to that noticethen would be the time for the tenant to exercise the right to prosecuteParliament should give fresh thought to enacting a provision placing an obligation upon a council tenant to give notice to the council before being permitted to commence proceedingsAppearancesJohn Cherryman QC instructed by

themPERHAPS there should be more hypocrisy in the worldThere's plenty in BritainThe British go to night classes in itand particularly savour high-class hypocritesThey tend to admire people for how they hold themselves and what they say and then blame them more for being found out than for what they doAfter a while you get tainted with hypocrisy even if you try not toYou begin to see that it's just another languageYou begin to enjoy the way people can say The National Health Service is safe in our handsor Nobody deplores apartheid more than we door even We do not have a shoot-to-kill policyand you know that another hospital is going to close and that there will be another stitch-up with Pretoria and that another shooting is going to be quietly forgottenIt isadmittedlyrefreshing to meet the occasional non-slippery politicianFranklyTimwe cocked that one upan Antipodean politico said to me onceWe made a real dog's breakfast of itIt was quite a clever move on his partSuddenly I didn't have anything else to ask himActuallypoliticians are never that frankand never honestthe game isn't played that wayAnd anywayif somebody is too forthright and says what he really thinks you might feel impelled to hit him with a brickBut then hypocrisy has gradeslike judoIn Britain they are all black beltsThe British murmur You must come and stay with us some timeand when they part they say Let's keep in touchand they certainly don't mean itbut it greases the wheels of intercourseAnd it stops you having to hit them with a brickThere have been grade-A hypocrites all through historyThe Roman Emperors were much more slippery than anyone gives them credit forOne of them once issued an edict against promiscuous kissing on New Year's DayHe complained about the absurd cost of mullet and in a wild bid to introduce good housekeeping to Imperial Rome he served for dinner what was leftover from the banquet beforeHe showed excessivecourtesy to the House of the Senatesaying once You willI hopeforgive me if I trespass on my rights as a senator by speaking rather more plainly than I shouldIt was the Emperor Tiberiusone of history's unspeakable boundersSince this is a family newspaperone shrinks from recounting the things he bounded round doing on CapriBut they had nothing to do with cheap mulletTiberius was one of those men you are warned to flee from and report to the police when they arrive offering sweetsHe was one of those men of whom the historian Edward Gibbonwho wrote the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empirereported their disgusting activities in the decent obscurity of a learned languageThat meant he could say it in Latinwhichwhen you think about itwas another fundamental hypocrisyBut fundamentalists are not usually hypocritesThey are a different problemThey believe in the truth and they aren't frightened of telling you about itTheir truth of coursebut they recognise no otherFurthermore they don't know about good formand bad formand saying one thing and doing anotherBut fundamentalists are also really dangerousat least for a whilebecause hypocrites think that everybody is talking double talklike themand awful misunderstandings occurThey don't have to be religious fundamentalistsThey can just be people who believe they ought to reshape society from top to bottomBut they are just as difficult to read if you are used to political hypocrisyBut then the British or perhaps more properly the English deal best with their ownTo themhypocrisy is aggravated assault by other meansThey can execrate someone whom they decide is a useless clown and they do this by making him a Lordgiving him the chairmanship of a quango and telling the chaps at the Athenaeum to hand him non-executive directorships in 15 companies and a merchant bankIt's the same as knee-cappingand everybody knows itbut much kinderFundamentalists execrate someone for writing a book that they haven't readand a famous novelist has to go into hiding for fear of his lifeWellat least he knewright there and thenthat he had to go into hidingThere is one thing in favour of total non-hypocrisyat least you know where you standfor as long as you are allowed to standandof courseas long

beautiful piece of countryside where he livesOUR family lives in a cottage in Scarisbrick pronounced Scazebrickthat is more than 100 years oldAll the windows look out on fieldsIt is a magic placeand safeThere are skylarks and foxes and an owl sits in the apple tree staring at us by the fire in winterScarisbrick is the largest parish in Lancashire with more than 8,000 acres of Grade 1 agricultural land and flatwith copses and woodsThe soil is richfertile and dark brownWe were very upset when we found out that a dual carriageway might be built in the fields past the wild duck pond behind our homeMy sister Lucy is 18We've lived here since she was a babyThere is also Laura17me15and William is 12William and I decided to write to Prince Charles because we know he loves the countrysideMrs Thatcher cares about the environment so we sent her a letter tooA reply came thanking us for our letter and saying it is receiving attentionWe think a bypass would rip the heart out of Scarisbrickthe village where we live and some farmers would be ruinedPeople all over the country eat vegetables grown in ScarisbrickThe air smells lovelyof leeks and straw and the breeze from the sea five miles awayOur MP Mr Ken Hind ConservativeWest Lancswrote to people in Scarisbrick saying that he has pushed the Department of Transport into accepting the need for a bypass between Ormskirk and SouthportNow it is in the government's white paperHundreds of residents had a public meeting in the village hall to hear Ken Hind explain about the bypassIt will cost £10 million and could be 13 years before it's builtBut it's in the white paper for road building throughout the countryWe know the main A570 is a busy road and accidents happen and people who live there think a bypass is a good ideaIt must be horrible for them when cars crash outside their homesBut not everyone here thinks the answer is to dig up the fields and destroy the character of the communityBut the farmer down the lane is worried because he wanted his little ladwho is sixto be the fifth generation of the family to farm the moss landHe says it is some of the best land in the countryif not the worldWilliam helps the farmer next to us and he is disappointed because he grows really good wheat and spuds and cabbagesHe was saving the farm for his grandchildrenOur dad loves walking over the fields when he comes home tired from working in the cityIt helps him relaxWe go with himand our sisters tooand sometimes a hare jumps out in front of us or a pheasant flies up from the ditchWe love it here because it is unspoiled and old fashionedAn old man called Mr Leatherbarrow used to grow prize-winning onions on the mossHe had a patch of land he ploughed with a hand plough and he told us stories about coming home across the fields in snowdrifts with carthorsesHe had to carry a clothes prop to feel where the ditches whereOnce a horse drowned on the mossWe bought our cottage from himThere's a well in the gardenIf a dual carriageway is built the fields will be just concrete and we'll lie awake listening to cars zooming past and seeing flashing lightsWe'd like the people who want to build the bypass to visit the mossIf

provision is better than mostyet the Director of Social ServicesJohn Rea Pricefeels Islington has been penalised for attempting to carry out the Government's own directives on community careRate capping has meant that for every profligatepound spent on such provision£6 has been taken awayIslington cannot even benefit from the dowrysystem money paid by a health authority to a local authority for each patient returning to the community from hospitalbecause their people never went to hospitalMany local authorities have had their budgets cut by reductions in central government They've been given better education and higher expectationsbut no futuregrants and now have a far greater shortfall of places than IslingtonA white paper is expected at the end of this month in response to the Griffiths Reportwhich recommended that authorities be given greater responsibility for the mentally handicappedUnless Griffiths funding comes quickly to the rescuesays Rea Pricethere is no hope of extra resourcesA recent and the firstreport by the Social Services Inspectorate on day services for the mentally handicapped finds much to criticiseIt admits that funds are needed for training and basic equipmentand finds that the principles of community care have often not been fully understoodFew middle management have direct experience of the serviceneed has not been quantified nor fed through to plannersvery few local authorities have involved parentslet alone clientsStaff feel undervalued and lack any sense of directionjoint philosophies between health and local authorities are rarethere are no long-term strategies to solve the problems and many centres are overcrowdedoffering only sharedpart-time placesCentres for the physically handicapped have traditionally taken the elderlyand youngsters finding themselves there after leaving school may feel their adult lives have ended rather than just begunMencap's Day Services campaign indicates that the most desperate need is for the severely handicapped and those with behavioural difficultiesFor those with more moderate disabilities there are YTS schemesbut these are generalisednot geared to individual needsThe handicapped may be a minority group but it's a vast one the last count10 years agototalled six million people with identified disabilitiesA hidden and forgotten problem rather than a small oneWe're fighting a losing battlesays Richard Tomlinsonheadmaster of the Thomas Delarue School for young people with cerebral palsyIt's not a cohesive group and has no political edgeTo get money you've got to present an image of disability that reinforces rather than changes the stereotype flaxen-haired moppets in callipersIf you actually show people in much greater needyoung adultsthey're not so attractiveThey might dribbleWe're articulate enough to fool ourselves that we're nice peoplebut there's a strong undercurrent to our thinking that encourages us to view people with a disability as lesserand until we come to terms with thatwe will never have a proper support systemAt present the whole thing is on guilt moneyI'm glad it's not my kidsHere's a fiverThe present situation reinforces his ideasNo social services or Government department will deny that everyone is of equal valuesays Mencapbut the services don't support thatEven if people are unattractiveaggressivedistortedvomit and

healthier life and higher expectationsbut no futureLACK of communication is one of the saddest aspects of having a mentally handicapped childAs a social workerI met family after family and the isolation that having a specialchild brings was a common themeThe burden inevitably fell mainly on the mothers and it seemed that their loneliness could at least be lessened if they had a regular opportunity to share their experiencesThe group began with mothers responding to my invitation and deciding tentatively whether there was anything in itfor themSeveral women felt too vulnerable or exposed to remainanother left dramaticallyannouncing that her anger would destroy the groupThe beginning was also a time when I was asked if Itoowould soon let them down like all the othersand when being there was expressed for all by JanetI'm only here because my daughter is the way she isI'd rather not be hereOr by Shirleywho cried soundlessly and then protestedI'm not crying for myselfI'm crying for the othersGradually trust developed and themes emergedsadnessA grief with no endangerWhy did it happen to meand frustration with the professionals who could not fully understand their plightThe subjective experiences of these mothers became the mainthemefor examplehow rejected they felt by friends or neighbours who crossed the streetnot knowing what to sayThey talked of their husbands' preoccupation with workof their normal children's too-early maturingof integrated and special schoolsand of eating the hoped-for miracle diet for their child oroftenthe consolation they found in foodThese mothers had built a cocoon around themselves and their handicapped child whichwhile keeping away the hurtful commentswrapped them in with their painThenone weekthe quietest woman in the group saidThis is the only place where I can afford to be honestand somehow it seemed the healing process had begunLeora personified the courageI remember her trying to calm her screaming autistic

for coffeeher friend held the handicapped child and Jean made believe she wasn't mineThe sadness came out week by week and we confronted itIncrediblythere was laughtertooand companionshipWe gained energy from each other and I determined that this strength must be used creativelyTheir frustration that they would always remain only a mummy could be challengedWe considered how much weourselveshold on to an eternally-caring-for-others roleStirrings of feminist vitalityI wanted to help these women to find a voiceand no longer to place their needs at the bottom of the list of prioritiesGradually we re-evaluated ourselves as women and looked at the way we had always put ourselves downOne member had described the work she does as just a little jobThe rabbi's wife had insisted it was her role to attend to their epileptic daughter several times each nighther husband must sleep to be strong for the communityBut there was change in the airone woman began to study and others took their cue from herI encouraged them to writeTogether we compiled an article for publicationIt was rawfrank and eventually it appeared in printBy now the time had come for me to hand back to these women

his most senior colleagues invite them to Scotland Yardor visit them at the ALA building nearbyAccording to Walter Easeythe ALA police policy advisorunder Sir Kenneth Newmanthis would have been quite impossibleWe don't make a big public fuss but he answers our questionsand we answer hisWe try to keep it low temperatureIt's a very good regular basis for discussing thingsThe meetings are only the most visible signs of a thaw in the relationship previously something close to undeclared war between the Yard and the Labour authorities since Sir Peter's accession in 1987It affects relations at all levelsSir Kennethfor exampleset up multi-agency panels to deal with the cautioning of juvenilesdesigned to keep as many as possible out of the courtsBut in many boroughsMr Easey saidwe began to find that whatever we saidthey'd go ahead and charge them anywaySeveral boroughs withdrew as a resultThe police attitude nowmany councils have foundis more receptiveand the panels have been reconstitutedAuthorities have begun to find that multi-agency cooperation in other fields notably racial violence need not be a mask for police interferenceThe recent attempt by Clive Pearmanthe chief superintendent in charge of Notting Hillto persuade the two local councils to cut off funds to voluntary orgnanisations which he considered inimical was an example of an approach whose shortcomings have come to be appreciated at the YardThe ALA has had a major influence in redesigning the police recruitment formswhich have gone through three drafts since the Met tried to interest Labour councils in their campaign to attract more ethnic minority officersThe concept of indirect discrimination wasaccording to the councilsat first unfamiliar to policewho also saw no reason why black candidates might be put off by the former question three which asked the country of origin of spouse or lover's parentsThese difficulties having been resolvedseveral former so-called loony-leftcouncils have mounted police recruitment exhibitions and meetingsIn partthe emerging entente must be attributed to the authorities' move to the righttowards the Kinnockite orthodoxy favoured by Margaret Hodgethe Islington and ALA leaderBut the Met has shown itself increasingly willing to respond to overturesfor example instituting procedures to check criminal records of applicant child-care workers and foster parents for sex offencesCamden and Islington councilsmeanwhilehave given the Met a free copy of LAFIS a computer programme which they developed at a cost of £15 millionand sold to other authorities for about £2 million a throwIt is now being adapted to give the Met its first method for running cost accounting in 150 yearsFive of the 13 Labour authorities still refuse to participate in local consultative groupsalthough Brent is about to reverse its policy and in Ealing the matter is under discussionBut as the Labour parliamentary front bench scents the thawand surveys the possibility of government for the first time in a decadethe party pressures running in favour of detente are increasingOVERNIGHT FILE PAGE socAn astonishing shift of power A crucial speech by Sir Peter Imbert underlines the extent of the differences between him and his predecessorsTHE EXTENT of the philosophical shift taking place at the top of the Metropolitan Police was illustrated in a speech delivered by Sir Peter Imbert to the International Police Exhibition and Conference in London at the end of SeptemberThe brief reports which have appeared of this remarkable address dealt with Sir Peter's appeal for glasnost within the forceOpenness must be central to the policing of a democratic and pluralist societyhe saidall too oftenthe police had retreated behind one of many walls of silencegiving one of a series of stock excuses to the press and public for refusing to disclose informationBut the depth of the speech's radicalism has not reached a wider publicSir Peter justified his call for openness in terms which would have been unthinkable from his immediate predecessorSir Kenneth Newmanand indeed from any predecessorProfessionsincluding policetend by definition to be monopolists of knowledge and through that knowledgepowerYet to set ourselves up in such a manner contradicts our cherished notion of being part of the communityKey parts of the speech signalled a consciousalmost revolutionary departure from some of Sir Kenneth's most cherished notionsIts full title was Preparing Police to Deal with a Multicultured Societyand it was on the subject of policing black communities still the most vexatious and controversial for both police and their critics that Sir Peter made his thoughts most plainThe doctrines and policy of Sir Kenneth Newman were set out candidly in an unpublishedprivate lecture to the European Atlantic Group in 1983entitled Public Order in Free SocietiesThe text has achieved great influencedisseminated widely among senior officersand taught formally at the Bramshill Police CollegeIts terms and implications are unmistakably authoritarianAll democratic societiesSir Kenneth saidmust strike a balance between order and freedomand in multi-ethnic societiesthis posed an acute dilemmaIn Britainas in Germanythe first generation of immigrants had been relatively law-abidingbut discussion on ethnic minorities now centred on crime and crime controlAs Lord Scarmanreporting after the 1981 riotshad pointed outthe underlying crisis was social and economicBut this was outside the police remitand meanwhilethey had to be careful not to jeopardise public tranquillityA permanent state of war with the community was untenablebut the law must be enforcedIn multi-ethnic areaswith their symbolic locationslike All Saints Road and Broadwater Farmused for the sale of drugs and stolen goodspolice could not act aloneSir Kenneth saidIt is not sufficient to think only in terms of crime controlWe need to lift the problem to a higher level of generalityencompassed by the expression social controlin a benign sensein order to provide a unifying concept within which the activities of police and other agencies can be co-ordinatedSir Kenneth's agent in this project was multi-agencycooperationa buzzword throughout the 1980s in police and Home Office circlesBut in his visionthe police would be giving the leadlaying down a clear social policyIt was crucial that the police maintain operational independenceParty political interferencehe saidrejecting the possibility of a London police authoritywas especially to be abhorredHe was tryinghe saidto avoid a shift in the balance between freedom and orderBut neverthelessWe should not forget that an over-regard for individual liberties can put at risk that sense of order and security without which no community can be truly freeSir Kenneth concluded with a sideswipe at his criticsIt was in these very multi-ethnic areas with their myriad problems that political agitators exploit civil liberties issuesand play down the issue of communal securityindividual liberties are importantbut we must not become so obsessed with them that we overlook the importance of communal freedomLike Sir KennethSir Peter Imbert recalled the riots of 1981 and 1985and the conflict between police and ethnic minoritiesBut the intellectual foundation of his proposed solution was diametrically opposed to that of his predecessorThere were some basic principlesto be adopted in police/community relationsSir Peter saidBut in seeking to broaden this perspectivethere were a number of propositions which police officers need to understandFirsthe saidthe community itself should be the primary focusnot the policeThe community was not homogenousbut made up of a multitude of different groups with different attitudes and beliefswhile relations within the communitybetween different groupsare significantly outside the control of the policeSir Peter then tackled the Newman concept of an interventionistsocial controlling police force directlyMembers of the community are themselves in the course of events engaged in a great deal of informal social controlhe saidIt is the community who shouldin the maindetermine whether police are to be involved in resolving community conflictsAs policehe went onwe sometimes quite wrongly assume the monopoly of good ideas on good community relations and good policingthe public have a right to be actively involved in determining how policing is developedSir Kenneth Newman's retreat behind operational independencewas cast outThe major precepts of his philosophy Sir Peter declared to beOpennessaccesspower sharing and the sharing of responsibilitySuch preceptsaccording to one senior officerwere in the context of the previous 150 years of the Metropolitan Policesimply astonishingAgaindeveloping the idea of power sharingSir Peter implicitly criticised his predecessor and his vision of the multi-agency approachIf openness and access are problematicpower sharing is likely to be even more problematicEarly efforts to become involved in multi-agency approaches to crime and associated topics were painful experienceswe wanted to maintain the lead in every forumto be the gatekeepers of power and have the right of veto if decisons were made which did not suit usThose attitudesSir Peter saidstill lingeredPower sharing was not an easy path to treadBut it does not mean a surrender of powerrather it involves sharing of the knowledge which allows different interpretations and constructions to be placed on that information and which in turn can lead to a different conclusion and different solutionsPolice must find out from our consumers what it is they require from ushow sensitive we are being to their needs and how satisfied they are with the servicePolls of Asiansfor examplehad shown that they felt particularly vulnerable and dissatisfiedit was essential to have the will to acton this information when allocating scarce resourcesThe policehe concludedmust possess an unswerving commitment to communication and consultation within which police and the community are equal partnersWell-founded criticism could only be met with a willingness to changeOVERNIGHT FILE PAGE socAn opening at the Met Despite resistance by its more conservative elementsthe Metropolitan Police has begun a process of reform that should lead to improvements in the way it operates and encourage better relations with the publicTHROUGH the corridors of Scotland Yarda wind of change is blowingThe small faction of senior officers who believe that the police must undertake radical reform in order to remain viable has gained an increasingly confidentially in the shape of the Metropolitan CommissionerSir Peter ImbertImplicitlythey have accepted many of the criticisms made for more than a decade by Labour councils and civil libertariansthat a force which has dug itself in behind ramparts of elitist isolationism must begin to respond to demands of the public it serves and their political representativesSir Peter speaks frequently of power sharinga notion which goes well beyond mere participation in the local consultative groups established by the Police and Criminal Evidence ActIt is no coincidence that since Sir Peter became Commissioner in 1987the relationship between Scotland Yard and London's 13 Labour authorities has seen a new detenteWith the new Home SecretaryDavid Waddingtondisplaying a marked lack of enthusiasm for Sir Peter's other pet projectthe creation of a national detection agencysenior officers are beginning to consider the prospect of a Labour Home Office with equanimityThey find themselvesfor the first timeable to contemplate the two main features of Labour policygreater independence in the investigation of complaints and a London police authoritywith something less than total horrorThe signs of reform were stirring before the advent of Sir PeterThe anonymous authors of the 1986 annual Met internal appraisalfor examplewrote in deeply critical terms of the effects of government economic policy on the inner cityand the consequences for policingBut the seminal event was Sir Peter's decison to publish A Force for Changethe survey carried out last year by the Wolff Olins consultancyThe report said that the Met was scruffyrudeand operating from shabby police stationsThese important barriers in the fostering of a good realtionship with the public were bad enoughbut the force was also undertrainedriven with internal struggleand isolated from society in a state of siegeMost policemen felt beleaguered and misunderstoodtheir isolation further deepened by criticism from politicians and the mediaReforming and reactionary police officers are not unaware that public confidence in the police has meanwhile ebbed awayCauses celebres like the Guildford Four are bad enoughFranklywe all know the criminal justice system is in tattersone superintendent said last weekBut as demonstrated by a variety of research including both internal police studies and external work like the 1985 Islington Crime Survey more damaging still is the accumulation of the public's direct and disappointing contacts with policeThe publication of A Force for Change was crucial because it represented an important internal victory for the reformersand established glasnost as the principle by which the Met was to be put rightThe conservatives at the Yardwho include the considerable figure of the Deputy CommissionerJohn Dellowbelieve that the Met has been reorganised quite enough recently and has been unsettled by a succession of commissionersall with strong and mutually conflicting ideasIn their opinionthe calling in of Wolff Olins was more of a symptom of this malaise than any kind of cureThe Wolff Olins authors commented that the publication of their work represented a profound cultural changeThisthey saidshould accompany the profound managerial changewhich must be next on the agendasomehow to tackle Londoners' personal and local dissatisfaction with the policeTHE main public response to A Force for Change is the Plus Programmea continuing series of measures drawn up by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Charles Pollard and Commander Alec MarnochReports of the programme have concentrated on its cosmetic aspectsBut its greater underlying significance is demonstrated by the fact that ittoohas been strongly opposed by Yard conservativesAccording to members of the reforming factionsome officers have attempted to use Sir Peter Imbert's apparent discomfiture over his role in the Guildford Four case to discredit the Plus Programmewith which he is closely identifiedAt the heart of the strategy is a change of balance in the police's own perception of their roleFor 150 yearspolice have regarded their job as the control of crime and criminalsof coping with social deviancyUnder the programmewhat internal documents describe as the public service traditionof the Met is to be emphasised as never beforeAggressive behaviour is to be not only discouraged but monitored and disciplinedthe public regarded as consumerscustomers and paymasters of policingnot potential villains or troublemakersAccompanying the programme is To Serve and Protect10 commandments for everyday policing issued to every officerafter consultation over its text with MPs and community organisationsThe first value of every member of the organisationis to uphold the law fairly and firmlyBut some of the others are less familiarStressing the need to behave in a manner which is neither racist nor sexistto uphold individual rightsand to cooperate and consult with the community and other agencies in pursuing our purposehas not gone down well with conservative officersIt would be possible to dismiss the Plus Programme as merely an expression of a different stylewithout substance or commitment to institutional changeEvidence that it is not is provided by a confidentialinternal report on CID work circulated to senior officers earlier this yearthe Crime Investigation Priority Project CIPPIts authorssignificantlywere not an outside firm but police officersIdentifying many of the same failings as Wolff OlinsCIPP's first core recommendation was that crime investigation should be made victim-focussedand that CID departments give higher priority to the victims of crime and witnessesThe needs of victimsit continuedcan be clearly statedare feasible and are not being metAn orientation towards customersneeds and rights is becoming a prevailing ethos in society which the police cannot ignoreButCIPP saida number of officers we interviewed do not understand these needsThe report went onVictim satisfaction is not directly linked to the outcome of individual investigationsIt is much more closely concerned with how closely the police adhere to the kind of standards the public expects from any large organisationincluding promptnessa sympathetic attitude which indicates individual attentionsome conspicuous activity and clear information about what will happen nextIt was CIPP which first recommended the abolition announced earlier this week of the controversial system of crime screeningby which many offences were not investigated because of a lack of evidenceIt was discouraging officers from investigating crimes fullyeven those which could be cleared upThe report made a series of recommendations on increasing CID strengthwhich has fallen sharply from 10 per cent of the force in 1973 to 7.4 per centdespite an overall large increase in numbers and a recommendation by Her Majesty's Inspectorate that provincial CIDs should make up 12.4 per cent of policeThese are now being implementedBut the most significant part of CIPP dealt with institutional changethe perestroika to follow Sir Peter Imbert's glasnost whichif implementedwould represent exactly the profound managerial changerecommended by Wolff OlinsThe height and extent of the inbuilt hurdles in the way of reforming a police force are not commonly appreciatedThe incoming chairman of a public company can swiftly dispose of dead woodto arrange a board in sympathy with new policiesBut police officers can be dismissed only if severe disciplinary charges are proven against themIt is possible to arrange retirements on spurious medicalgroundsbut this practice was heavily criticised by the Commons Home Affairs select committee earlier this yearThe ensuing problems for a reforming commissioner begin at the topwith the Scotland Yard policy committee the deputyassistant and deputy assistant commissionersby whom all major changes haveeffectivelyto be ratifiedThe reformerlike a US president with a recalcitrant supreme courtcan secure a majority in his favour only as they retiredie or move on to better thingsBROUGHT about by lifetime tenure The lack of accountability is analagous at divisional levelConservative CIDsfor examplehave all sorts of tricks to frustrate an incoming radical chief superintendentby which they can legally send clear-up rates into a tailspin so leading to the rapid transfer of the reforming senior officerIncrediblyit is almost impossible even to return a detective to uniform simply on the grounds that he isn't very goodCIPP grasped this nettleSupervision of subordinates is focussed on bureaucratic procedures and not on the quality of service at the point of delivery to the publicAll supervising officersincluding senior divisional managers chief superintendents should not only hold themselves accountablebut be actively held accountable for the overall level of their subordinatesTo achieve these goalssenior police officers needed a weaponwhat the CIPP report delicately called deselectionThis mightit saidmean the removal of CID officers to uniformHowevermany officers interviewed were in favour of administrative dismissalnot currently available under police regulationsAn overwhelming majority of those who still baulked at actual sacking favoured return to uniformwith the view that CID officers who are lazy and incompetent were so primarily because of the absence of the eventual sanction of removal from specialist dutySir Peter Imbert and the Yard reformers have important allies in the regional forcesGeoffrey Dearthe West Midlands chief constablewhose boldness at disbanding his serious crimes squad cannot be discountedwhatever his eventual career ambitionsand Paul Condonthe new Kent chiefformerly in charge of Met training and personnelBut circumstancesand the perceived depth of public alienationare
