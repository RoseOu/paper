STEWART-MOORE farm at Ballycastle won the coveted All-Ireland Farming and Conservation award earlier this yearSo 200 people came to an eventorganised by the Farming Wildlife and Advisory Group FWAG to see for themselves what made it so specialAnd as they walked around the 230 acre farmall of it in the extended Less Favoured Areasthey were able to see at first hand why Hume Stewart-Moore and his son Michael were so successfulOn the farm many conservation measures have been undertakenincluding extensive tree plantingsrestoration of traditional stone walls and the creation of two pondsone for ducks and the other as a rich habitat for a range of aquatic flora and faunaThe Stewart-Moore farm is now widely recognised as one of the best examples in Ireland of commercial farming complementing

babyresearchers warned todaySchizophreniaor split personalityis the most common serious mental illness and studies carried out so far hint at a genetic linkalthough no susceptible genes have yet been identifiedProfessor Robin Murrayof the Institute of Psychiatry and King's College HospitalLondontold the annual British Association Science Festivalat Keele UniversityStaffordshirethe flu risk to unborn babies seemed to affect girls rather that boys following four studies he had carried out in EnglandAbnormalAnd investigation of brain cells showed abnormalities in sufferersHe told the conference pre-natal viral illness may explain the higher rates of schizophreniafound in city-born people and in Afro-Caribbean immigrants in EnglandProfessor Murray believes the root of the problem lies in a fault with the child's immune cells in the brainIf a schizophreniagene is involved in the immune response to viral infectionsit could explain the persistence of such a seemingly disadvantageous gene in the populationhe saidThirty years ago Julian Huxley and Eliot Slater speculated that the reason why the disadvantageous schizophrenia gene was not progressively eliminated from the gene pool was that it conveyed some biological advantage such as resistance to infectionMy study reviews the evidence that a genetically-determined maternal response to influenza results in

seven trophies in the processReaders of Practical Caravanmagazine not only voted the Cavalier Turbo 2.0i 4x4 their Top Towing Carbut also Best Large Family CarThe Cavalier's victory follows similar overall wins by the Senator CD 3.0i and Cavalier 2.0i 4x4 in 1992 and 1991THEY used to be considered dirtyslownoisy and uncomfortableBut these days new technology has transformed oil-burning cars into one of the most civilised forms of personal transportAnd the result is that more motorists than ever are opting for life behind the wheel of a diesel vehicleThat trend is demonstrated in a sales bonanza which saw 142,000 people in the UK opting for a diesel car in the first half of this yearThat figure is remarkable when compared to just 87,000 during the first six months of last yearAnd the dramatic rise in popularity of some makes is sensational such as Nissanwhose sales increase is more than 3,000 per centEven the already-established big sellerslike Renaulthave sold 200 per cent more diesel models so far this yearBut even these figuresimpressive as they areare likely to be merely the tip of the iceberg in comparison to the huge gains yet to be madeAll of a suddendiesel motoring has moved into overdrivebringing us into line with most of our EC counterpartsThe cars themselves are shaking off their old imagetooIn many cases they are now actually quicker than their petrol-engined equivalentsdespite offering considerable gains in economyThe advantages of dieselsin addition to better fuel consumptionare reliability because there are no ignition components to go wronglongevity because the engines are very low-revvingand excellent trade-in values because they are highly desirable on the secondhand marketSeveral companiessuch as Citroenhave started to offer diesel models for the same price as petrol-powered onesFor examplethe new Citroen Xantia diesel costs exactly the same as the 1.6-litre petrol versionThe fact that even companies with strong sporting imagessuch as BMWhave now decided to enter the UK's fledgling diesel market is another indication that it is only a matter of time before there is a diesel option of every car currently on sale in petrol guiseIn addition to better economydiesel cars use cheaper fuel and are no less environmentally-friendly than petrol-engined models fitted with catalytic convertersNowadays as many as one in five cars on UK roads is a dieselThat seems a far cry from just a few years ago when the only diesels were lorriesbuses and the occasional taxiSoto meet the demands of the diesel boomoil companies have installed diesel pumps alongside those for petrolThey have also developed additives which prevent the fuel from frothing so that it no longer spills over your shoes every time you fill-upAnd they have agreed a uniform black colour scheme for all garages to prevent mix-ups with petrolwhich used to be common in the early days of the diesel revolutionThe best-selling small diesel model is currently the Ford Fiestafollowed by the Peugeots 205 and 106and the Renault ClioThe most popular small family models are the Vauxhall AstraCitroen ZX and Ford EscortIn the upper-medium sector the big sellers are the Peugeot 405Vauxhall Cavalier and during the first half of this year the Citroen BXA rapidly-increasing number of executive models are diesels toowith the Mercedes 200 and 190and Vauxhall Carlton being the favouritesLatest tests indicate that Citroen's new Xantia diesel model is actually quieter than a petrol-engined Ford MondeoAnother common feature of all new diesels is instant startingFormerly there were glow-plugs which had to be warmed before the engine would fireThe performance of diesels has been transformed by the availability of turbochargers on most modelsgiving the majority of them cruising capabilities in excess of 100mphSome now come with the option of automatic transmissionand a small number are even available with air conditioning previously
