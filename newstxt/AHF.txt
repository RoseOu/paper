Tories focus on credibility of KinnockBy GEORGE JONESPOLITICAL EDITORTHE Conservatives sought last night to force the election debate back on to Mr Kinnock's fitness to govern and the economywith a warning that Labour would plunge Britain from recession into a full-blown slumpAs Labour confidently outlined the contents of its first Queen's Speechincluding a commitment to introduce by summer a Bill to establish a Scottish Parliamentthe three main parties prepared for a big push over the last weekend of the campaignFive national opinion polls in tomorrow's newspapers are keenly awaited after a survey in London showed Labour's lead slipping a couple of pointsThe two main parties are still neck and neckpointing to a hung ParliamentWith Labour and the Liberal Democrats still arguing over the terms of a possible deal based on proportional representationthe Tories intensified their attack on Mr Kinnock's suitability for high office and the impact on sterling and interest rates of a Labour victoryLast night's Conservative election broadcast questioned whether the electorate could trustMr Kinnock after he had changed his mind on nationalisationEuropeScottish devolution and unilateral

desperate that they're prepared to throw in the whole kitchen sink in their frantic bid for powerWith five days to polling dayTory strategists hope to focus the debate on which party is best placed to create a sustainable economic recoveryMr Major claimed yesterday that this was under wayI suspect we are on the way to recovery and coming out of recessionI can't statistically prove it yetBy the end of the year we might be able to look back and prove itbut we can't do it todayhe said on BBC radioAt the Conservatives' daily news conferenceMr Mellorthe Treasury Chief Secretaryrecalled the sharp fall in share prices on Wednesday after opinion polls indicating Labour had a clear leadTwo days ago we got a dire warning of what would happen under LabourJust a whiff of Labour was enough to set

recovery or a Labour slumpAttacking Labour's proposals to increase tax and national insurance for the better-offhe saidYou cannot tax a nation into revivalYou cannot stimulate success by a tax policy that penalises the successful and drives small traders bankruptMr Major also scorned Labour's attempt to woo voters by offering talks with other partiesparticularly the Liberal Democratson

candy flossMr Kinnockundertaking an intensive round of interviews after visiting Southamptoncontinued his efforts to woo wavering Liberal Democrats with the promise of a consensus governmentBut he

of negative campaigningThe Torieshe saidwere ashamedof their record on the recession and unemploymentMr Paddy Ashdown issued his starkest warning yet that he would be prepared to force a second

must have if there's an indecisive result is a stable governmentHe makes clear in an interview with the Times today that in a hung parliament his party would bargain very hard indeedto stop Labour

the problems likely to confront Britain in the next few decades and he or she will have no trouble answeringWhat is striking is that the responses bear almost no resemblance to the issues being discussed in the election campaignThere is an almost total disjunction between the big issues facing the country and the issues the politicians are willing to talk aboutIt is worth going through the list to see how great the disjunction isSomewhere near the top must come the so-called demographic time-bombOn current projectionsin 2001 there will be more than nine million people aged 65 or morewell over four million aged 75 or more and over a million aged 85 or moreOld-age pensioners will constitute 15 per cent of the population a figure expected to rise steeply in subsequent yearsThe consequences of this will be enormousFewer and fewer people of working age will have to support more and more people no longer earningThe take-home pay of the young will have to be substantially reduced to provide pensions for the increased numbers of elderlyMore special housing will be neededThe strains on the NHS and other social servicesalready greatwill grow inexorablyThe demographic time-bomb is ticking awayThe consequences of its exploding will be momentousYet the party leaders are silentAnother demographic change is altering and will alter even more in future the basic pattern of working and family lifeThe low birthrate of recent years means thatby the end of the decademuch of the world's work will be done by womenEleven million women are now in full or part-time employmentGovernment statisticians estimate that 96 per cent of the growth in the labour force between now and 2001 will be among womenThe consequences will again be momentousWill the birthrate continue to fallWho will look after the childrenBy 2001mothers looking after their children at homealready a vanishing specieswill be virtually extinctGovernmentswhatever their own inclinationswill have no choice but to fashion childcare policiesWhole generations of children will otherwise be in danger of emotional and physical neglectThe issues are already clearYet the politicians again have little to sayThe same is broadly true of AidsOfficial projections of the spread of Aids have mercifully been revised downwardsbut around 50,000 are believed to be infected in Britainand the disease is pandemic in parts of AfricaSome medical experts believe the chances of an explosive spread of the disease to Europeincluding Britaincannot be discountedThe list of 1992 non-issues can be extendedApart from the Liberal Democratsthe politicians are saying little about Britain's future relationship with the ECIn privatepoliticians discuss the wisdom of membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and widely predict a devaluation within the ERM whichever party is in power next weekendYet apart from a few scattered Tory voicesthere is no public debatePoliticians are also largely silent on how the next government will be able to carry out spending plans in view of the state of the productive economyEnvironmental issues resource depletionglobal warmingEngland's droughtthe degradation of cities and countryside likewise producefor electoral purposesa shrug of politicians' shouldersThe problems associated with nuclear powerand the imminent proliferation of nuclear weaponshave yet to produce a party election broadcastThe Green voice is hardly audiblePoliticians cannot reasonably be blamed for all thisThey are by nature reactive rather than pro-activeThere is nothing in the political system that forces them to consider the futureThey can protest that voters show little interest in the demographic timebombor childcare problemsYet general elections are supposed to be the grand inquest of the nationOn present formfuture generations are likely to look back on the 1992 election with its emphasis on marginal tax rates as at best rather quaintor at worst a tragic irrelevanceAnthony King is

BaildonThe cottage they bought 38 years ago for £4,500 will be swept away as the last unspoilt corner of the village becomes an estate of 150 homesMr Widdup64made it plain yesterday that he was unwilling to play the role of rural heroWe are not really crusaderswe are just human beings who want a quality of life in the way we have always donehe saidLast Decemberwhen £2 million was suggested as the likely price for their propertyMr Widdup and his 62-year-old wife made it clear they would not sell at any priceMr Widdup said he would not know what to do with the ludicrous amount of moneyThe Widdups vowed to stand firm even though the owners of the 11 acres surrounding their smallholding wanted to sellNow Labour-controlled Bradford council has supported outline building proposalsleaving the Widdups little option but to goThey expect to sell to a developer and move into a modern bungalow on 13 acres less than a mile awayMr Widdup saidHaving lost the planning battle it looked likely that we would have had to allow our property to be dug up for services like electricity and sewerageIt would have made life very uncomfortableA Daily Telegraph editorial last December said the Widdups' defiance of modern moguls enshrined a principle of high value the right of owners of private property to defy modern mogulsMay their goats flourishit concludedMr and Mrs Widdups' reluctant

was driven away to rest before his appearance at the London Palladium last nightMr Donovan had told the court that he was humiliated and disgustedby the article published in the magazine in August1991The accompanying photographa reproduction of a gay outingprotest posterdesigned to force homosexual celebrities into the openapparently showed him wearing a tee-shirt bearing the slogan Queer as ****The magazine described Mr Donovan as the boy with bleached hairalthough the actor told the court he had never used chemicals on his hair just lemon juice in the sun sometimesHe agreed he had once told journalists he was a male tartbut said this was a reference to his many relationships with womennot menHe also agreed that he once claimed surfing was better than sexand had said he could not be gay because he went surfingwhich he considered a largely heterosexual sportMr Nick Logan45managing director of the magazine's publishersWagadon Ltdthe company in which the Conde Nast group has a stakeand the writer of the articleMr Ben Summerskilldenied libelAfter the verdictMr Logan and the magazine's editorMs Sheryl Garratt31appeared close to tearsThe defendants had accepted unreservedlythat Mr Donovan was not homosexual but maintained that the article was a responsible discussion of outingwhich the magazine opposedIt had referred to Mr Donovan because he had been targeted as the first victim of the campaign in BritainMr Jonathon Crystaldefence counselsaid there would be an appeal against the amount of damages and was granted a stay of executionThe defendants in a statement said that they were very unhappywith the jury's decisionMr Logan and Mr Summerskill faced the prospect of financial ruin but would try to find resources to save the magazineJason Donovan has known for a long time that The Face is not richand we have repeatedly offered to apologise unreservedly for the articlethe statement addedThe Face never wanted this case to come to court

circumstancesSpending on education up by 20pc under ToriesBy John ClareEducation EditorSPENDING on all sectors of education has risen under the Conservatives by 20 per cent in real termsa study by the London School of Economics showed yesterdayContrary to Labour's claimsthe report said the proportion of national income spent on education is almost the same now 5.1 per centas it was when the Conservatives came to power in 1979 5.2 per cent It is a finding which invalidates Labour's pledge to spend billions restoringeducation's share of the national wealthThe studyby Mr Tony Traversshowed that spending on each primary school child increased by 41 per cent in real terms between 1980 and 1990Spending on each secondary school child rose by 53 per centHigher education and science also benefited from real increasesdisproving repeated claims of cutsby academics and othersMr Traverswho drew his figures from public expenditure White Paperssaid the sectors that enjoyed the biggest rises were education for the under-fives up nearly 90 per centand children with special needsboth favourite Labour targetsThe startlingfacts about increased education spending under the Tories would leave many parentsteachers and administrators gasping in disbelief as they pick their way through pot-holed playgrounds to book-starved classroomshe addedAs in the National Health Serviceperceptions of real life in public institutions do not fit well with the statisticsHe said capital spending on school buildings and equipment had been cut twice by Labour by 45 per centbetween 1974 and 1979 and by the Tories between 1981 and 1985when Sir Keith now LordJoseph was Education SecretaryThe effects of reduced capital spending have almost certainly created a backlog of repairs and replacements which still leads to the widely held view outside governmentthat the fabric of many schools remains poorAnother reason why people thought education was suffering continuing cuts despite the statistical evidence to the contrary was that the increased spending had not matched the improvements people saw in their homes and private spending powerHistoric building trust is ruined by squattersBy John GrigsbyLocal Government CorrespondentA LEADING organisation involved in the renovation of historic buildings has been forced into liquidation because families have squatted in the houses it restoredThe British Historic Buildings Trust is unable to pay architectsbuilders and financial backers because it cannot raise money from most of the 33 houses it repaired in Hanover SquareManninghamBradfordWest YorksUnder an agreement with the mostly Pakistani residentsthe trust bought for £1 each the dilapidated Grade II-listed homesdating from 1848–51after they had been threatened with demolitionThe trust agreed to renovate the houses and sell them back to their former owners for the cost of the work and the trust's expensesless the value of grants obtainedThe trust said the prices would generally amount to about two-thirds of their market value and those who could not afford to buy them could rent through a housing associationWhen the houses were readyprices of up to £51,000 were quotedSome people said their incomes were so low they could not obtain mortgages and 18 were squatted in by former occupants who refused to pay the moneyAn attempt to have them evicted failed because the county court judge ruled that the law only applied to people who had no interest in the propertyThe trust has failed to sell some of the other houses because of local concern about the squattersThe trustwhich has lost £153,000 on the projecthas restored about 200 properties and was prominent in preserving Pell Well Hall in Shropshire and the 12th century Siddington Barn near CirencesterGlosMr Alan Bemrosewho founded the trustsaid last nightIt is disastrousWe have to go into liquidation because these people broke the agreement and illegally occupied the housesIvana breaks vow of silence

with boys then aged between 11 and 13some of whom had been abused by their parents before being taken into careThe crimes only came to light in 1990 when one of Oldfield's victimsthen an adultwas himself charged with indecency to childrenThe story of the abuse he had suffered as a child emerged in interviews with social workersIt was the second time that Oldfielda bachelor and former public schoolboy from Crosby RoadBirkdaleSouthporthad come under suspicion for sexually abusing children in his careHe had been investigated in 1983 when a child complained that the trained social worker had

ruling that Berrya Norfolk businessman and ex-Royal Marinecould not have his case reopenedLord Lane said another division of the court had then felt powerless to intervene and hear new grounds of appeal because the House of Lords had restored Berry's conviction after an earlier successful appealThe difficulties in the case were caused by the Court of Appeal's earlier failure to rule on two of Berry's three grounds of appealsaid Lord Lanebut that did not preclude the Home Secretary from re-opening the caseBerryfrom BramertonNorfolkwas originally convicted in 1983 of making electronic timers for detonating bombs which it was claimed were intended for use in Syria and the LebanonHe had been tried jointly with another businessmanJeffrey Smithwho was eventually cleared at a retrialBerry's

the dayMr Jack CunninghamLabour's campaign co-ordinatorsaid on BBC TV's Breakfast Timethat Labour have made no decision about further sales of the Government's holding of stocks in companies that have

supporters in Richmond-upon-Thames are to be believedThe south-west London constituency of Richmond and Barnes is one of the top target seats for the Liberal Democratswhere they lie 1,776 votes behind the ConservativesIn 1983 the gap was just 74Nationallyalthough Gallup figures show that more women than men are intending to vote for Mr Ashdown's partysupport for the Liberal Democrat leader himself is equally divided between the sexesA straw poll in Richmond yesterday showed thatof 53 women who favoured the Liberal Democratsonly two mentioned Mr Ashdown as the principal reason for their choiceMrs Angela Smith30was typicalI like himI think he's a charming man and he's certainly better than Major or Kinnockwho both give me the creepsBut I would normally vote Labour and I'm voting Lib Dem because there's absolutely no point voting Labour in this seatNot all tactical votersof whom there are many in this affluent suburbwere so impressed by the high profile being given to Mr Ashdown and nobody else in the Liberal Democrat campaignHe closes his eyes when he speaks and I don't trust anyone who does thatsaid Miss Jayne Pooles34who works for the London ITV channelThames Televisionin

outright supporters of the Ashdown personality cultI do like himHe seems sensible and rather nice and he knows what he is talking aboutIn a way his personality does influence the way I would

typeyou knowwith smouldering eyesMrs Erica Chalkley65said she thought Mr Ashdown had leadership qualitiesbut she was unhappy about his military background and was glad on the wholethat he was not likely to be the next Prime MinisterHe is very charismaticisn't hebut possibly a bit more removedmore aloofthan the other leaderssaid Miss Cathryn Avison22a first-time voterLike most of the women questionedshe was quite willing to forgive Mr Ashdown for his extra-marital activitiesrevealed some weeks before the election campaign beganMiss Claire Darbourne28said she thought the five-year-old

least he admitted it and didn't make a big fussIt didn't change my mind about liking himThe Liberal Democrats may have wasted their money on the personality cult of Paddy Ashdownbut he is certainly

the £21,060 ceiling on national insurance payments and the introduction of a 50p rate of income tax for top earnersWith the Tories certain to vote against such higher taxesLabour would be defeated on

inquiry in a yearBy Jon HibbsPolitical StaffTHE RESULTS of Labour's inquiry into electoral reform for the House of Commons will be complete within a year of taking officeMr Kinnock promised yesterdayAs he intensified the party's efforts to lure floating voters away from the Liberal Democratsthe Labour leader made clear he had not ruled out holding a referendum on constitutional changeHowever his personal preference remained to put any proposals from the inquiry before the public at the next general electionInvitations to other political parties and representatives of businesstrade unions and churches would be sent out immediately in the wake of an election victory to broaden the membership of the party's working group under Prof Raymond PlantThe Plant committee was expected to report to the Labour Party conference in the autumnbut Mr Kinnock denied that turning it into an official government commission was a delaying tacticI do not think that will necessarily prolong the deliberations and the results will be available the further recommendations and the analysis within a yearthough I would not nominate a monthhe said on BBC Radio's World At OneEarlierduring a visit to Southamptonhe denied party strategy had been hi-jacked by the debate over proportional representationdisclosing that the decision to highlight constitutional issues on Democracy Day was taken a fortnight agoIn keeping with the increasingly presidential style of his campaignMr Kinnock arrived at the city's docklands development by helicopterand released 1,992 balloons to symbolise Southampton's links with EuropeAfter visiting a geothermal heating planthe took the opportunity of a walkabout in the shopping centre to mock Mr Major's use of a soapboxI guess simple people use themhe saidParallel to his attempt to portray Labour as a consensus governmentMr Kinnock sought to turn his confession of errors of judgmentover Europe and unilateralism into virtues in sharp contrast to Tory failure to apologise for Thatcher mistakesI actually think that people in a democracy respect a leader who will say I have not been right all the way along the lineI have no monopoly of wisdomI hope people understand this is a natural thing for any honest person to doIf you have been wrongacknowledge it and then get things right that is much better than pursuing ultimate follies like the poll taxhe saidMr Kinnock again declined to give his personal view about electoral reform lest the debate he initiated within the party two years ago became a test of loyalty to his leadershipHe has never been enthusiastic about itregarding the growing grassroots demand for proportional representation as a distraction from the main issues facing the partybut aides insist he now

MP is a Conservativeand hardly anyone that his name is Neville Trotterdefender of a slender 2,500 majorityBy most measures Meadowell is the worst council estate in Britainand probably the most notorious since the riots last Septemberwhich followed the deaths of joyriders Colin Atkins and Dale Robson in a police chaseIn fact Meadowell is an Elastoplast name like Sizewellinvented in the 1970s to disguise what was already a running soreWhen built in 1938 it was The Ridgeswhich is still what they call it locally a slum clearance project on the north bank of the Tyne10 miles east of NewcastleIts first inhabitants were shipyard and fishquay workers from the riverside towns of North Shields and Wallsendwho moved happily from their tumbledown terraces to these fine new houses with

something was wrong from the startSome say it was the importing of whole streets of fighting families from the fishquayswith their dockland diversions of prostitutiondrug-dealing and handlingOthers say it was the shortage of pubsshopschurchestransport and police stationsBy the 1950sThe Ridges was the criminal ghetto of Newcastleand by the 1970s a costly council manicure job had turned it into a free-fire zonePaths and boundaries vanishedallowing the tides of street life to wash right up to the doorstepsJoyriders used front lawns to practise their handbrake turnsCar theft became so common that private cars virtually disappeared from the areaShops like greengrocers and chippieswith pitiful cash takingswere routinely subjected to armed robberies with shotgunsbalaclavas the whole bitWhen I ask the fat ladies at the drop-in centre what is the one thing that would do most to improve the estate they say get rid of the kidsand they are only half jokingThe age structure of Meadowell means it is awash with teenagerswhose only pastimes are having babies and body-buildingDo your husbands come hereI askand they all laughThe men are all useless sitting indoors if there's trouble in the streetIt's women have to go out and deal with itBy the time of the riots a quarter of all houses on the estate were boarded up and burned out by infant petrol bombersUnemployment was 80 per cent on some streetsIn Meadowell Primarywhich has 232 childrenevery one was receiving a clothing grantThe area had effectively been abandoned by the authoritiesa fact which became clear during the riot

Conservative election broadcastwhich invited Tory supporters to telephone Labour's London headquarters to complain over the way it gave prominence to bad newsabout BritainThe broadcast sought to contrast the record of the past 13 years of Tory rule with Labour's Winter of Discontent in 1978–79It also launched a fierce personal attack on Mr Kinnock's fitness for high officehighlighting his changes of view on nationalisationScottish devolutionnuclear disarmament and European Community membershipDescribing the Labour leader as a former leader of the hard leftit said people can't trust a man who will change any principleabandon any policysay anything to get electedBut the most controversial feature of the broadcast was the inclusion of the telephone number of Labour's headquartersThe broadcast began with an upbeat picture of life in Britain asking the viewers if they recognised which country it wasThere were clips of interviews with people in FranceGermanyItaly and Holland saying it was not their countryThe country we are describing is Britainand Labour don't seem to recognise itLabour have been talking Britain down so hardrelishing every piece of bad newsrubbing their hands at any failure in public servicesthat they have chosen to forget what a great country Britain really issaid the broadcastIt then invited people to ring Labour's headquartersLabour launched an immediate protest over what they described as a pathetic prankand voiced concern that their legitimate work as a political party in the election campaign could be affected if their switchboard was jammedBut the Tories were unrepentantdeclaring that the broadcast was making a pointand the telephone number was already publicly available in the telephone bookThe broadcastwhich featured Mr HurdForeign Secretaryand Mr HeseltineEnvironment Secretaryacknowledged there had been a recession which had caused pain for some peopleIt addedIt would be a tragedy if the frustrations and the

media briefing in London yesterdayHe said his Bill to abolish the council tax would be accompanied by the immediate commencement of the process of introducing fair ratesThe second priority would be to introduce a Bill establishing a Scottish Parliamentwhich would have its second reading before the summer recessThe third would be a Freedom of Information Billwhich would be an essential component of

stockbrokersadvertising agencies and banking houses are paying substantial bonuses to their high-earning staff to beat the effects of a substantial increase in taxes in the wake of a possible Labour victory on April 9Some companies are also reported to be paying several months' salary in advance of the electionThe number of advances made in the past few days has sharply increased as companies attempt to match their rivals and allay the tax fears of senior staffPart of the reason behind the payments is to placate high earnerssome of whom are asking to be moved to overseas branches of their companies to avoid higher taxesAll of these people would be affected by the Labour proposals to introduce a new top income tax rate of 50 per centand to extend national insurance contributions on salaries above £21,000One stockbroking source said last nightThere are a certain number of people who have already saidListenif I'm going to get clobberedI would rather be transferredor maybe I could find someone else who can transfer meThese people have leverageSo when some City and other British institutions start doing something for their employees and offering them something to alleviate their fearsthe others are likely to match itThe fact that there is an election has got everything to do with thisBonuses make up an important part of their total annual earningsEssentially you have a lot of people who are very highly paidThey have a good base salary but make more than that out of bonusesthe source saidOne of the stockbrokers who have been making bonus payments in recent days is Salomon BrothersA company spokesman said last night that Salomon had acted in response to payments being made by other institutionsThe special mid-year payments were being made in advancebased on performances last yearIt was essentially decided to do this because major institutions in the City were offering their employees an opportunityWe have been here under many governments since 1971 and will continue

ablest politicians was invoking the name of his mentorMichael Forsyththe Scottish Office minister whose portfolio includes two of the most hotly debated issues of the election campaign health and education had just been formally adopted by his constituency association to contest the Stirling seatWith one of the slenderest majorities to defend anywhere in the countryMr Forsyth could be forgiven if he looked worriedBut herein the heart of rural Stirlingshire and surrounded by the party faithfulhe is in good formInside the hall there was no dissent but outside Mr Forsythlong since dubbed Mrs

pro-Tory swing of the campaignSix candidates are contesting this sprawling seatwhich stretches from the historic town of Stirlingnorth and west to CrianlarichMr Forsyth is in ebullient mood and is fighting his campaign on his record as a constituency MPHe regards a recent remark by the Labour leader of Stirling district council that he interferes more in local issues than any other MP in Scotlandas a tributeLabour's Kate Phillipsa 45-year-old freelance adviser to Third World aid agencieswho has used the year since her selection to raise her profile locallyis in tigerish moodShe insists she is the established challenger to Mr Forsyth's crown and argues that he has not appeared particularly sure-footed during the campaignMs Phillipslike the Scottish National Party's candidate Gerry Fisherhas been making a big play for the student votewhich could prove critical in thisScotland's second most marginal constituencyA campaign by Stirling University students association while officially non-political to persuade those living elsewhere in Britain to register for a postal votehas been a big successMr Forsyth's support for student loans has ensured little support for him on the campus butthat apartthe student vote seems to be as divided as it is in the wider constituencyIn 1987 the SNP trailed the three other parties with a lowly 10.7 per cent but this time says Mr

clever wee chielchildand as one raised in a hard debating school says he would relish a public debate with the Scottish Office Minister and the other candidatesMr Fisher believes that Mr Forsyth's vocal support of the union can only help the nationalistsbut his real target is the Labour voteThe Tories could profit from this switch of allegiance andwith the opposition vote splitMr Forsyth could get homeWillie Robertson42the Liberal Democrat candidatejoined the party just three years ago but has an unbridled enthusiasm for the stump and feels that a sizeable proportion of Tories disaffected

some safeseatsPoll tax evasion is thought to be the main reason for the falling numbersFigures from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys show that the number of voters is significantly less than at the time of the 1987 electioneven though the adult population has grownThe independent Electoral Reform Society said the drop was largely due to efforts to evade the poll taxThe biggest drop is in Hackneyeast Londonwhich has two safe Labour seatsThe electorate has fallen by 24,985 more than 18 per centsince 1987The number of voters missing in the Labour seats held by Ms Diane Abbott and Mr Brian Sedgemore is in each case about twice the size of their majorityMore worryingly for Labourin six key target seats the number disappearing from the electoral rolls is higher than the majority it is trying to overturnIn Hampstead and Highgatenorth Londonwhere Miss Glenda Jackson is trying to overturn a Tory majority of 2,221the register has dropped by 5,156and in Hornsey and Wood Greennorth Londonthe chances of Labour reversing a 1,779 Conservative lead may be hit by the disappearance of 6,673 names from the listThe majorities in Labour target seats are also smaller than the reduction in the rolls in DulwichStreathamGreenwich and WallaseyThe Electoral Reform Society believes most of those who have gone off the rolls are potential Labour supportersif only because of their assumed strong opposition to the poll taxLabour argues that it will not be significantly affected because most of those who evade the register would have been among the large proportion between 20.1 per cent and 31.2 per cent in their top 10 target constituencies who did not vote in 1987Ms Abbott pointed out that although there are 12,000 fewer voters on her Hackney North and Stoke Newington registeronly 55 per cent of registered voters visited the ballot box in June 1987Mr Simon Osbornof the Electoral Reform SocietysaidIt would be unsafe for Labour to assume that all these people are non-votersIf it

II-listed homesdating from 1848–51after they had been threatened with demolitionThe trust agreed to renovate the houses and sell them back to their former owners for the cost of the work and the trust's expensesless the value of grants obtainedThe trust said prices would be about two-thirds of market value and those who could not afford to buy could rent them through a housing associationWhen the houses were readyprices of up to £51,000 were quotedSome people said that their incomes were so low that they could not obtain mortgages and 18 were squatted in by former occupants who refused to pay the moneyAn attempt to have them evicted failed because the county court judge ruled that the law only applied to people who had no interest in the propertyThe trust has failed to sell some of the

yesterday in the scattered communities near the factory car park where an American EF-111 jet crashed on Thursday just yards from where 45 people were workingMany locals were angry that the pilot and his electronic warfare officer ejected from their crashing plane too soon to ensure it would not hit buildings at Barton Hartshornnear BuckinghamMrs Margaret Charlesliving 200 yards from the crashsaidI am furious because I do not think pilots should just bale out and let the plane go on and crash into a villageI am still very shaken and will be taking it up with the American authoritiesMr Patrick Fitzgibbonwho lives in Steeple Astonsaid he was deeply concerned that the pilot ejected one and a half miles from the crash siteIn 1969an American jet crashed 200 yards from the school in Steeple AstonThe pilot stayed with his aircraft and steered it away from the school and bravely died with it to save othersIn those daysit was standing orders for a pilot to stay with his plane until it was definitely safeIn this casethe crew ejected and left the plane to fly on its ownCampaigners living near the base called for all flights to be suspended pending an investigation but a spokesman said operations would continue as normalThe plane crashed near a crossroads one mile from three villages but the Dalgety seed processing plantwhich almost took the impactis surrounded by fields and isolated housesMr Paul Bagnigeneral manager of DalgetysaidI am convinced the pilot was aiming for an old airfield behind our plant but came down just short of itThere were suggestions from the

the country's normally tame parliamentarians rebuffed him by rewriting his government reportDelegates to the National People's Congress NPCmade more than 150 changes to Li's work report to include a warning against hard-line Marxism and to stress support for economic reformsThey also departed from their rubber-stamp tradition in a vote on the controversial Three Gorges dam project on the Yangtze riverThe scheme was approvedbut amid strong oppositionThe changes to Li's report seem bound to weaken his position at an important juncture in China's political lifeThey will boost Communist Party reformerswho are battling hard-line opponents before a crucial autumn party congressWhen the first draft of Li's report was presented a fortnight ago it incorporated many of the demands for faster reform voiced earlier this year by China's elder statesmanDeng XiaopingBut it omitted any reference to the dangers of Leftismdespite the fact that Deng had stressed thisand that it was at the heart of a party politburo statementThe delegates added a clause sayingWhile watching out for Rightist deviationswe must guard mainly against Leftist deviationsThe NPC ended its annual session yesterday by passing all laws and reports put before itbut dissent was far greater than it has been in the years following the 1989 crackdown in Pekingwhich Li played a leading role inNearly a third of the 2,633 votes cast on the huge dam project took the form of abstentions or novotesBefore the result was announcedtwo deputies representing Taiwan stood up and shouted out their opposition to the £6 billion hydro-electric and flood control schemebefore storming outThe vote means that the project will be included in the current 10-year development planBut the Bill provides room for manoeuvring and perhaps an indefinite delay by allowing the government to choose an appropriate time to proceed based on the state's financial abilitiesHeated debate over the dam project took place during the 15-day NPC sessionwith many delegates opposing it for environmental and financial reasonsInternationalBritons ignore warnings of danger and remain in LibyaBy Alan PhilpsDiplomatic CorrespondentBRITISH diplomats

the Westnot to mention Amman's upper class and political establishmentWestern diplomats believe that the Islamic movement will grow unless the economic crisiscaused in large part by the Gulf waris resolved and some progress is made in peace talks with IsraelThe Muslim Brotherhoodfor its partseeks to reassure the doubtersThe Islamic movement is a reformist movement based on the principles and creed of the nationsaid Mr Arebeyat59who studied agriculture in AmericaWe are democrats who believe in pluralismin a modern state and human rightsMr Arebeyat praised the moderation of Jordanthe wise leadership of King Hussein and the development of democracyThere was none of the familiar denunciations against the West and no talk of replacing the system with an Islamic stateEven denunciations of Israelthe Zionist enemysomehow lacked the usual venomThe Islamic movement in Jordan opposes the peace talks with Israelbut it is not actively opposing regional peace negotiationsIt is almost a rule of Middle East politics that democracy in Arab states means the emergence of a strong Islamic movementThe process went so far in Algeria earlier this year that the army cancelled the results of general elections when it became clear that the Islamic Salvation Front would win an overwhelming victoryIn Jordanwhere the authorities hope the experiment in democracy will become a model for other Arab statesKing Hussein has opted so far to draw the fundamentalists into the governmentDr Mahmoud al-ShariefJordan's Information Ministersaid the best antidote to radical Islam was to give fundamentalists some power rather than jail sentencesto make them deal with the world as it is rather than as they imagine it to beHe addedThe best way to get rid of them is to baptise them in powerThe Muslim

Europe eludes tongue-tied BritishBy Boris JohnsonEC Correspondentin BrusselsTHE GOVERNMENT will have to redouble its efforts to put British politicians and civil servants at the heart of Europeafter a new poll yesterday showed that they are the least accomplished linguists in the ECOf the 1,500 senior Brussels-based politicians and civil servantsthe BritishFrench and Irish continue to show the most splendid ignorance of the eight official EC languages other than their ownThe surveypublished in Dod's European Companiononce again confirms the Dutch as the most effortless prattlerswith 77 per cent capable of holding a conversation in two or more languages other than their ownThey are followed by the Portuguese and Belgianswith 69 per cent and 66 per cent capable of the same featIt is no surpriseperhapsthat the British and French are the most tongue-tied of allwith only 27 per cent boasting three languagesAs representatives of the two most ancient and chauvinistic patries of the

wonderful and unique wildlife heritage to overcome what we hope is a short-term problem of droughtMr Nujoma appealed to the international community for aid to counter the country's worst drought for 30 yearsHe saidI have no option but to declare an emergency situationAll natural resources must be utilised to provide food for the needyHe did not stipulate which animals might be killed to provide

DECADE after the Argentinians invadedthe Falkland Islands face a massive new advance from an iceberg the size of BuckinghamshireThe giant berg broke free from the Antarctic peninsula last Augustthreatening to cause havoc in the shipping lanes of the South AtlanticAfter a period of being grounded on the Shag Rocksit has now confounded weather experts by drifting westdirectly towards the FalklandsForecasters thought the iceberg once measuring 65 miles by 50 milesand now measuring 35 miles by 20 would continue drifting eastwards towards the island of South Georgia and onwards towards South Africabreaking up and melting on the wayBut satellite pictures received by the weather centre at the Falklands military base now show the iceberg moving straight towards the FalklandsIt is approximately 300 miles from the islandsCrews of an RAF TriStarwhich flies a twice-weekly service between the Falklands and Britainsay they can see the berg as they approach and leave the islandsPassengers also enjoy the spectacular viewThe iceberg is moving at about five miles a daysaid Principal Met Officer Ken IngermallsHe said he could not explain why the iceberg was moving west and not east as everyone had anticipatedMr Ingermalls addedPerhaps it's some underwater current that we are unaware of which is causing this unusual phenomenonAn army parade and memorial services were

about proportional representationThe Tories regard it as an aberration that would be catastrophic for Britain's system of governmentThe Liberal Democrats support it as their one chance of grasping real political powerMeanwhileNeil Kinnockleader of the one party that could actually bring PR aboutis refusing to say where Labour stands on the issuePressed to do so in a television interview on Thursday night with Sir Robin DayMr Kinnock allowed that he had formed a viewbut he was not prepared to disclose itOn an issue of such constitutional significancethis is a disgraceful evasionLabour simply cannot fudge its views on PRAs Roy Hattersleyhimself an opponent of the schemereminded journalists yesterdayproportional representation would involve a radical change from one form of democracy to anotherit isn't something which can be taken lightlyYet Mr Kinnockrepeating the offer he has made to the Liberal Democrats of a committee of inquiry into electoral reformhas upped the stakes by speaking of a commitment to reform Britain's constitution by consensusWhat needs to be spelt out very clearly before polling day is that PR would bring about the opposite effect to what many voters comfortably believeA vote for PRas represented by the Liberal Democratsis not a vote for fairnessbut for injusticenot a vote for stabilitybut for political chaosTake the example of Belgium whereas the Prime Minister pointed out on ThursdayPR has created a political culture of backstairs deals and perpetual campaigningTake the example of Italywhere proportional representation has created permanent instabilitywith a series of coalition governments that have had to depend on several minor parties whose influence has been out of all proportion to their success in the pollsIf anybody wishes to see just how pernicious that influence can bethey can look at the Likud government in Israelwhich has had to impose repressive legislation at the behest of religious extremists who hold the balance of powerPR much dilutedhas been an indisputable success only in Germanywhich has enjoyeduntil recentlya natural consensus between its political partiesfounded on the need for regenerationIn Britainunder PRno government since the Second World War would have won an overall majorityWe should have hadat besta continuous middle-of-the-road government which could never have taken radical reforming

of his series on the leadersFrank Johnson reportsBy FRANK JOHNSONWE WERE in the West CountryThe Prime Minister was on his soapboxJust up the roadat Langport in Somersetwas the birthplace of Walter Bagehot 1826–1877although as he directed his microphone at Liberal Democrat hecklers John Major had other things on his mindThe relevance is that Bagehot was the first political commentatorThe travelling chaos of a modern party leader's election entourage had carried Major within a few miles of the home of the founder of the professiona few of whose more troublesome contemporary practitioners are said to have caused him much irritation over the 16 months of his premiershipA LiberalHe's admitted to being a LiberalMajor criedjabbing a finger in the direction of one hecklerThe man had a Liberal Democrat rosette pinned to his capHe was also carrying an orange poster on a poleurging a vote for the local Liberal Democrat candidateTherefore the admission which the Prime Minister wrung from him could hardly be said to have been grudgingButlike all the best soapbox oratorsMajor had prepared his repartee in advanceI knew there was one herehe continuedmeaning Liberal DemocratsThere werein factabout a scoreThen came the passagewhich appeared on the television news that evening and in the papers the next dayabout the Liberal Democrats being the Trojan horse that would let Labour inThere were also some lines intended for local consumptionHigher petrol prices from the Liberal Democratsthat's not gonna help a rural areaWhat would Bagehot have made of himLike the hecklerhe was a LiberalThere the similarity endssince judging from his writings Bagehot was a roaring snobwhereas judging from his heckles the heckler was notMore to the pointit was Bagehot who saidA constitutional statesman is in general a man of common opinions and uncommon abilitiesThe statesman to whom he was referring was PeelA political commentator of our own dayPaul Johnsonquoted it not long after Major became Prime Minister to suggest that it was also true of himBut is it stillB AGEHOT'S phrase comes in a passage in which he appears to propound the dispiriting theory that a politicianif he wants to get anywheremust appeal to the average manThe average man is a coolcommon personwith a considerate airwith figures in his mindwith his own business to attend towith a set of ordinary opinions arising from and suited to ordinary lifeHe can't bear novelty or originalitiesOriginal theories give troubleBagehot goes on to say of PeelFrom a certain peculiarity of intellect and fortunehe was never in advance of his timeOf almost all the great measures with which his name is associatedhe attained great eminence as an opponent before he attained even greater eminence as their advocateThat last sentence has more to do with Kinnock than with MajorIt is also a warning to all hack Tories who think that it is a telling blow against Kinnock to keep on pointing out that he has reversed his opinions about unilateral nuclear disarmamentBritish membership of the ECor anything elseBut the most striking thing about Bagehot's essay on Peelin the light of the last full week of this election campaignis that it simply does not apply to Major at allCommon opinions were what got Major into difficulties in the first placeBetween his becoming Prime Minister and his party's fall in the polls about 10 days agoMajor did nearly everthing that common opinion wanted him to doThis was true of what he did about both high policy and low politicsFor exampleon high policy common opinion said that there was nothing for it but to stay in the ERMHe stayed inand the recession worsenedIn low politicscommon opinion no less common for being expensively hired by Conservative Central Office encouraged him in the belief that he should fight much of the election sitting downHe did soand he looked like the questioner in the studio audience rather than the answererThe result was Wobbly Weekthe second week of the campaignBut last Saturday Major climbed on to that soapbox in LutonUntil thenhe had been that most inhuman of creatures the public figure described by others as very humanNow he really was human unscriptedjokeyeven a bit passionateThe jubilant word from Kinnock's camp was that Major was behaving more like an opposition leader than a prime ministerBut there seemed nothing wrong with the head of government appearing to be the challenger on the hustingsPresident Truman did so in a campaign which no-one expected him to winand he wonIt is justified if the head of government is challenging something powerfulKinnock complains of the alleged power of the Tory tabloid pressbut he has powers on his side tooNinety per cent of his party's cash comes from the unionswhich will expect a returnThe British people have in the past found them rather more powerful than the corporations which are popularly supposed to finance the Conservative partyThen there are all those schoolteachersdonstelevision producerswriters on arts pages and members of the agitating classes who want a Labour win in order to impose Political CorrectnessThat is to saythey will have what the Jesuits once attached such importance topower over young or impressionable mindsAs the week went byMajor rejected common opinion about two other large subjectsproportional representation and Scottish devolutionHe hardened his opposition to bothdespite the fact that his own party chairman had once favoured the firstand vocal forces within his Scottish party were in support of the secondE VEN at this late hourpsephologydemographics and luck suggest that the Tories could still emerge as the biggest single party in a hung ParliamentIs it possible that Major would rather go into opposition with the dangers that would mean for his continued leadership of the Conservative party than offer PR and Scottish devolution to the Liberal DemocratsIf sowe are dealing with a more Quixoticromantic or principled figure than some of us used to thinkOnce that soapbox came outMajor campaigned as if he would now do and say what he really thoughtWas it too lateFrom Central Officeand

implicationssaid Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lawrence RoachMany of our recent troubles in retaining and maintaining public confidence might have been less severe and more easily solved if we had not begun to depart from the traditional relationships between rankshe addedWriting in the influential Police Review magazineMr Roachhead of policing for north-west London and a member of the Association of Chief Police Officerssaid thatsince the time of Sir Robert Peelthe police had always had to reassure the public that their powers and privileges would not be misusedPeel's response was to construct a service with a severe code of discipline and a structure of supervisory ranks designed to ensure strict control of policing and police officersIt is for the protection of the public that police officers are subject tothiscodewhich reaches into every aspect of their professional duties and into much of their private livesWhen junior officers salutedthey were recognising the authority vested in them by Parliamenthe arguedIt was not a simply a courtly ritual or a question of deference but an acceptance of the office and powers their superiors heldIf a senior officer were to be viewed as no more than a member of an amorphous managerial teamsaid Mr Roachthe public would be led to believe that any complaint against a policemen was merely being investigated by one of the boysFar from departing from the traditional view of the relationship between ranksthe moment has come for a return to itsaid Mr RoachThe time is ripe to abandon not the rank structure but the tendency to impart fashionable management theories which are not necessarily appropriate to policing and which only confuse supervisors throughout the serviceThe benefits of such a development would be a renewal of public confidence and a reawakening of the morale of police officers of all ranksMr Roach stressed yesterday that his views were personal and were an attempt to defend the status quo in the police

served in the US Army Signals Corps during the latter stages of the First World War before settling in OnawaIowawhere he worked as a teacher and ran a sweetshop in his spare timeOne day in 1921 an eight-year-old boy walked into the shopThe child could not decide whever he wanted a chocolate bar or a scoop of ice creamit occurred to Nelson to combine the twoAfter months of experimentation he came up with a vanilla ice cream bar on a stickbonded with cocoa butter to a coating of chocolateInitiallyNelson called this the I-ScreambarThis was because a slogan which he himself coined had been set to music and became a hit tune of the periodI-Screamyou screamWE all screamFOR ICE CREAMNelsonhoweverfeared that once the song was no longer in voguehis product would become similarly unfashionableHe accordingly renamed it the Eskimo Pieand chose the distinctive Eskimo symbol that still appears on the wrappingThe bar was patented and Nelson duly became president of the Eskimo Pie CorporationThe popularity of these treats was enormousand Nelson had to redirect his inventiveness towards devising new production methods to meet the burgeoning demandHe invented a precursor of the high-speed continuous extrusion freezer which could cut novelties out of slabs of vanilla ice creamThe original version of this machine which Nelson eventually patented in 1955 could cut about a dozen bars a minutethe version now in use can cut up to 400 a minuteAt the same time Nelson invented a freezer for ready-made productsnow known to the frozen food industry as the Nelson BoxThis device froze mini-slabs of ice cream at -40 degrees Farenheitwhich made them hard enough to be sealed with warm chocolateNelson sold the Eskimo Pie Corporation to the US Foil Company now the Reynolds Metal
