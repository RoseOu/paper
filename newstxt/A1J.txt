The Bar ConferenceDonaldson sets the tone for battle over rights of audienceBy PATRICIA WYNN DAVIESLegal CorrespondentBARRISTERS could retain much of their monopoly over advocacy in the higher courts under a subtle agenda for discussion spelled out by Lord Donaldsonthe Master of the Rollsas he opened the Bar's annual conference in London at the weekendSignalling the beginning of a lower-key campaign against the plans of the Lord ChancellorLord Mackay of Clashfernto give increased rights of audience in the High and Crown court to solicitorsLord Donaldson called on the Bar to put aside the traumathe acrimony and the recriminationswhich followed Lord Mackay's Green Papers and to abandon the hustingsLord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn's Bill were total freedom of choice for the clientunless the interests of justice otherwise requireWhen those concerned turn their attention to this problemthey may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is availableIn the first category we have criminal casesjudicial review and cases which involve matrimonial status and the welfare of children or those under a disabilityIn many of themparticularly criminal casesthe interests of the client may be quite different from those of the publicIn these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such asfor example that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent handsIn the second categorygeneral civil casesparties should be able to choose their own lawyers because the interests of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client's right of choiceLord Donaldson impliedhoweverthat solicitors who exercised their new rights of audience in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacyWhile emphasising that he had not reached any firm conclusionsLord Donaldson's voice will be a powerful one in behind-the-scenes manoeuvres as rules governing the exercise of the new advocacy rights are hammered out away from the parliamentary battlefieldThe rules will be drawn up by the Law Society having regardto suggestions made by a new lay-dominated independent advisory committee on legal education and conductThey will have to be approved by the Lord Chancellor and be subject to the concurrenceof four senior Supreme Court judgesof whom Lord Donaldson will be oneIn practiceinitial drafts of rules will be the subject of ongoing discussions between all four partiesThe four will have to have regard to the interest of justiceobjectiveBut on the other handthe statute will also include a clear intention that extended rights of audience are put into practical effect as soon as the necessary conditions have been metA majority of judges said in their response to the Green Papers that standards of conduct and competence might decline if lawyers who worked in partnerships and took instructions directly from clients most solicitorswere allowed widespread access to the higher courtsLord Donaldson's formula for settling the rights of audience controversy was viewed as an adept political move by some delegatesAlternative dividing lines which have been informally mootedsuch as simply restricting solicitor-advocates in Crown Court jury trials to the less serious caseshad been viewed as difficult to support as a matter of principleLord Donaldson's remarks were greeted with cautious enthusiasm by Bar leadersDesmond FennellQCthe Bar's chairmansaid that he was greatly encouragedby Lord Donaldson's indication that the interests of justice objective would prevailRoger HendersonQCthe Bar's public affairs spokesmanwarned that the words used in the White Paper were open to different interpretationsbut saidLord Donaldson has plainly interpreted the White Paper on the basis that there has been a major change from the Green PaperJohn Hayessecretary general of the Law Societysaid he regarded the entire matter as up for debateWe look forward to the discussionsThe Master of the Rolls has always been keen to find a middle wayLord Donaldson attacked the White Paper's suggestion that it might be in the public interest to allow other professionssuch as accountantsto be given rights of audience in the courtsThe Bar ConferenceAid fund for injury claims should be testedBy PATRICIA WYNN DAVIESLegal CorrespondentA TRIAL SCHEME should be set up to assess the validity of a contingent legal aid fund to finance personal injury claims for those too well-off to qualify for legal aid but too poor to pay feesthe conference was toldUnder the schemesuccessful claimants would pay about 10 per cent of their winnings to a central fund which would meet the costs of unsuccessful claimsGeorge PulmanQCa member of the Bar Council's working party on contingent feestold a conference workshop on financing litigation that unlike other forms of contingency fee arrangementlawyers would have no personal interest in the outcome of litigation and there would be no legal aid blackmailwhere cases are legally aided the normal costs follow the eventrule does not apply and defendants have to meet their own costs even when they winIn working out the percentage deduction from the damages of successful claimantscomparison should be made with trade union funded personal injury litigation where costs were paid to winning defendantsMy initial inquiries suggest that a figure of significantly less than 10 per cent is a real possibilityMr Pulman saidInitial government money would be needed to get the scheme off the groundBut Mr Pulman estimated that could be repaid within two yearsA four-year trial scheme should be set up using firms outside London specialising in actions for trade union membersLegal Aid Board proposals to grant franchisesto selected solicitors' firms doing legal aid advice work under the green formscheme will enable the board and lawyers to jointly improve the systemJohn Pittsthe board chairmansaidIn return for assurances of service to a defined qualityfranchised firms would enjoy benefits such as easier administrationdevolved responsibility for some aspects of case managementand faster paymentJohn Hayessecretary-general of the Law Societysaid the advantages ought to apply to all solicitors and the board should not seek to produce artificial criteria for selectionThere should be a much higher threshold at which solicitors would need to consult the boardThe system I would like to see is solicitors being given the job of approving up to Â£500 of legal aid workwith spot checks on qualitytaking off any who are found to have abused itThe means test for all legal aid work could also be simplified and handled directly by solicitorsagain subject to careful spot check monitoringMr Hayes saidThe Bar ConferencePlea for new lawyer-freehearings on small claimsBy PATRICIA WYNN DAVIESLegal CorrespondentA LAWYER-FREE small claims procedureeasily operated by the do-it-yourself litigant and staffed by a new body of volunteer civil justicesis needed to combat problems of cost and delay Lord Donaldsonthe Master of the RollssaidThe new breed of civil justices would be similar to JPs in the criminal field but would act as arbitrators in county courtsThe only qualifications they would need would be common sensea judicial temperament and an elementary knowledge of the limited aspects of the law which are applicable to such disputesLord Donaldson saidAt the risk of deeply shocking youI have to say that in relation to small claimswe have to get rid of the lawyersThey were overqualified and not cost-effective for small casesHe addedThe aim must be to produce small claims procedures which can be understood and followed by the do-it-yourself litigantIf assistance was needed it should be provided by the courts themselvesby Citizens Advice Bureaux or by similar agenciesIn the minority of cases where representation was really needed it should be provided by para-legalsable to charge lessin line with their lower qualifications and overheadsLord Donaldson said afterwards that his proposal would not lead to a downgrading of justiceAt the moment county court registrars are often just using their common sensenot their knowledge of lawI can't see why the ordinary housewife shouldn't do itHe predicted there would be no shortage of volunteerswho could acquire the necessary skills on short coursesThere is nothing so fascinating as other people's disputesThe system outlined by Lord Donaldsona man not known for his left tendenciesbears marked similarities to those operated in a number of eastern bloc countriesThe drift of his remarks is likely to find favour with the Lord ChancellorLord Mackay of Clashfernwho said last year that many litigants wanted fuller participation in the legal process rather than acting as bystanders in cases conducted by lawyersLord Donaldson then attacked Lord Mackay's White Paper proposals for banks and building societies to undertake conveyancingAlthough the near-monopoly enjoyed by solicitors was indefensible because it related only to the preparation of documentsthere is a real need for consumer protection and I am far from sure that the White Paper proposals meet this needhe saidConveyancing documents should include a certificate by the purchaser saying either that he had been fully advised by a wholly independent practitioner or that he had declined such advice and the certificate should contain a prominent health warningagainst declining to take itThe Bar ConferenceCommercial judges need highest payBy PATRICIA WYNN DAVIESLegal CorrespondentJUDGES in the Commercial Court should get higher salaries than other High Court colleaguesthe conference heardThere was a pressing need for more judges to help to reduce increasing delaysRichard Williamsa solicitorsaidThe unedifying scramble for a free judge causes great embarrassment to solicitors vis-a-vis their clientsExtra appointments could be financed by the court's customers paying higher charges when cases were set down for trialA more difficult problem was ensuring the extra judges were of a sufficiently high calibreIf more judges are required because of the greater degree of litigious activity it is logical to assume that those successful counsel of high calibre who would be candidates for judge's office would find it economically more gratifying to remain as advocateshe saidBearing in mind the commercial raison d'etre of the courtthere was a case for paying its judges more than those in other divisionsThere could also be a Commercial Court of Appeal with its ownhigher paidjudgesMr Williams said delay was the main complaint solicitors faced from clientsThe Bar ConferenceChildren's recollection usually reliable says psychiatristBy PATRICIA WYNN DAVIESLegal CorrespondentRESEARCH shows that a child's recall is usually accurateand errors are of omission rather than commissionDr Danya Glasera consultant child psychiatristsaidBut this does not ensure credibilitywhich is related to the way the child's account is obtainedIf details are requested whichfrom the child's point of vieware peripheral to the event and therefore not recalledthe child may feel obliged to fabricate oneResearch had found that even very young children do not go alongwith erroneous suggestions concerning the essence of their experiencesIt was vital to take account of children's cognitive and emotional responses when evaluating their evidenceDenial is present in 85 per cent to 90 per cent of casesIt is in this context that a reticenthesitant and anxious accountsometimes followed by a retractionis likely to be credibleshe saidThe Bar ConferenceBarristers in sex trials defendedBy PATRICIA WYNN DAVIESLegal CorrespondentREPEATED attacks on cross-examination by defence barristers of the victims of alleged sexual offences were misplaced and naiveDavid Cocks QCchairman of the Criminal Bar Associationtold the conferenceCross-examination was the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truthhe saidMr Cocks predicted that advocates would have to adapt their techniques in cases involving children and other vulnerable witnessesbut warnedIt would be disastrous for an excessive preoccupation with welfare to erode the defendant's rights and to undermine the role of his advocateThe climate of opinion that children never lie about sexual abuse was dangeroushe addedMr Cocks also criticised judges for making uninformed pronouncements about whether child witnesses were old enough to give evidenceUnder the Children and Young Persons Act 1933judges must be satisfied that the child is of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of the evidence and understands the duty of telling the truthIn practicechildren under the age of eight are rarely called as witnesses and judges still follow a 1958 House of Lords ruling that a jury could not attach any importance to the evidence of a child of fiveThis is a subject on which judges needand should haveexpert assistance from a clinical psychologist and not be left to flounder through what may be an ill-informed and perfunctory form of inquisition before the child gives evidenceMr Cocks went on to criticise video interviewing techniques of police and social workersMight there not be a case for putting the initial interview in the hands of an educational psychologist skilled in eliciting a history without being committed to what the social workers revealingly call disclosure'he suggestedOnce initial interviews with children had been videotapedthe prosecution should have the right to apply for a pre-trial hearing before the judgein informal surroundingsat which the child could be examined and cross-examinedBut there were serious objections to using the videotaped interview as a complete substitute for the child's evidence in chief at the trialbecause of the unsatisfactory nature of the questioning and because it would cause difficulties for the prosecutionFirst Birdwatching Fair in Rutland

the painting in London commercial galleries hovers somewhere between Expressionism and a more traditional British RomanticismA good example is the William Tillyer show at Bernard JacobsonTillyer sees nature as luscious and womb-likeThe way he interprets it owes a lot to the work of the late Ivon Hitchenswho used a similar techniquewith broad swirls and patches of paintand little attention to detailsThe exhibition indicates that Tillyer's work has been moving away from Hitchens and closer to American landscape-abstractionistsnotably Helen FrankenthalerSome of the pictures are American in scale very much bigger than anything he has shown before and this makes the resemblance more apparentPrices from Â£7,000-Â£40,000Kark Weschkeat the Redfern Galleryis Expressionist in a more orthodox

at about Â£200,000 which was raised to give aid and comfort to homecoming British prisoners after the Second World War is alleged to be growing in direct proportion to the number of old soldiers dying without ever seeing a penny of itThe fundraised in 1944 in the Midlandswas invested by officials of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment andapart from the stock market crash of two years agoit has steadily increasedIn one 10-year period from the mid-1970s it rose from just over Â£30,000 to nearly Â£250,000and analysts calculate that in 20 years when all the men it was specifically designed to help will be long dead it will be worth well over Â£1m and increasing in value at more than Â£100,000 a yearYetthe Labour MP Jeff Rooker claimsthere have been examples of Royal Warwickshire prisoners of war seeking desperately needed help who have been given as little as Â£25while many more have been means-tested and found unqualifiedfor even basic financial assistanceThere has also been malpractice in the past by officials administering the fundhe claimsin which thousands of pounds were used to foot the bill for regimental social functionsThis was privately admitted by senior officers who took over the running of the fund two years agoand after an inquiry by the Charity Commission more than Â£3,000 was repaid from regimental fundsMr RookerMP for Perry Barr in Birminghamdiscovered the existence of the POWs Fund in 1976 and publicised it in the MidlandsHe received about 20 letters from ex-regimental POWs who were in needthese were passed on to the regimentMr Rooker said that the 20 letters resulted in only seven men receiving financial helpThe highest-paid got Â£40 and the lowest-paidÂ£25in a payout of Â£220 even though the fund then stood at Â£58,000Of the other 13 POWssix were given nothingfive either died at that time or could not be tracedand two refused to submit to means testingSome of these men had been so badly damagedboth physically and mentallyby their experiences on the battlefield and in POW camps that their lives were ruinedMr Rooker said money from the fund simply never got to the people who needed it because it wasn't publicised enough and because the regimental administrators were inefficientNow it is standing at a huge sumgrowing rapidlyand it is still not going where it is neededHe addedThe sane thing to do would be to take perhaps half of the total summake a determined effort to find every surviving POWand share the money equally with themThe man in charge of the fundBrigadier Jimmy Chateradmitted that there had been problems with finding and helping Royal Warwickshire POWsand agreed that the income from the fund exceeded the benefits paid outHe said that some time ago the POWs fund was merged with a general purposes benefit fund for all old comrades of the regimentbut that POWs were given priority in any benefit payoutsI wish it were true that the fund will continue to growbut we are at the mercy of the marketsand we must keep a healthy capital amount for all needy old soldiers down on their luckIf we were to wind up the POWs fund and pay out the money once and for all to all POWs that we could findwe could run into severe problems in the next 10 to 15 years as these chaps get very old and need help even moreThere were problems in the past with the way the fund was runbut when I took over a couple of years ago we took a very long look at our accounting system and put matters rightNowwe advertise repeatedly for any POWs who are in troubleand we are only too pleased to help themI regret the allegation of means testingWhen we are asked for assistance we call in the Servicessocial services peoplethe SSAFA Soldiers'Sailors' and Airmen's Families Associationwho decide what help is neededand we provide

Robin Ibbs as the Prime Minister's efficiency adviser and part-time head of her efficiency unitIt was a tough assignment for two reasonsFirstSir Robin and his team had developedand persuaded ministers to adoptthe most radical plan the so-called Next Steps for restructuring the Civil Service in nearly 150 yearsNo successor could hope for such an earth-moving tenure as thatSecondlySir Angus was barely a year out of the Civil Service after a career which had taken him to the chairmanship of the Customs and ExciseWouldn't today's permanent secretaries rather resent one of their own returning to tell them how to overturn the habits of a lifetimeTwelve months onSir Angus is not really worried on either scorePreparing the Next Steps the conversion of the Civil Service's businesses into executive agencies standing free of policy-making departments tended to monopolise the attention of the efficiency unit with its tiny staffThe Next Steps is now a separate project run by Peter Kemp in the Cabinet OfficeRenewing the emphasis on the unit's original raison d'etre created by Lord Raynerthe Prime Minister's first efficiency adviser the scrutiny programme of efficiency studies was necessarySir Angus saidas it had taken a bit of a setbackHe is very pleased with the good meaty topicsdepartments have been suggesting for scrutiny this yearHe mentioned the Home Office-led investigation of state funding of the voluntary sectorthe Department of Education's investigation of educational support grantsabout Â£650m worthgiven to local education authorities for tasks deemed especially importantand the Department of Social Security's review of the shortfall of contributions to contributory benefitsamounting to nearly Â£500m a yearAs for old colleagues resenting his intrusion on their territoryAny external agent is going to be viewed with a certain amount of suspicionI haven't noticed itHaving done the job myselfit helps me to understand that departments are being asked to review everything continuouslyIt doesn't mean they get an easier ridebut it does mean I'm not going to be utterly unreasonable in the demands I makeOne thing Margaret Thatcher asked him to concentrate on in his Whitehall travels is the quality of departments' planning machineryThis has been a focus of his first year and will be of his secondOccasionallythe efficiency unit scrutinises itselfSo I asked Sir Angus to answer the basic questions he tells scrutineers to applyEvery scrutineer begins by asking What's it forSir Angus repliedWe are for advising the Prime Ministerwho is very interested in efficiency and effectiveness in the Civil ServiceWe are for bringing outside analysis to departments along with the office of the Minister for the Civil Service and the TreasuryThe Treasury are the regularsWe are the irregularsHow much do you and your staff of eight costÂ£374,000 a yearWho are your customersI am a servant of the Prime MinisterIn another senseit's the departments with whom we workIn another senseit's the consumer or the taxpayerIs the efficiency unit necessaryIt's necessary because the PM wants itThe question is whether the same remit could be fulfilled by different meansWe find that being cast in the role of external stimulator does serve a useful functionIf a department has an internal review it can get bogged down in internal considerationsWe guarantee high-level attention from the permanent secretary and the ministerThe results are less likely to seep into the sandLike everyone else in late 1980s Whitehallthe words changing the cultureare constantly on Sir Angus' lipsThathe saysis what the Next Steps is all aboutIt will succeed only if it changes the way business is done and accounted forIs it going to workYesWhen I left the Civil Service in 1987 I was rather pessimisticBut the way it's moved on has been quite goodI reckon it's pretty well irreversibleSalary increases for managers average 11%By BARRIE CLEMENTLabour EditorPAY

and the City's financial institutions against each otherMillions of pounds are at stake and one side is certain to receive a bloody noseThe legality of money market dealings by Hammersmith and Fulham Council in west Londonwhich once amounted to exposure of Â£5bn is being challenged by its auditorAnthony Hazella partner in Deloitte Haskins and Sellswith the support of the Audit Commissionthe local authority financial watchdogThe council embarked on a series of complex and sophisticated manoeuvresincluding interest rate swapsswap optionsand cash options which initially proved profitable earning Â£13m but which would now result in massive lossesEssentiallythese manoeuvres are a way of managing debt to take advantage of interest rate changesbut the council went way beyond debt management into pure financial speculationThere are 77 other local authorities playing the markets in a similarthough less extensivewayand a similar number of financial institutions are involvedAll these transactions could be declared ultra viresbeyond the legal powers of local authorities and therefore invalidif Hammersmith losesThe judges could complicate matters by ordering that the outcome of the deals be reversednecessitating a mind-numbing series of calculations by the CityButif Hammersmith wins and the deals are declared legalthe council will have to pay the losses on the transactionsThese have mounted because in February Nicholas Ridleythen Secretary of State for the Environmentstopped any new deals and Hammersmith's portfolio was largely weighted to the expectation that interest rates would be lowpreventing the council from improving its position in the marketThe council had wound down its holdings from Â£5bn to Â£2bn but its advisers had backed the wrong horse by predicting low interest ratesIn an affidavit to be presented to the hearingthe auditor calculated that Hammersmith could lose Â£74m at current levels of interest rate and Â£186m if rates rose by 1 per centGiven that this sum represents more than half the council's average annual spendingthe poll tax payers would be faced with a nightmareThe council's fund established after Mr Ridley blocked the deals to pay back any losses is currently less than Â£20mFortunately for Hammersmith and its citizenslegal advisers for all parties concerned have been unequivocalall suggesting a defeat for the councilwhich would mean Hammersmith would not have to pay the losses on the transactionsThe deals stretch back to 1983 when the council was run by a Conservative-Liberal coalitionFor several years the market playing was limited but early in 1988finance officers began taking options out on a massive schemeThe council's Labour leadershipwho have been in control since 1986have argued that they had no control over the transactions as the day to day running of the finance department is in the hands of expert financial staffPublicly the banks have suggested that there could be dire consequences for the City should the deals be ruled illegalThey feel that as innocent parties they are being cheatedHoweverinsiders reckon that the councils will get away with it if Hammersmith losesWhile the banks may then try to sue the council or even individual officers the risk is very widely spread and no financial institution will be put in dangerCity schools face cash cutsBy SIMON MIDGLEYEducation ReporterHARD-PRESSED

weekend to launch a make or breakdrive to roll back the abortion lawsExperts on both sides of the debate believe the parliamentary campaign has the best chance of success since abortion was legalised in 1967Phyllis Bowmannational director of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Childtold its annual conference at Keele that a dual attack on abortion and embryo experimentation will be launched in the autumn when the Government announces its Bill on embryo researchThe societywhich claims wide support in the Commons and the Lordswill campaign against embryo research and aim to introduce its own amendment to reduce the time limit for abortion to 18 weeksThe Government has indicated it will make provision in the Bill for such an amendmentThat means it will be the first time abortion has been debated as part of government legislationrather than on the basis of a private member's BillAs a resultthe amendment cannot be talked outas has happened on every previous occasionbut will have to be resolved through a free voteThe society move was immediately condemned yesterday by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service as an attempt to hijack government legislationDiane Mundayfor

the society's Education Research TrustMrs Winterton said the campaign would be the most complex fought by the sociey because it linked the two issuesSome MPs and peers were in favour of one but not the otherIn additionthe Bill would be introduced in the Lords first and while the society had cloutwith MPspeers were less assailableshe saidNeverthelessits members were all urged to target MPs and peers particularly the wavererswith letters and personalised press releasesissued at the conferenceMrs Winterton said letters should not be sent to the convertedwho might find them an irritantsuggesting a change of tactics since the campaign over the Alton BillThe Government's Bill on embryo research comes after the report of the committee chaired by Baroness Warnock which recommended experiments on foetuses be allowed up to 14 daysThere will be two alternative clauses one calling for a ban on research and one for research to be allowed up to 14 daysThe Bill will also set up a statutory licensing body to police experimentationAs well as campaigning for the first of the two alternativesand for balanced representation on the licensing bodythe society will introduce

attack on Phariseesrevives rift with ToriesBy JAMES DALRYMPLEIN A RASPING attack on the Phariseesof British society who decry the unsuccessfulthe jobless and the poorthe Archbishop of Canterbury has returned to his attack on a decade of Conservative governmentDr Robert Runcie links drug and alcohol abusecrime and vandalismdebt and family break-up with a section of the political and commercial leadership that saysWe have made the people wealthyit's the Church's job to make them goodIn an interview in the magazine Director to be published this weekDr Runcie denies that there are tensions and suspicionsbetween Lambeth Palace and 10 Downing Streetbut he points out that the Church of England is active in parts of the country where the Conservative Party has little supportThis makes the church sensitive to the needs of those areas and that section of the population which has not benefited from the last 10 years of Conservative governmenthe saysclaiming that there is no automatic connection between wealth creation and a happy societyHe also saysJesus reserved his most astringent criticism for the PhariseesWe tend to think that the Pharisees were unscrupulousdouble-dealinguntrustworthyThat was not the caseMost of them led lives of exemplary moral rectitudeThat did not cause them to escape the sharp edge of Jesus's tongueHe disliked their self-righteousness and their judgemental attitudesThose are the real dangers in our society todayI sense they are both increasingThe successful are always tempted to regard their success as a sort of blessing or reward for righteousnessThis can lead to judgements being made about the unsuccessfulthe unemployedthe poor and the unintelligent which are both uncharitable and untrueI'm thinking of the sort of attitude that suggests the unemployed do too little to help themselvesthat if only you have determination and drive you can get on in the worldHe says there are positive factors in the new atmosphere between local authorities and private enterprisebut it hardly touches on the problems of poor housinglack of amenities and the continuing unemploymentThese problems are what lead to that sense of being left outof isolation and despairwhich in turn can lead to the symptoms we are familiar with drug and alcohol abusecrime and vandalismdebt and family break-upA Downing Street spokesman said yesterday that there was absolutely no reaction at allto Dr Runcie's latest broadsideIvor StanbrookMP for Orpingtonwho chairs the Conservative backbench constitutional affairs committee and is an AnglicansaidThe ills of society are as much the responsibility of the Church as of political partiesThe Archbishop should be thoroughly ashamed of himself at the failure of the efforts of the Church to create a better societyDespite their differencesthe philosophies of the two main political parties in Britain can be supported quite sincerely by ChristiansFrank FieldLabour MP for Birkenhead and also an Anglicansaid Dr Runcie was right to attack government polices but he should also direct his attention to the Churchwhich was self-righteousness on stiltsSupport came from one unlikely quarterPeter Bottomleythe Northern Ireland ministerHe said Dr Runcie was being attacked by people who had not read the article in its entiretyWhat he actually says is a very proper reminder that you can do more good with wealth in the nationin the community and in the familybut wealth for its own sake is not a good thingPhariseeOne of an ancient Jewish sect distinguished by their strict

the Albert Hall in central London that if they had only shown the non-Muslim majority that Mr Rushdie had grievously insulted the QueenMargaret Thatcher and all white women in The Satanic Versesthen the author would have been condemned by all of society and the book bannedBut Sheikh Deedatwho is based in South Africaavoided a straight answer when asked if Mr Rushdie should be killedHis talk was

addsClarke's strategy set at secret talksBy COLIN BROWNPolitical CorrespondentHEALTH MINISTERS met secretly at Chevening last week to agree a strategy for winning the propaganda battle over the Government's NHS changesThe first step will come next week when Kenneth ClarkeSecretary of State for Healthuses the Conservative Party conference at Blackpool to reaffirm his commitment to changing the NHS and set out a justification for the forthcoming legislationMr Clarke is also keen to avoid further conflict with GPsAlthough he will take urgent steps to impose a new contractwhich they have rejectedhe has told the doctors' and dentists' pay review body that he is prepared to tackle any problems arising in the first yearOne source saidHe gave an undertaking to the DDRB in his submission last week that we will monitor very closely the effects of the contract in the first yearIf there are any problems in performance-related paywe can iron these outWe are not saying it is fixed in concreteWe are saying it is the best we can do and we must judge how it is operatingMr Clarke's undertaking will be seen as a promise to provide more moneyif it becomes necessaryin an effort to assuage the doctors' concerns about the contractNew pay recommendations are due in the new year andalthough Mr Clarke has told the review body that there must be pay restraintministers appear likely to press for the award to be metThe meeting at Cheveningthe Kent home taken from Sir Geoffrey Howe and handed to his successor as Foreign SecretaryJohn Majorwas also a stock-taking exerciseIt took place after the BMA leadership agreed to call off its damaging campaign against cash restraint on GPs' drug budgetsa move regarded by Mr Clarke as a breakthroughin his efforts to win wider supportThe Government is hoping the BMA's acceptance of assurances that patients will not be denied drugs for cash reasons will also end allegations that doctors will not take the elderly and chronically sick on lists because they are too expensive to treatMinisters say they have deliberately avoided sounding triumphalabout the BMA's backdown to avoid rekindling the controversyThey are keenly aware the BMA leadership could come under attack from its rank and fileThe BMA decision came with perfect timing for Mr Clarkewho was facing serious Conservative unrest at Blackpool about the presentation of health policiesHe will lay an order in the Commons in a fortnightimmediately after the summer recessto impose a new contract on GPsHe aims to have it debated and passed by next monthMinisterial sources confirmed the contract will be the same in every particularas the deal reached with the BMA leadership which was rejected in a ballot by doctorsMinisters say Mr Clarke's decision not to drop the concessions on targets for performance-related paygiven in talks with the BMAand return to the tougher limits for higher pay underlines his determination to seek peaceHoweverit also reflects government recognition that health has become one of its most vulnerable policy areasThe Labour Party ConferencePolicy review throws a spanner in the Whitehall machineryBy COLIN HUGHESPolitical CorrespondentAN INCOMING Labour government would turn large areas of Whitehall upside downbut the party's policy review barely considers the implications of its plans for restructuring government departmentsScattered through the policy review are proposals toDrastically alter the status and organisation of the Department of Trade and IndustryCreate two departments a Department of Consumer Affairsand a Department for Legal AdministrationCreate a Department of Environmental Protection within the existing Department of the EnvironmentSet up a plethora of new commissions and executive agenciesSet up a Women's MinistryThose are only the most overt changes advocated in the review papersThe only department which explicitly escapes unscathed is the one which Conservatives would most like to abolishthe Department of EnergyIn virtually every case the aim of causing upheaval is explicitly declaredbecause Labour's aim would be to upset the bureaucratic order it inheritsNew departments and quangos wouldaccording to the reviewbe designed to act as irritants and antagonists within the Civil Service systemBut the policy review nowhere considers the overall effect of the individual changes proposedor how they might be co-ordinatedNor does it contemplate the knock-on consequences for Labour ministers of attempting to implement their programme while rebuilding the governmental machineThe medium term industrial strategywhich would form the centrepiece of Labour's economic policy wouldaccording to the Productive and Competitive Economy review groupbe administered by a transformed Department of Trade and IndustryThe review addsWhat we now seek is a DTI which will have an equalif not superior statusto that of the TreasuryThat approach would seek to knock out a keystone of Civil Service traditionLabour policy has long sought to challenge the Treasury's dominance in governmentBut its last effort the Department of Economic Affairsset up by Harold Wilson and headed by George Brown ended in futile departmental and ministerial infightingThere would in addition be a minister for Science and Technology at the newly supreme DTIwith responsibility for determing investment in researchThere is no mention in the education policy of how that might affect the Department of Education and ScienceBut while the DTI would override the Treasurya new powerful Department of Consumer Affairswould antagonise the DTIIt would be headed by a minister of Cabinet rankand act as the consumersvoice with other government departments'Its remit for inter-departmental intrusion would be widewith a watching brief over government actionand the ability to initiate consumer legislationOnly the Women's Ministry would be given equal licenseIt would be able to require each government department to review its policiespracticesand existing and proposed legislationWhile new departments are born and others extendedone of the oldest the Home Office would become a shadow of its present selfLabour's proposed Department for Legal Administration would take over responsibility for courts and tribunalscourt proceduresorganisationtraining and appointment of the legal professionmagistracy and judiciarylegal aidlegal servicesand the Sentencing CouncilThat would leave the Home Office with policingpenal policy and the criminal lawResponsibility for the Sex Discrimination Actthe Equal Pay Act and the Equal Opportunities Commission would be given to the Women's MinistryThe concept of a minister having Cabinet rank and therefore implicitly not being a member of the Cabinet proper crops up again on environmentA new Minister of Environmental Protectionwould operate inside the DoEThat could work though it is easy to imagine conflicts of interest with the housing and planning functions of the departmentMore problematic will be Labour's plan for the Ministry of AgricultureFisheries and FoodThe priority of MAFF must become foodnot farmingthe policy review saysIts main concerns would become food and the people who consume itnot farming and those who produce itBut the regulatory functions over the food industrynow split between MAFF and the Department of Healthwould transfer to a new Food Standards AgencyThat is the first of many agenciesexecutivescommissionsand other quango-like bodies recommended by the reviewIn some cases Labour's quangos merge existing onesor replace well-established bodiesThe funding of higher education would become the responsibility of one bodyrather than twoLabour's Quality Commission would replace the Audit CommissionBut there would be new regulatory commissions and consumer councils for every utilityalong with ombudsmenand public interest commissioners appointed by the Secretary of StateThere would be Skills UK a locally structured training commission a Fair Wages Commissiona Health Technology Commissiona Health Quality Commissionan Education Standards Councilan Independent Sentencing Councila Children's Commissioneran Environmental Protection Executiveand a Social Insurance Fund administered byan independent commissionThe Labour Party ConferenceCook appeals for Labour to accept electoral reformBy COLIN HUGHES and COLIN BROWNAN IMPASSIONED appeal for Labour to back electoral reform was made by a leading Shadow Cabinet member yesterday after the national executive decided overwhelmingly to oppose a proportional representation motionRobin Cooka member of the national executive and the health spokesmansaid that a Labour government which sought to force its programme on an unwilling nation would be unsocialistHe told a Labour Co-ordinating Committee rally that it was not enough for Labour to win the next electionIt would also be necessary to smash the decrepiteffete constitution that allows a minority to capture powerand then use it ruthlessly in the interests of the privileged fewMr Cook argued that 10 years of Thatcherism had been forced on most peoplewho had never voted Conservativeand that many of those who opposed PR in the Labour Party wanted to use the same undemocratic power to ram socialism down the throats of a majority who didn't vote for itAdvocates of the first-past-the-post system argued that it was the only way of delivering strong governmentMr Cook saidBut after 10 years of Tory rulehe had had enough of that approach to politicsLabour would be acquiescing in a democratic outrageif it continued arguing thatbecause the Conservatives had got away with being undemocratic for so longit was now Labour's turnMr Cook also countered the argument that PR would build in a pull towards the centre groundpreventing Labour from implementing a radical programmeIt seemed strange to make that argumentMr Cook saidwhen it was clear the whole policy review process was designed to placate the centre groundI cannot honestly see that a system which would require us to compromise the morning after the election is really so morally inferior to a system which has already obliged us to compromise our policies two years before polling dayHis speechhowevercame aftera 24-4 vote in the national executive to oppose a proportional representation motion which will be debated on ThursdayThe four were Mr CookKen LivingstoneJohn Evans and Clare ShortMr Livingstone said he was against pactsbut 10 years of Thatcherism had demonstrated the dangers of giving power to elitesHoweverNeil Kinnockthe Labour leaderand Roy Hattersleyhis deputyboth opposed the motionMr Hattersley said giving disproportionate power to smallminority centre parties would not improve democracyMr Kinnock said it was wrong to propose a fundamental change in the voting system for a short-term tactical vote to get rid of the Thatcher GovernmentThe only way to remove the Government was for Labour to win the next general electionMr Kinnock intends to reinforce his conviction that Labour is in a position to win in his keynote speech tomorrowParty organisers want the conference to show that the party is united as never beforeleaving Mr Kinnock free for the first time to sell the policy package to voters without worrying about splitsThere is expected to be a close vote on defencebut Mr Kinnock is confident the new policy will be affirmed todayThe executive is recommending rejection of a motion calling for unilateral disarmamentIt is also urging the conference to oppose a motionsupported by the National Union of Mineworkersto commit a Labour government to abolishing all nuclear power within 15 yearsThere could also be controversy over the executive's rejection of demands for the age of consent for homosexuals to be reduced to 16 yearsThe Labour Party ConferenceScargill may stand for Barnsley seatBy COLIN HUGHES and COLIN BROWNARTHUR SCARGILLthe miners' presidentrefused yesterday to deny reports that he was to become a Labour MPMr Scargill is said by sources in the National Union of Mineworkers to be putting his name forward for the Barnsley West and Penistone constituencyThe NUM leader vice-chairman of the constituency party said any such decision would have to be taken by the Yorkshire area of the NUMMr Scargill would seek to become an NUM-sponsored MPThe present Labour MP in Barnsley WestAllen McKayis to retire before the next general electionMr McKay had a majority of 14,191 at the 1987 electionMr Scargill's election to Parliament would acutely embarrass Mr Kinnockbut would pave the way for the NUM's merger with the Transport and General Workers' UnionTGWU members have said they would resist attempts to make Mr Scargill leader of a new energy section within their unionIt is also possible that party members in Barnsley would prefer a more moderate candidateThe Labour Party ConferenceRough-edged voice of the grass rootsBy COLIN HUGHESJOHN PRESCOTT did not go to universitywas never a television presenterand finds it exceedingly difficult to complete a grammatically correct sentenceThose are three reasons why he will today be elected to Labour's national executivewrites Colin HughesThe other main reason is thathaving been sidelined by Neil Kinnock last year into the job of transportMr Prescott has found himself appearing on the early-evening television and radio bulletins more often than any other member of the Shadow CabinetHis brief has converted him into Labour's chaos and disaster spokesmanFrom clogged skies to choked motorwaysfrom Clapham Junction to the MarchionessMr Prescott has been Labour's voice of protest on an issue that has moved to the heart of the quality of lifeagenda increasingly dominating the political agendaThe former ferry stewardwho rose through the National Union of Seaman before being elected MP for Hullwears every thought and feeling on his sleeveHe is therefore easily riled or mockedNicholas Soamesthe aristocratically toned and booming Tory MP for Crawleycan still make him stumble at the despatch box by muttering Another G and TGiovanniThough he is neither intellectually sharp nor verbally articulateMr Prescott is intelligent in a self-schooled wayand speaks in a language that many Labour voters understandThe smooth style of Bryan Gould and the calm air of managerial competence conveyed by John Smith are deemed essential to make southern voters feel confident about the new Labour PartyMr Prescott's rough-edged style conveys a sense of honest indignationwhere soothing strokes of eloquence might seem insincereOn top of thathe enjoys an unusually untainted popularity among activists and grass-roots trade unionistsHaving devoted most of his political life to touring constituencies and union brancheshe has barely needed to campaign for the constituency section of the executive over the past two monthsWhen Mr Prescott first backed off standing against Roy Hattersley for the deputy leadership last yearand then changed his mind and decided to contest it after allNeil Kinnock expressed unrestrained irritationBut the pairopenly hostile by the end of last yearwill patch up their mutual differencesMr Kinnock will want Mr Prescott's national executive support and may sometimes even need his constructive criticismMr Prescott is unquestionably closer to a large swathe of the rank and file than most other members of Labour's Shadow CabinetMaybe it was for that reason that the party leader singled Mr Prescott's past year performance out for praise in an interview in The Sunday Correspondent yesterdaycalling himchummilyJohnnyAll the signsit seemsof an overnight rehabilitationThe Labour Party ConferenceConference condemned by activists as farceBy STEPHEN GOODWINAN ATTEMPT by party activists to empower the Labour conference to amend the leadership's policy review was defeated

the final word on policy determinationonly one backed the procedure adopted by the leadership for the reviewTrade union delegates remained silent during the short debate but voted solidly behind the

procedures and policy-making on FridayThe Labour Party ConferenceCompromise over black sections set for defeatBy BARRIE CLEMENTLabour EditorNEIL KINNOCK'S attempt to defuse the long-standing

Transport and General Workers' Unionwhich has the largest block vote 1.3mis abstainingThe GMB general union and the Amalgamated Engineering Unionwith 800,000 and 600,000 votes respectivelyare casting theirs againstThe decisions of the union delegations will probably mean a continuing wrangleA hardline motion calling for black sections is almost certain to be thrown out on Friday and the party could be left without a policy as support for a proposition calling for societies with exclusively black members is also in doubtMr Kinnock's compromise would have created one societywith a national executive seat if it attracted more then 3,000 membersThe NEC adopted the plan by 21 votes to fiveBill Morrisdeputy general secretary of the TGWU and the most influential black trade unionistbelieves society membership should be restricted to representatives of ethnic minoritiesMr Kinnock and his deputyRoy Hattersleyhave consistently opposed exclusively black sectionsThe party's campaign to win

attacked the main elements of the packagefrom its abandonment of nuclear unilateralism to the shift away from all out renationalisationMr Benn told the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy rallyNow we

as there are millionaires living in the lap of luxury and other people living in cardboard boxesso long as we have a system which allows the poor countries of the world to hand over $50m to the richHe maintained there was only one way to resolve differences within the party leadership over Labour's policy towards a privatised water industryTake water back without compensationHoweverMr Skinner
