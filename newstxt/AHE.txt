Judges order appeal into explosives caseBy Terence ShawLegal CorrespondentJOHN BERRY54who was released on parole last week after serving three and a half years of a six-year sentence for making explosive devicesis to have a new appeal hearing in his long-running legal battle to clear his nameThree Court of Appeal judges headed by Lord Lanethe Lord Chief Justiceruled yesterday that the court could entertain a request by Mr BakerHome Secretaryfor the case to be revieweddespite its 1990 ruling that Berrya Norfolk businessman and ex-Royal Marinecould not have his case reopenedLord Lane said another division of the court had then felt powerless to intervene and hear new grounds of appeal because the Lords restored Berry's conviction after an earlier successful appealThe difficulties in the case were caused by the Court of Appeal's earlier failure to rule on two of Berry's three grounds of appealsaid Lord Lanebut that did not preclude the Home Secretary from re-opening the caseBerryfrom BramertonNorfolkwas originally convicted at Chelmsford Crown Court in 1983 of making electronic timers for detonating bombsHe had been tried jointly with another businessmanJeffrey Smithwho was eventually cleared at a retrialBerry's conviction was quashed on a legal technicality by the Court of Appeal in early 1984but later that year the House of Lords restored the conviction in allowing an appeal by the CrownHe fled to Spain while on bail awaiting the House of Lords ruling but was returned to England in 1989 and resumed his sentenceTemple of the law is turning into a casinoTHE JASON DONOVAN LIBEL CASEDamages award reinforces the need for reformsay lawyersBy Terence ShawLegal CorrespondentTHE £200,000 damages awarded to Jason Donovan will be seen by many lawyers as another illustration of the urgent need for libel law reformThe award was made despite one of the strongest warnings ever by a judge to a libel jury about excessive pay-outsIt will lead to renewed demands that the judge should fix the amount of damages if a jury has decided that defamation has been proved or at least be given power to lay down minimum and maximum limits for juriesSince the Court of Appeal judgment in the Sonia Sutcliffe casewhen damages of £600,000 awarded to the wife of the Yorkshire Ripper against Private Eye were reduced by consent to £60,000judges have been encouraged to give general guidance to juriesMr Justice Drake used this power to full in summing up in the Donovan casewarning the jurors that they should not think they had to fix sums with lots of noughts on the end because it's fashionableHe urged them to compare any sum they had in mind with damages that might be awarded for physical injuries that lasted a lifetimeBut he was not able to give any more specific guidance to the jury on how they should seek to compare the harm suffered by Donovan as a result of the libel with that suffered by those claiming damages in personal injury casesIn his libel action seeking aggravated damagesDonovan claimed he suffered serious injury to his professional and personal reputationconsiderable distress and embarrassment and that the article implied he was guilty of gross hypocrisy and deceit by denying that he was homosexualDonovan told the jury that he was not and never had been a homosexualHis counselMr Charles GrayQCsuggested that the libel had damaged his reputation at a time when he was about to break into serious acting after a string of top 10 hits as a pop star and a stint in the Australian TV soapNeighboursThere is an accepted tariff of damages for personal injuries laid down on a case-to-case basis by judgesBut damages awarded by juries in libel cases for injury to reputation are at largeand only subject to the general guidance by judges and limited powers for the Court of Appeal to correct those that are excessiveOne libel expertMr Geoffrey RobertsonQCauthor of the leading textbook on Media Lawsaid after yesterday's verdict that huge awards were turning the temple of the law into a casinoBritain did not have free speech because of the libel lawshe saidIt has expensive speechMost western democracies have laws which offer a better balance between freedom of expression and the right to reputationA new media law package was needed to guarantee freedom of expression and information and to liberalise the libel and contempt lawsbalanced by a law to protect unjustifiable invasion of privacyThe key reform would be the introduction of a Bill of Rights with a free speech guarantee of the sort enjoyed by America and most European countriesThe libel laws should be changed to provide a fast tracksystem allowing victims of media falsehoods to correct them quickly without having to wait a long time for their cases to go to court and gamble on the resultThe only cases where heavy damages should be awarded are where the words have been published out of malicesaid Mr RobertsonLuxury life awaits private jail inmatesBy
