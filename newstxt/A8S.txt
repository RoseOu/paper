A dragon without fire Michael Billington misses the menace in the RSC's revival of Shakespeare's best political playIT is twelve years since the last Stratford Coriolanusan absurd neglect of Shakespeare's best political playBut the new production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatredirected by Terry Hands and John Bartonhas a lot going for itPaceClarityThe best Volumnia in years from Barbara JeffordButin an ideal worldone would look for more dangerous animalism than one gets from Charles Dance's Coriolanus in order to sharpen the edge of political debateWhat makes this such a great play is Shakespeare's analytical poweras John Barton once pointed outShakespeare is neither right-wing nor left-wing but wing-lessCoriolanus is seen as a magnificent warriora psychologically damaged mother-worshipper and a potential threat to an evolving republicThe peopleon the other handare suffering from famine at a time when the patricians are hoarding the grain-harvest but are themselves easily manipulated by the TribunesShakespeare does not so much take sides as show how the state is threatened by the tragic collision of opposing forcesfor antique Rome read Jacobean EnglandWhat is good about the current production is that it does not seek to tilt the play either wayit allows us to decide where we standIt also impliesrather than re-createsthe pastChristopher Morley's set consists of three mobile siege-towers with the Romansin costume termsveering to black leatherthe Volscians to scarlet greatcoatsAnd along the way the production makes a number of intelligent pointsThe Tribunes are strongly contrastedwith Geoffrey Freshwater's bullish rabble-rouser of a Sicinius Velutus offset by the ineffectual moderation of Joe Melia's Junius BrutusThe continuity of martial values is also brilliantly suggested at the end when Coriolanus's son ritually receives his father's sword from Volumnia while his mother looks grievingly onWhat I misshoweverin Charles Dance's Coriolanus is a sense of implacable dangerMr Dance gives us many of the man's essential qualitieshis psychological dependence on his motherhis solitariness he is constantly placed down front gazing over the audience's headshis antiquetribal valourBut there is a dragonish aspect to Coriolanus which Mr Dance has yet to catchHe also throws away too many key phrasesThis Triton of the minnowsis a magnificent epithet for Sicinius but it here gets lost and although in the great banishment-speech Mr Dance's body-language is good as he hurls his coat to the ground in fine disdainit is significant that the directors resort to an echo-chamber effect on There is a world elsewhereOlivierone wanly recallshad his own built-in reverberationsWithout a dictatorial CoriolanusShakespeare's point about the implied threat to the republic is stated rather than feltBut there is rich compensation in Barbara Jefford's magnificent Volumniawhy has this superb actress been given only two roles by the RSC in 30 yearsShe isessentiallya voluptuous Volumnia whose hold over her son is dangerously sexualGreeting him on his return from battleshe hands him over to his wife with palpable reluctanceseeking to calm him before his confrontation with the peopleshe shackles him in an iron gripandin the great plea with him not to sack Romeshe pinpoints the lines about him treading on his mother's womb that brought thee to this worldVolumnia can easily be played as a sexless harridanMs Jefford interprets her as a passionate woman who dominates her son physically as well as spirituallyeven to the extent of giving his face a resounding slap when he is recalcitrantBut the other key roles are also strongly castMalcolm Storry's bullet-headed Aufidius is not simply a rude barbarian but an acute analyst of Coriolanus's characterMr Storry has the priceless gift of making the language tangible so that when he says I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fishthe image comes resonantly aliveJoseph O'Conor also makes Menenius infinitely more than a wily patricianhe seems the only one capable of communicating sanely with the severalwarring factionsIn what is normally seen as a male-dominated playit is also worth noting that Hands and Barton give the women unusual prominenceAmanda Harris's Virgilia is no simpering wet but a loyal wife who vehemently thumps the tribunes for their banishment of her husbandAnd Jane Maud's Valeria is characterised in the programme as priestess of Dianaandin the final peace-missionis given unusual symbolic weightThat is a sign of how the play has been intelligently re-thoughtThe production also takes on board the point Anne Barton makes in the programme that Shakespearefollowing Livysees Coriolanus as a threat to the balance of the stateBut for the idea to be made manifest one needs a Coriolanus who is not only a truculent fighter but also a thrillingly horrific force of natureCharles Dance as Coriolanusa threat to the republicPHOTOGRAPHDOUGLAS JEFFERYReady for a huge family row TelevisionBy Hugh HebertGIRDING up for six hours with the Mahabharata is a long trainingAt the weekend we had Peter Brook's approach via the South Bank Show LWTand through the foothills of Lear and the Marat/Sade to this Everest of an Indian epicLast nightthere he was again between the sections of The Greatest Story SignalsC4a kind of Michelin guide to the Hindu poem generally said to be 15 times as long as the Biblea fact I am not inclined to checkTo cut a long legend shortit's about the bloody rivalry between two branches of a Hindu royal family the five Pandava brotherswho all marry the same princessand the 100 Kaurava brothersBoth sides know that eventually it will come to a fightMeanwhilethe leading Pandava brother is enticed into a dice game he knows he will lose but cannot resistUnable to quiet the gambling feverhe loses his kingdomhis familytheir shared wifeand himselfThe Pandavas are banished to the forest for 12 yearsbut eventually the great war comesThe South Bank Show was a help in understanding how and why Brook has spent 15 years bringing this great poem to the stage and now the screenIt's the culmination of his development in the theatre since the mid-Sixties brought his unforgettable Lear with Paul Scofieldhis Theatre of Cruelty seasonand the sledgehammeroperatic impact of his Marat/SadeIt also isolated how he has approached the tricky transfer to the screenTheatre is the art of suggestion and not of statementthe cinema has to produce complete imagesThat is the key problemBut it was Signals that offered just what we need before settling down on Saturday night with soft cushions and iron rationsa clear summaryand the chance to fix on the central characters in this huge dramatic tapestryBrook talked about that central game of dice that Yudishthira playsan ordinaryeveryday actionit also has overtonesthrough the poetic to the metaphysical and the supernaturaland this is just as in ShakespeareIt's as
