Government's education policy has come under attack from the headmaster of a leading North Wales public school who appealed to the public to put more trust in teachersSpeaking at the annual speech dayNigel Thorneheadmaster of Rydal school in Colwynsaid he was increasingly concerned at what was happening to the education system which was faced with a testing monolithAlthough he welcomed many of the central themes in the Government White PaperChoice and Diversityhe had reservations about the way the status of teachers was being underminedThe Government said parents knew best but that failed to recognise the professionalism of teachers and the close links between teachersparents and schoolsA Government White Paper which proclaims that teachers know less about education than parents can scarcely hope to win the support of the teaching professionBut one of his biggest concerns was that the changes being inflictedupon schools would significantly reduce the amount of enjoyment and fun in teachingHer addedThe strong commitment to the whole idea of teaching is being undermined by more and more paperand more and more stressI want my colleagues to continue to enthuse about the job and teach effectivelyI do not want them buried under mounds of paperThe amount of power ministers had seized for themselves over the development of young people was also worryingThe school's decision not to become involved in testing had been proved rightThe tests were poor discriminators andin terms of checking on their progress and diagnosing their weaknesseswe could do a far better job ourselves in a fraction of the timehe declaredHe was worried that the teaching process could become dominated by tests and examsBarrage shelved as cash runs outBy Malcolm Handley Regional Affairs

less stood still this yearYet on Wall Street shares are up by 7pcJapanese shares have gone up 19pc and in Europe the share index has risen by 9pcThe truth is that the Footsie is proving to be a misleading guide to what is really happening in the marketBeneath the surface of the index there is much turmoilwith some shares zooming aheadFor example British Aerospace has more than doubled to 375p this yearThere has also been a huge recovery of confidence in construction material shares as RMC and Redlandalthough my favourite remains Blue Circle at 250p because of its involvement in the home improvement business through Armitage ShanksFearsOn the other hand what is holding the Index back is the drug companiesThese now comprise 10pc of the total index but are under a cloud because of fears about US President's wife Hillary Clintonwho is expected to stamp on their profits hard when her review of the US health scene comes out later this yearSo Glaxo shares are down from £8 to under £6 and Wellcome down from £10 to £7.50Other drug shares have also fallenso the Footsie Index is giving a misleading impression as to the underlying strength of the marketOne share that comes out of this situation well is born-again' ICI at 690pNot only has it hived-off its drug side into Zeneca but alsounlike most chemical companiesit is coming out of the recession with no cash worries as the

Government's English reading and writing test for 14-year-olds in tattersAnd teachers were poised to resume their attack with a boycott of today's English literature and essay papersAlmost all schools

of special treatment at Pentonville PrisonHis sentence is for a civil matterso he is entitled to certain privileges denied to inmates convicted of criminal offencesBut he will still probably spend 15 hours a day or more banged upin his cell in the 150-year-old Victorian jailHis first taste of his new regime came yesterday morning at receptionwhen his warrant was checked and his clothes and possessions logged and storedAfter a short showerhe was given a fresh set of prison clothes and marched off to his cellHis first two days are likely to be spent on the induction wing while he is assessed by prison staffbefore being allocated a permanent cellThe prison population at Pentonville has been cut sharply in recent yearsfrom more than 1,000 to about 600and most inmates now have their own cellsBecause the 37-year-old peer is a civil prisonerthere is also a good chance he will be allocated to the jail's C wingwhere the cells have their own lavatories and wash basinssaving him the indignity of slopping outHis civil status also means he can choose whether or not he wants to work during his sentenceThe jobs on offer cleaninggardeninghelping in the kitchen or the tailoring workshop seem unlikely to appeal to his aristocratic tastesThe alternativehoweveris to spend most of his time in his cellThe Marquess's treatment at the hands of his fellow inmates will depend very much on his own attitudeHe is coming in here as a well-known figureThere's no way they're not going to have heard of him so it all depends on how he reacts to the other prisonersone prison source

problemsThe actionhoweverhas met with the disapproval of Wirral planning authoritywhich views the wire as visually intrusive in the park environmentThe clubhouse is prominently placed close to the park boundary and nearby homesPlanners have condemned the wire as unsympathetic and aliento the design of the buildingMr Costain explainedWe have told the council this is only a temporary measure until we get an extension built at the club and strengthen the roofingWe are asking for a temporary reprieveThe club's original wooden pavilion was burned down in 1977Said Mr CostainWe would have liked to build a replacement with a wooden verandah and stepsbut it can't be done in this day and ageso we had to build a concrete one like Fort KnoxThree break-ins in five months forced club

cash crisis caused by the £650,000 cost of investigating the Warrington bombings seems to have been resolvedCheshire's Chief ConstableDavid Grahamhad warned that manpower would be reduced and cuts made in police station opening hours if the money was not foundThe results could have been disastrous for the force which has already had to freeze recruitment of officers during 1993 to keep within a tight budgetBut at a meeting of Cheshire's Police Committee yesterdaycouncillors made a unanimous decision to find half of the money out of the county council's reservesThe decision still has to be ratified by the Finance and Management Services CommitteeIt is expected that the Home Office will come up with the rest of the moneyThe investigations into the two IRA attacks on February 26 and March 20 involved the setting up of two major incident rooms within Warrington Police Station as well as the setting up of a special HQ for CID costing £35,000Councillors may visit the Home Secretary later in the year to ask him to consider funding a greater proportion of the cost of the investigationsbut chairman of the Police CommitteeJohn Collinswarned they were unlikely to receive more than half of the sumThe £665,000 is not a sum that I believe would gain a positive response from the Government in respect of national assistanceBut we would not want to miss an opportunity or to court a refusalhe saidThe decision whether to ask for more money from the Home Office will be made by a special panel who meet on June 25 to discuss the issueas well as deciding how to fund new security cameras for

no question of closing fire stationsBut the service had looked at 18 areas and applied a Home Office computer to determine which fire station turns out first to a fireVariable travel times were calculatedincluding the time it could take for part-timers to get to their stationMr Hayton last year voiced concern that some part-time stations occasionally failed to get any responseparticularly in the day time and the nearest full-time station had to coverBecause it is calculated that a retained crew might take four minutes to get to the station the computer calculated other stations could respond quickerBuckley fire station has a proud record of getting to all firesComputer models are wonderful things but they do not put people on the groundsaid an angry Coun MesshamThe proposal would

economic and recreational benefitDrawn up by Dyfed County Councilwith help from the district councilsthe guidelines recognise the rapid growth of golfCounty planning officer Dave BownsaidAt the present timeDyfed is witnessing a considerable increase in the number of golf development proposalsThe guidelines make it clear it is council policy not to permit golf development if it involves new buildings or associated development in the open countrysideand is unrelated to existing settlementsGolf developments likely to adversely affect the landscape will be resistedThere will also be opposition to the use of high quality agricultural land for golf coursesSubject to certain conditionsparticular encouragement will be given to proposals where development utilises degraded landand where the development would result in demonstrable improvements to amenitylandscapenature conservation or public accessGolf development will not normally be permitted if it causes unacceptable disruption to the public enjoyment of rights of wayFor many of us the natural beauty of much of Dyfed's countryside remains undisputedthough few people nowadays accept that this will always be

Daily Post CorrespondentTHE families and lawyer of three men convicted of killing newsboy Carl Bridgewater yesterday handed in new evidenceto Home Secretary Michael Howard which they said proved their innocenceThey presented him with a thick dossier containing new information about the alleged confession that led to the convictionsMichael Hickeyhis cousin Vincent Hickey and James Robinson were jailed in 1979 for the murder of 13-year-old Carl as he disturbed their burglary at a remote farmhouse in StourbridgeWest Midlands in September1978Patrick Molloy was convicted of manslaughter and died in prison in 1981Michael Hickey's motherAnn Whelanwho was among a large crowd of protesters outside the Home OfficesaidOur message is simple that we are not going anywhereWe are not going awayThey may as well give us justice now and exonerate these men from this horrific crimeSolicitor Jim Nichol said the main new evidencenever considered beforewas that the confession by Molloy at the centre of the case was not a word-for-word record of what he said but the recollections of police officers presentHe added that a prime suspect in the investigationwho had told police that he had no gun at the time of the murderis now known to have possessed a double-barrelled shotgun at the timeAnd he said there was now further evidence to discredit a principal witness in the case as a liar and a cheatRelatives

at the Home Office yesterdayMarried couples pension rights will have to be faced in futureWE have just about got used to the framework for personal and company pensions introduced in 1986with its incentives for contracting outof the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme SERPSand the freedom to transfer pension rights from company schemes to personal pensionsBut now even bigger and more drastic changes are on the horizonOne stems directly from Europethanks to a European Court JudgementBritain is required to equalise pension rights between men and womenthe other concerns division of pension rights between husband and wifeThe Government has delayed responding to the need to equalise pension rights because it means equalising State retirement agesAt present these are 65 for men and 60 for womenEqualising at 60 is far too expensive for the Government to contemplateBut equalising at 65 would be very unpopular with women CompromiseSooner or later and if not soonerfurther references to the European Court are likely a definite decision will have to be madeRetirement at 63 is the obvious compromise solutionBut since the private sector will then bring its normal retirement ages into linethis will involve complex adjustment of pension rights for everyone in workPotentially an even bigger bombshell is about to burst on the vexed question of pension rightsIt has long been recognised that women who devote years of their lives to bringing up children lose out in the pension stakesTheir husbands earn pension rights while they do notIf divorce followsthe husband keeps the pension rights and the wife has noneAt presentEnglish law does not recognise pension rights as an asset in the context of divorce settlementsAnd even Scottish lawwhere pension rights are taken into account on divorcehas no mechanism for transferring them from one person to anotherAll the judges can do is award a greater proportion of non pension assets to the wife to make up for her lack of long term security and if these other assets are smallthe husband is still the winnerNow a report from the Pensions Management Institute has suggested ways of changing the law to bring pension rights into playThe aim would be to give the courts the right to divide pension rightseven if earned by one of the divorcing partiesbetween themThis would be done on the basis of the factsin particular the period of time the marriage had lasted and the extent to which the wife had foregone the opportunity to earn pension rights while bringing up the childrenThe legislation would not affect the flat-rate State pensionNorat presentdoes it look as though it will be practicable to bring SERPS within the scope of the CourtsBut all other pension rightswhether through occupational or personal pension schemeswould in principle be divisibleProtecting the position of women who work hard at being mothers is obviously a worthy social objectiveand with no political dispute likelythe report's changes could be legislated within a year or twoImplicationsThe implications for the future any changes will almost certainly not apply to pension rights earned before the date off legislationare enormousMarried people will have to treat the pension rights they earn as partly conditional on their remaining marriedAnd the possibilityparticularly for husbandsof losing a significant part of their pension rights on divorce will focus their minds on the value of those rightsAnglican-Catholic plan for new primary schoolEstate's joint venture excitingBy Malcolm Handley Regional Affairs CorrespondentA UNIQUE
