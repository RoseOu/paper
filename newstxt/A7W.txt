22COMMENT THE GUARDIANWednesday November 8 1989 More than just another disasterTHIRTY FIVE people died and others were maimed for life in the Clapham rail disaster in December last year because work was done in a slovenlyhaphazard way and was then left uncheckedThe disaster was all the more stunning because people had come to assume that such things didn't happenIn most yearsrail deaths are fewin some there are none at allClaphamindeedaccounts for nearly half the 77 fatalities of the last ten yearscompare that with the 5,000 deaths and 300,000 injuries every year on the roadsYet yesterday's report on the Clapham crashconfirming the picture which emerged throughout the Hidden inquirymakes an event which seemed at the time totally unexpected look almost inevitableThis was a system hopelessly under strainUnder strain for a start because it was technically ill-equipped to avert disaster or to cope with the consequences when disaster struckunder strain from commercial pressures whichas the inquiry puts itcompromisedsafetyunder strain above all because the people on the spot couldn't or wouldn't copewere weary from gruesome working hours the senior signal technician who heads the list of the culpable had had only one day off in the past 13 weekslacked adequate trainingor simply couldn't be botheredThe bulk of the blame for all that is placed on British Railwhich knowingly permitted these things to continueThough individuals are nailedthe greatest villain of all is the systemIn a desperately competitive climatewhere anyone bright and competent could go down the road and pick up a better paid job with kinder hours and more congenial working conditions from someone like British Telecomthe railways ran a service dependent on people who belonged to a narrow and inbred working culturewith outdated procedures of training and promotionand an institutional reliance on overtime workingwhose wholly disgraceful dimensions are symbolised by the fact that maximum weekly hours were only recently cut to 72 hours a weekThe Transport SecretaryMr Cecil Parkinsonassured the Commons yesterday that financial considerations would not stand in the way of implementing Sir Anthony Hidden's 93 recommendationsOn the technical sideremedial work is in many cases already on the wayBut the job of lifting the standards of people employedgiving them proper trainingand paying a wage which breaks dependence on overtime and lifts moralethis together must far exceed the costs of the technologyand it isn't by any means clear what the bill will be or where the money will come fromAll of which is not just a problem for a properly penitent British Railit's a problem for government tooGovernment fixes the format in which BR has to workand ifas the Hidden report attestsmany of its problems today reflect lack of past planninglack of farsighted investmentliving from hand to mouththen that is not just BR's doingGovernment compounds all these problems when it sets down working parameters which fail to reflect the value the country gets from a system that is run efficientlycan shift people to destinations with exemplary speed and safety as Europe consistently demonstratesIt is sadand somewhat ominousthat so little of that should have been reflected in the sombre statement which Mr Parkinson made in the House yesterdayA service in chaosTHE nation's ambulance service was in manifest chaos yesterdayThere was no service in Londonwith all 71 stations and 455 vehicles off the roadThe only accident and emergency relief was provided by the policepart-time St John ambulance volunteers running 20 vehiclesand the Red CrossOutside the capitalaccident and emergency services were being provided in most areasbut the ban on emergency work was tightenedThe service was facing its biggest crisis since the ambulances came to a stop in the Winter of Discontent ten years agoLike Labour in 1979the Conservatives have put military ambulances on standbyThey move in todayWhat has gone wrongThere are three key causes of the shamblesMr Kenneth Clarkethe failure to separate emergency from non-emergency workand the Whitley Council negotiating machineryThe Health Secretary accused the unions of posturing and pretendingto run a 999 service yesterdayHe was rightBy refusing to keep open two-way radio linksthe crews had effectively ended a proper emergency serviceThe move was signalled last week andtrue to their promised responsemanagement suspended the workers involved in the disruptionBut posturing and pretendingwent far beyond the unionsMr Clarke has been indulging in just that himselfputting up the luckless Duncan Nicholchief executive of the health serviceto take the initial flak under the pretence that the dispute is not his direct responsibilityYet it was Mr Clarkenot Mr Nicholwho was involved in the critical decisions the cash limit for the NHSthe 6.5 per cent offer to ambulance workers compared to seven per cent for nurseseight per cent for doctors and nine per cent for ancillary workersand today's introduction of military ambulancesAmbulance workers on emergency work do deserve a much higher increaseThey have progressed far beyond routine first aidTheir paramedical skills cover highly technical proceduresintubationinfusion and defebrillationThe crews are able to resuscitate heart attack patientsreplace fluid intraveneously after severe blood lossand insert tubes to maintain air supplies in unconconscious casualtiesYet the ambulance worker is only being offered £10,000when a fire officer is being given £13,000 and a Metropolitan police constable can earn £25,000But only two million out of the 20 million journeys which ambulance crews carry out each year are emergency callsNine out of 10 are routine callsmany of which could be carried out by mini cabsMr Duncan Nichol wants to separate the emergency from the non-emergency workHe is right to pursue this lineWiltshire and Northumbria have already shown how much can be achievedThe ramshackle Whitley Council negotiating machinery is the other reason why the ambulance workers have lost outUntil this yearthe three independent review bodies which make recommendations for nursesdoctors and the professions allied to medicine have given much higher awards than the Whitley CouncilsAs Lord McCarthy noted some 13 years agothe management side of the councils comprise employers who do not pay and paymasters who do not employA much more flexible system which would allow local managers to negotiate local rates on a national pay spine is neededA crisisan agenda for reform and honestyOne Mr Clarke cannot duck away from if he wants to avoid a second Winter of DiscontentOpeningclosingPRINCE CHARLES is jolly good at opening thingsHe needs to be for the next four days in Hong Kongbecause he will be hard at work cutting ribbons and laying foundation stonesThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technologythe Hong Kong Island Divisional Headquarters of the Red Crossthe new Cultural Centreand many moreHe is even re-opening the already opened Eastern Harbour tunnel and subway crossingIt is all standard royal stuffbut not much help to the millions who fear that Hong Kong will not remain open after 1997The whole point of a visit to Hong Kong nowfive months after Tiananmen Squareshould be to declare with royal authority that Britain shares the concerns of the Hong Kong people and is determined to do something about themThere was already a rather perfunctory air to the Queen's visit three years agoas if it were just a required coda to her tour of ChinaWhen the Prince and Princess of Wales quite rightly scrapped their tour of the mainlandthey had the opportunity to make a contrasting point in Hong KongUnless they can say something relevant in the next four daysthe many Hong Kong critics who believe the visit is a waste of dollars will be absolutely rightIt did not help at all that upon arrival yesterday the royal couple instantly touched base in that comforting symbol of past British powerthe Hong Kong and Shanghai BankIf there is a failure of imagination to use the royal visit creatively it will also be a failure of nerveBritain still cannot decide when to play the mandarinate game of silence with the Chinese and when to break the rules as Beijing does all the timeThe ideal tactics should be a mixture of bothbut only if a clear message can be communicated to the Hong Kong people that someone is standing up for them somewhereInstead the latest developments in Sino-British relations have left them even more confused than beforeChina claims that the Hong Kong Government recently gave a written commitment to limit the activities of the pro-democracy movement in the territoryThe government denies thisbut has published the text of a letter from its Political Adviser to the New China News Agency Beijing's embassy in Hong Kongsuggesting that it didIn a tone of meek appeasementthe letter draws attention to the arrest by Hong Kong police of anti-China demonstrators outside the agency's National Day receptionIt also reminds Beijing that permission has been refused for local protesters to erect a replica Statue of Democracy on a permanent siteIt ends by assuring Beijing that the Hong Kong Government will have a prudent regard for the special circumstances of Hong Kong and the interests and concerns of the Chinese GovernmentMeanwhile the flood of letters of a very different sort from anxious Hong Kong citizens to this and every other newspaper office continuesSo do the Chinese press statements asserting that Hong Kong is entirely a business between China and Britainand should not be discussedformally or informallyat any international forumThe only two Hong Kong legislators who consistently dare to speak outMr Martin Lee and Mr Szeto Wahhave been threatened with expulsion from the committee now drafting China's post-1997 Basic LawOur latest Foreign Secretary has yet to publicly pick up the file marked Hong KongThere is still endless dithering on how broad a safety netBritain will extend to its citizensThey may rightly feel that it is all really rather appallingLetters to the EditorBlack set to be US governorTHE black

foreshadowing important changes in the make-up of the Communist Party's powerful politburo and policy shifts in response to continuing popular pressureThe resignation of the Communist-dominated cabinet was announced at a press conference by the newly-appointed government spokesmanMr Wolfgang MeyerAs he spokeseveral thousand East Germans demonstrated outside the central committee building in East Berlin where the politburo was locked in critical talksThe government's resignation is the most sweeping political change in East Germany's 40-year historyCommentators said Mr Egon Krenzthe new party leader and head of stateand the politburo would now have to act swiftly to call free elections as the only way out of the crisisThe Bonn government said the resignation was insufficient and free elections must followThe stepping down of the government followed resignation calls from all five of East Germany's minor political partiesand from a deputy minister of cultureThey said the cabinet's resignation could only be a first step in an attempt to regain credibilityLed by the Prime MinisterMr Willi Stophaged 75the government will continue in a caretaker role until a new cabinet is chosenThe demonstrators again demanded that Mr Krenz should step downThey also pressed for free electionsIt had become increasingly clear over the last few days that the anger of East Germans is focused on the Communist Party and that it can only be a question of time before the party has to relinquish its leading role and allow political competitionThe 160-member central committee today discusses changes in policy and the country's leadershipThe East German leadership's dilemma was underlined by mass demonstrations in a dozen cities on Monday night and the continuing flight of young East Germans yesterday through CzechoslovakiaSince Saturday30,000 refugees have reached West Germanycrossing the border at a rate of about 200 an hourMr Meyer implored East Germans to remainOur Socialist fatherland needs each and every oneA leading East Berlin churchmanMr Manfred Stolpesaid he feared Mr Krenz's reform offers had already been overtaken by events and people's hopesMr Stolpe said East Germans had recently discovered their powerand Mr Krenz had not succeeded in restoring the leadership's credibilityIn further pressure on East German leadersacademics at the influential Potsdam Academy sent an open letter to the central committeeIt said that the party's ignorant and arrogant behaviour over the years towards reserved and moderate criticism provoked the crisisMeanwhilethere were signs last night that the Interior Ministry is about to recognise the country's biggest opposition groupNew ForumFor the first time last nightthe official ADN news agency published a statement by the groupand a regional newspaper printed a catalogueof New Forum demands yesterdayAn East German parliamentary committee yesterday dismissed a draft travel lawsaying that the 30 days' travel to be granted a year in no way met people's expectationsMr Krenz has already announced the dismissal of five old guardpolitburo membersincluding the hardline Interior MinisterGeneral Erich MielkeBut it is widely expected that further heads will have to roll if the discredited Communist Party is to retrieve the situationChallenge for Krenzpage 23 Bonn will benefit from refugee influxpage 10Army takes over in 999 disputeBy Keith HarperDavid Brindle and Patrick WintourTROOPS will be used to provide emergency ambulance cover in London from this afternoon in what the unions yesterday described as a political attempt by the Government to escalate the disputeArmy ambulances were put on standby although government sources last night admitted they had no idea who would drive themA number of army drivers and some civilian Ministry of Defence drivers are availablebut not enough to cover a 24-hour periodMoreovernone of the possible drivers have any knowledge of inner London routesHealth service managers fear the project will failUnion leaders said drivers would need police navigatorsThe decision to use the army was taken by the Health SecretaryMr Kenneth Clarkedespite the fact that ambulance staff are still offering emergency coverMr Clarke's decision followed the suspension of 2,500 staff at 71 London stations for refusing to work normallyThe crews want an increase on a 6.5 per cent pay offerMinisters and unions last night said they despaired of ending the disputeA last minute attempt by the London employers to open talks this morning was turned down by union leadersMr Duncan Nicholthe NHS chief executivetold the Guardian yesterday that the Government's negotiating position is that it wants to split the service so crews with medical skills can earn extra money and non-emergency services can be contracted outMr Nichol said the Government wants to settle the dispute with a deal that would allow local managers to top up the pay of crews with paramedical skills in a move towards the separation of the 999 service from routine ambulance workIt would give designated emergency crews the chance to achieve pay parity with firemenAccording to Mr Nicholsuch a deal could increase pay rates in London by 30 per cent and elsewhere by 20 per centIt would be a step towards a likely decision to put non-emergency services out to contractThis has already begun in some parts of the countryThe idea was immediately rejected by the main health service unionNupewhich said last night the Government was trying to split the ambulance staffWe want a pay deal now to solve all our problems and a formula which would prevent us from taking action in futurea spokesman saidThe Government's formal negotiating stance on pay was set out by Mr Clarkewho said there was no question of increasing the general 6.5 per cent offerThe troops will join the policewho were reluctantly involved yesterday after the London ambulance service said it could not copeThe employers admitted troops would provide an inferior serviceMr Clarke saidI see no reason why the NHS management should give a higher offer in response to industrial action and then have to close down beds and reduce patient services to pay for itMr Nicholhoweversaid there was plenty to talk aboutincluding the idea of a local flexibility dealput at the conciliation serviceAcastwo weeks agoThe proposed deal would be modelled on a settlement this year for 130,000 NHS administrative and clerical staffMr Nichol said ambulance staff could receive pay premiums worth more than £3,000in recognition of extra traininglocal recruitment problems and other factors such as merit or long serviceOnly 10 per cent of the 20 million annual ambulance journeys are emergenciesAt presentcrews typically rotate between 999 and routine workmaking it difficult to designate crews for higher payIt is the first time troops have been brought in during an industrial dispute since 1978Mr Clarke told

into the Clapham Junction train crash criticised British Rail for allowing working practices to slip to unacceptable and dangerouslevelsThe report by Sir Anthony Hidden QCpublished yesterdaysaid there is a collective liability which lies with British RailThe Director of Public Prosecutions will decide in the next few weeks if BR must face corporate manslaughter charges over the disaster on December 12 which claimed 35 livesThe crash in south London was caused by faulty wiring undertaken by the 11 signal engineers and managers during the signal modernisationBut Sir Anthony found no common link with later crashes at Purley and GlasgowHoweverthe driver of a train involved in the Purley crash earlier this year has been charged with manslaughterHe is due to appear in court on November 16While the report does not specifically link the disaster with cuts in government fundsministers will be under pressure to demonstrate that safety is not being impaired by tight cash limitsThe results of recent behind-the-scenes attempts by Mr Cecil Parkinsonthe Transport Secretaryto win extra funds from the Treasury for transport infrastructure are due to be unveiled this weekThe BR chairmanSir Robert Reidsaid last night the board accepted in full the findings and 93 recommendations of the Hidden reportIt catalogued positively dangerouswork practicespoor managementinadequate training and supervision and inherent weakness in the safety culture of BR in a list of 16 separate relevant errorswhere things had gone wrong over a number of yearsSir Anthony stopped short of blaming BR or the Government for creating the climate but addedThere must be a better way of doing thingsMr Parkinson is to meet Sir Robert today for discussions on how to meet the demanding scheduleimposed by Sir Anthony's recommendationsMr Parkinson told the Commons yesterday that BR would be given three months to report on its progressMr Parkinson has ordered BR to implement the safety recommendationsincluding installation of airline-type black boxes in rail cabsmore safety inspectorstrain cab radios and research into rolling stockIn a separate developmentBR yesterday contacted the four rail unions asking for urgent talks on a review of pay and working practices in its signalling and telecommunications divisionIt hopes to make a fresh attempt to limit excessive overtimeheavily criticised in the reportSir Anthony said the overtime system was outdated and wastefulHe also warned the present pay structure was failing to provide the correct size and quality of workforceMr John PrescottLabour's transport spokesmancondemned government transport policiessaying signalling staff cuts were a direct result of the 51 per cent cut in BR finances in the past five yearsSir Anthony said BR should ensure the organisational framework exists to prevent commercial considerations of a business-led railway from compromising safetyMr Parkinson told the Commons in responseBR will need to consider what further expenditure will be requiredI can assure the House that finance will not stand in the way of implementation of the reportSir Robert last night rejected calls for his resignation and explained that 50 of the recommendations made by Sir Anthony were already in hand or implemented at an estimated cost of £20 millionAs I said after the accidents at Clapham and Purleymy job as I see it is to make sure that we implement all the recommendationsBut he also disclosed that the 11 BR employees singled out for specific criticism by the Hidden inquiry would face

hangingBy John Carvel Home Affairs EditorTHE Home Secretary has told colleagues that he expects a fresh Commons debate on the death penalty before the next election and that he would speak and vote for its restoration as a deterrent for some murdersWhile Mr David Waddington does not intend to use his office to promote capital punishmentand will maintain the tradition of a free vote for MPshis intervention in a renewed debate would provide the most passionate support for it from the Government front bench since it was abolished in 1965The vehicle for raising the issue again will be the Criminal Justice Bill which Mr Waddington expects to introduce in the 1990/91 parliamentary sessionThe bill's main purpose will be to encourage non-custodial punishment in the community for less serious offendersbut ministers believe that the opportunity presented by debate on the measure will be taken to promote the cause of hangingIn the Commons vote in June last year a majority of 123 was against any changeand MPs believed the issue had been settled for this ParliamentMr Waddington believes that the death penalty would offer the public protection in deterring some people from murderWhether he wants to limit the penalty to certain categories of murder or whether he favours leaving its use to the discretion of the courts and the Home Secretary is not clearHe is understood to be pressing ahead with the rest of the agenda set by his predecessorMr Douglas Hurdincluding a white paper proposing less use of imprisonment for non-violent offendersHe is also expected to confirm Mr Hurd's decision to ignore the European Court's ruling against seven-day detentions under the Prevention of Terrorism ActHome Office crime statistics for 1988 published yesterday show that the peak age of offending by male offenders rose from 15 to 18largely because fewer juveniles were charged with shopliftingBirmingham Six case stays closedBy John Carvel and Paul HoylandMR DAVID Waddingtonthe Home Secretaryhas decided not to reopen the Birmingham Six pub bombings case despite an appeal by the city's leading churchmenMr Waddington is prepared to accept a request by Mr Gerry Collinsthe Irish Foreign Ministerto discuss the caseBut Home Office officials indicated thatin the absence of new evidenceMr Waddington would make it clear that he would be unable to take any initiativeCampaigners for the Birmingham Six had hoped that a new Home Secretary might reconsider the convictions in the light of the discovery that the confessions of those convicted of the Guildford pub bombings had been fabricatedand the subsequent release of the fourMr Waddington is understood to take the view that the Court of Appeal last year reassessed the Birmingham confessions before concluding that they were properly taken and voluntarily givenHe stands by the decision of his predecessorMr Douglas Hurdthat there is no need for further investigationThe question of whether the convictions were safeand the need for a review to allay public anxiety in the light of the Guildford findingsis raised in a statement by the joint presidents of the Birmingham Council of Christian Churchesthe Most Reverend Maurice Couve de MurvilleArchbishop of Birminghamthe Right Reverend Mark SanterBishop of Birminghamand the Reverend David Goodrepresenting the Birmingham Free ChurchesThey doubt whether the Court of Appeal would reach the same conclusion today as it had last year about the reliability of the convictionssince the Guildford case had raised questions on the adequacy of reviews of possible wrongful convictionThey also note that an inquiry is being conducted into alleged malpractice by the serious crime squad of the West Midlands forceJustice is not served by even the slightest suspicion of injusticethe Rt Rev Santer said yesterdayTwenty-one people were killed and 167 injured in the explosions at two Birmingham city centre pubs in 1974Kinnock reshuffle brings back Clare Short and puts

HattersleyAlthough he never made his views publiche is believed to have argued in favour of the review group supporting some form of electoral reformThere was strong criticism amongst black Labour Party members last year when no black was appointed to the front bench in that year's reshuffle and again when Mr Alistair Darlingthe MP for Edinburgh Centralwas given the race relations briefMr

the soldiersput them on the streets of London as easy targets for the terroristsManagement yesterday began suspending ambulance staff in retaliation to the work to rule tactics of the unionsThe troops' intervention in the ambulance strike is being authorised under a Whitehall arrangement which enables one department to request military aid to the civil ministriesfrom the Ministry of Defence and pay the bill afterwardsThis arrangement means there is no need for Mrs Thatcher to consider declaring a State of Emergencyas Mr Heath's government did during the 1973 miners' strikeThat would only be necessary if the troops had been requisitioning other people's equipmentMrs Thatcher has never declared a state of emergencyTroops have been used more than 30 times since the second world war to replace striking workersDuring the 1970s they were called out to clear hundreds of tons rubbish from the streets of Glasgow during the 1975 dustmen's strikeTwo years later dozens of Green Goddess

Political CorrespondentANOTHER Conservative heavyweight was publicly aligned against Mrs Thatcher over Europe last night when Sir Leon Brittanvice-president of the European Commissiondenounced the dangerous illusion of total sovereigntyas an impediment in battles for a free-market Europe already largely wonHe called for British entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism in months rather than years and the creation of a European central bank with one pound equals xecuson bank notesHe even envisaged the absorption of East Germany into the Twelvenot as a new state but as an extension of the territory of an existing memberAs the Prime Minister reproached Mr Nigel Lawson for resigning the Chancellorship with such suddenness and hasteand over personality not policy her isolation was highlighted by the ex-minister whose enforced resignation in the Westland affair of 1986 is being likened by disaffected MPs to the recent sacrifice of Mr LawsonDelivering the annual Granada LectureSir Leon outlined a programme for achieving a prosperous and non-bureaucratic European Communitybut its main thrust amounted to a rebuttal of her highly-personalised terms for further progress towards economic and monetary unionIt is likely to intensify pressure for flexibility in the summit run-upSovereignty is not something that you either have or do not havelike a family heirloom which you take out and dust every now and then to make sure that it is still in your possession and still intactSir Leon saidSovereigntyratheris in today's world a severely practical conceptthe ability to have the maximum possible say in determining one's own futurein circumstances that actually existThe former Home Secretary took common ground with Mrs Thatcher in opposing a Brussels-dominated and economically illiberal Fortress Europeand went much further than Mr Lawson or the pro-European cabinet majority in calling for a central bank on the looser American rather than Bundesbank modelBut in even-handedly denouncing ardent Europhiles and Europhobes as superannuated Sumo wrestlershe wasin effectaccusing Downing Street of being out of dateeven on worker participation in industry and the

Marketing Board officials knew for weeks that milk contaminated with lead was on saleWhitehall sources indicated yesterdayMr John Gummerthe Agriculture Ministersaid yesterday that swift action was taken last weekend after the Dutch authorities informed him that tonnes of cattle feed contaminated with lead had been shipped to BritainBut it later emerged that the first of three contaminated cargoes arrived on October 5Restriction orders banning cattle movement and sale of milk and meat have now been imposed on more than 300 farmsmostly in Cornwall and Devon but also in the MidlandsMore than 20 animalsmostly calveshave died from lead poisoningTests on milk have revealed lead levels of 20 parts a billionhigher than normal but within government guidelines of 50 parts a billionThe milk board insisted yesterday it was not aware of any problem until last FridayBut routine screening of milk for contaminants should have disclosed higher lead levels by mid-OctoberSources say the lead contamination was first identified by ministry and board officials in mid to late OctoberRather than being thrown awaythe contaminated milk was poured into tanks of clean milk to dilute the lead down to permissible levelsThe ministry said yesterday that it was first warned by the Dutch on November 1 that 550 tonnes of Indian rice bran contaminated with lead sulphate had come via Rotterdam to Teignmouth in DevonFifty tonnes escaped a ministry ban and went to farmsDr David ClarkLabour's agriculture spokesmansaidIt was entirely irresponsible of the ministry to allow farmers for nearly a week to feed contaminated material to animalsWe suspect the problem is worse than Mr Gummer has admitted and we question why there was a delay in warning the publicHe called on the Government to ensure that no more contaminated meat or milk is allowed to enter the food chain and demanded that all test results be publishedThe ministry has faced criticism for permitting the sale of milk produced by cows injected with the experimentalgenetically engineered drug BST as the identity of farms and dairies taking part in the experiments is kept secretUN peace force for Central AmericaBy Jane Rosen in New YorkTHE UN Security Council voted unanimously last night to send a peacekeeping force to Central America to cut off infiltration by contra rebelsmonitor elections in Nicaragua and watch over developments in other sensitive areas especially Honduras and El SalvadorThis is the first time the UN has dispatched a force so close to American bordersThe 625-strong observer forcewhich will have a six-month renewable mandateis the first in the Western hemisphereThe force is also intended to block weapons shipments sent from Honduras to Salvadorean rebelsThe initial call for UN action came from foreign ministers of the five Central American countries last springThey asked the Secretary General to set up a group to monitor compliance with Central American commitments to halt aid to rebel movements and to prevent the use of one state's territory for attacks on other statesThe US finally agreed to support the force after six months of negotiationsHoweverthe American ambassadorMr Thomas Pickeringtold the council yesterday that Washington's approval was based on the assumption that the force would take steps to halt aid for Salvadorean guerrillasThe force's immediate task is to ensure free elections in Nicaraguaand the Nicaraguan delegates said they expected to play a very positive roleThe Nicaraguan ambassador said it should contribute significantly to impeding the infiltration of contra forces into Nicaraguan territoryThe force is known as Onuca a Spanish acronym for US Observer Group For Central AmericaIt will be composed of observers from SpainWest Germany and Canada and is scheduled to be deployed in the area by the end of the monthThe Secretary-GeneralMr Javier Perez de Cuellarsaid he would cautiously deploy the peace force in stagesThe need for the operationisif

give shareholders the right to decide on company donations to political partiesBy 223 votes to 110 Government majority 113peers rejected an Opposition amendment to the Companies Billoriginally passed by the Lords but rejected later in the CommonsThis insisted that shareholders sanctioned such donations before they were made instead of only being able to discuss them afterwardsLord Williams of

would make the conduct of business more difficultLawson resignation incomprehensibleQuestion timeMartin LintonTHE Lawson affair rumbled on in the Commons yesterday with the Labour leaderMr Neil Kinnockasking the Prime Minister why she did not tell the truthwhen she was asked why the former Chancellor of the Exchequer resigned by television interviewer Brian WaldenThe answer she gave was not that she didn't know Mr Lawson's stated reason for resigningbut that she found it incomprehensibleIf he had wanted to resign on a point of policyI could have understood thatPolicy is a matter for ministersshe said at question timeBut I find it totally incomprehensible if someone has held the office of Chancellor with high standing for six years to want to resign over a personality with such suddenness and hasteThe clash came as Mr Kinnock exploited the apparent contradiction between Mrs Thatcher's claim that she did not know why Mr Lawson resigned and the former Chancellor's assertion in last Sunday's Walden interview that he had made it quite clear to the Prime Minister that Sir Alan Walter's continued presence as her economic adviser was the only issueMr Kinnock saidYou appear to be the only person left in the country who does not understand why the Chancellor resignedIsn't the truth that the Chancellor said to you either the adviser goes by the end of the year or I go nowWhy can't you admit to that truthMrs Thatcher repliedPolicy is a matter for ministers advice is notShe addedreferring to the two meetings she held with Mr Lawson on the afternoon before he resignedI tried to persuade the Chancellor not to goIt was quite clear he was determined to go and go that dayMrs Thatcher later parried more questions when the Liberal Democrat Mr Charles Kennedy RossCromarty and Skyeasked her whether she felt her diminishing credibilitywould be salvaged if she followed the advice of the former chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 CommitteeSir Edward du Cannthat a leadership challenge would clear the airIn the event of such a development does she think her position would be unassailablehe asked echoing the Prime Minister's earlier comment that Mr Lawson's position was unassailableBut Mrs Thatcher retortedA party that can't even decide its name is hardly in a position to criticise anyoneThe Prime Minister has again denied that there had been any direct British assistance to the Khmer Rouge in CambodiaIn a letter to Mr Kinnock released last nightshe saidYou ask about support for the Khmer RougeThe Government's repugnance for that organisation and everything it stands for has been made absolutely clear on repeated occasionsNo form of British assistancemilitary or otherwisehas beenor will begiven to the Khmer RougeBut she did not reply directly to Labour's allegations that the Government had provided aid to others who were supporting the Pol Pot forcesHigh cost of taking the strain Wednesday PeopleDennis BarkerFIVE children lying bloody and broken in

British initiativesMrs Thatcher will today announce that she is to double the British contribution of £3 million to the UN Environment Project in Nairobi and give new money to tropical rain forest

large economies found it difficult to commit themselves to targets which had not been properly explored and before the International Panel on Climate Change reports scientific evidence next yearThis panelwith three committees chaired by Britainthe US and Soviet Unionis examining the evidence for the UN before recommending how to reduce gas emissionsEnvironmental groups believe that because the big industrial nations control these committees and are anxious to avoid curbs on industry and car usethey are using this scientific research as an excuse for taking no actionMr Steve ElsworthGreenpeace air pollution campaignersaidBritain's contribution at the Dutch conference was to undermine efforts to set any date or make any real targets to deal with global warmingMr Trippier then claims the conference as a successwhich clearly it is notBritain is all talk and no actionIt is an internationally co-ordinated public relations exercise with no solid content in itMrs Thatcher will today emphasise the central role of the UN in global environmental issuesShe will attack the Hague declarationa French initiative signed on March 12this yearwhere 24 heads of state proposed a UN agency empowered to impose sanctions on governments that did not reduce emissions of greenhouse gasesBritain and the US ignored the conferenceMrs Thatcher argues that sanctions are not the right course and only consensus will workThis weekat the International Timber Trade Organisation's conference in JapanBritain was supported by green groups when it suggested a labelling scheme for tropical hardwood so consumers could choose products manufactured from sustainable timber reservesBut the initiative was rejected by the countries where tropical forests are being indiscriminately felled for

Westminster CorrespondentALLEGATIONS that the Department of Trade and Industry may have lost the taxpayer millions of pounds over the sale of the Rover Group to British Aerospace are to be made by the National Audit OfficeParliament's financial watchdogA report to be published later this month is understood to detail a series of shortcomings in the rushed sale of the motor company to the group which was approved by Lord Youngthe former Trade SecretaryThe companywith plants in the West MidlandsOxfordGlasgow and Llanelli in south Waleswas sold for £150 million which British Aerospace later recouped by floating its half share of DAF-Leyland on the stock marketThe report which examines the civil servants' handling of the sale is understood to question why British Aerospace was the only main bidder where detailed and full inquiries were madeIt also looks at the potential profits which British Aerospace may be able to make by selling redundant sites in LlanelliBathgate in Glasgow and the Cowley plant in Oxford which is due to close in the 1990sWhitehall sources indicated last night that the scale of the criticism in the report dwarfs the recent furore following the National Audit Office's investigation into the sale of land in Enfieldnorth London owned by the Royal Ordnance Factories to British AerospaceIn this casea row started over land worth £3.5 million being possibly resold for more than £30 million once the development potential of the closed factory sites had been realisedMr Terry DavisLabour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hilltold the Guardian last nightAs a former employee of British Leyland and now a member of the Commons public accounts committeeI pressed for an inquiry into the saleAlthough I have not seen the reportit does not surprise me that the Rover Group was sold for a songI believe the company was sacrificedI shall be demanding that we have a full explanation from Department of Trade and Industry officials when they appear before the public accounts committee to be cross-examined on this report on December 4British Aerospace has already admitted that Rover's assets were undervalued by £350 million at the time of the takeoverThe Government wiped out all Rover's debts as part of the dealdespite the company's annual profits of £100 millionWhy Nigel just had to go Points of OrderBy Ian AitkenPOINTS of Order couldn't help visualising the scene in Number 10 Downing Street a week last Thursdaywhen the lad from next door burst in to say his pieceIf all the subsequent television and newspaper interviews are to be believedthe boy Lawson told Mrs Thatcher that he jolly well wasn't going to stay on as Chancellor unless she fired that rotter Walters as her adviserThe lad's message was quite clearIt wasEither he goes or I goAnd it is now equally clear that Mrs Thatcher's response to this ultimatum was similarly directIt could be summarised asIn that caseNigelwhy don't you **** offAnd while you're at ittake your 7.6 per cent inflation rate with youThere have been horrified reactions to this eventMany people say that it demonstrates Mrs Thatcher's deplorable indifference to the relative importance of a senior Cabinet colleague and a mere half-cock academic adviserIt showsthey claimthat she prefers personal favourites to ministersBUT suppose she'd reacted differentlySuppose she hadn't invited Mr Lawson to **** offSuppose she'd saidDear Nigelof course you must have your waySir Alan will be fired before the goose gets fatYouand your 7.6 per cent inflation rateand your 15 per cent interest rateand your £20 billion trade deficithave my fullest confidenceYou must remain my ChancellorWould Mr Lawson then have resisted the temptation to trundle round his Cabinet colleaguesshowing off his muscles and boasting that he alone had faced up to the Iron Lady and wonAnd if he had made that boastwould it have remained privy to the colleaguesAnd once it was outwhere would Mrs Thatcher's authority have beenBUT there are two further aspects to this affairFor a startdidn't Mrs Thatcher have some justification for concluding that Mr Lawson had deliberately chosen the Walters row as an excuse for abandoning shipCertainly his resignation ensures that he will be in the clear when the economic roof falls in an event which many people now regard as virtually inevitableThe second aspect is the extent to which recent events prove that politicians should avoid expressing the obviousbecause it always leads to troubleTakefor instancethe brouhaha which has followed Mrs Thatcher's hint that she will probably retire sometime between the next general election and the one after thatThis was made the payoff in the Sunday Correspondent's interview with the PMthough it has since emerged that the sequence of the conversation was alteredBut the weird thing about this supposedly shock admissionis that everyone made the most dreadful fuss when she said she intended to go on and on and onNow she says that she won't go on for everResultan even more dreadful fussYet by normal standards her cautious words she's 64after all were no more than simple common senseJust think what the reaction might have been if she's responded by saying she had no plans to quitEverThe same applies to poor Mr Peter Brooke's weekend remarks about the possibility of talking to Sinn Feinif and when

FerrersIs this a fair swapArmy to take emergency callsBy Keith HarperDavid Brindle and Patrick WintourTROOPS will be used to provide emergency cover in London from 2pm today in what the unions yesterday described as a politicalattempt by the Government to escalate the ambulance disputeThe decision to use the armyeven though ambulance crews are not on strike but still offering to provide an emergency servicewas taken by Mr Kenneth Clarkethe Health Secretaryas Mr Duncan Nicholthe National Health Service chief executivetold the Guardian that the Government's negotiating position included a desire to offer extra pay to paramedical crewsMr Clarke's decision followed the suspension of 2,500 ambulance crew members at 71 London stations for refusing to work normallyThe crews want an increase on a 6.5 per cent pay offerMr Nichol said that the Government wants to settle the dispute with a deal that would allow local managers to top up the pay of crews with paramedical skills in a move towards the separation of the 999 service from routine ambulance workIt would give designated emergency crews the chance to achieve their goal of pay parity with firefightersAccording to Mr Nicholsuch a deal could increase pay rates in London by 30 per cent and elsewhere by 20 per centand would be a step toward a likelydecision to put non-emergency services out to contractThis has already begun in some parts of the countryincluding WiltshireThe idea was immediately rejected by the main health service unionNupewhich said last night that the Government was trying to split the ambulance staffWe want a pay deal now to solve all our problems and a formula which would prevent us from taking action in futureThe Government's formal negotiating stance on pay was set out by Mr Clarkewho said there was no question of increasing the general 6.5 per cent offerMr Clarke saidI see no reason why the NHS management should give a higher offer in response to industrial action and then have to close beds and reduce patient services to pay for itMr Nicholhoweversaid there was plenty to talk aboutincluding the idea of a local flexibility dealwhich was put at the conciliation service Acas two weeks agoThe idea would be modelled on a settlement this year for 130,000 NHS administrative and clerical staffMr Nichol said ambulance staff could receive pay premiums worth more than £3,000in recognition of extra traininglocal recruitment problems and other factors such as meritorious or long serviceOnly 10 per cent of the 20 million annual ambulance journeys are emergenciesAt presentcrews typically rotate between 999 and routine work making it difficult to designate crews for higher payToday will be the first time troops have been brought in during an industrial dispute since 1978Mr Clarke told the House of Commons that he was doing it with the great reluctanceThe House was called to order at one stage by the SpeakerMr Bernard Weatherhillafter Mr Clarke accused crews of waiting at stations pretendingto be ready for workMr Robin Cookthe shadow Health Secretarywho advised the Government to call in the arbitrators rather than the armysaid that Mr Clarke had given no good explanation for his precipitate actionThe troops will join the policewho were reluctantly involved yesterday after the London Ambulance Service said that it could not copeThe employers admitted the troops would provide an inferior serviceMr Chris Spryfor the London Ambulance Servicesaid the army's help was sought because crews were not using their radios to answer emergency callsMr Roger Poolethe unions' chief negotiatorsaid the Government was putting Londoners' lives at riskAll ambulance crews would continue to stand by at their stations for 999 callsThis is a crass decision by Mr Clarke and the Government is playing a dangerous gameThe action taken in London had an immediate affect elsewhere as ambulance crews began to protest at the Government's interventionGreater Manchester union officials agreed to halt all routine work in protest against suspensionsand Welsh crews promised to stage work-ins if suspensions went aheadSoldiers in front linepage 3Leader commentpage 22Duncan Nichol interviewpage 23Runcie plea pushes synod to back women priestsBy Walter SchwarzReligious Affairs CorrespondentALAST-MINUTE call for courage by the Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday pushed a tense and hesitant General Synod into a vote that clears the way for ordination of women priestsThe proposal will be debated in dioceses before being returned to the synod for final approval in 1991The votewhich excludes ordination of women as bishopsneeded only a simple majorityBut final approval in 1991 will require a two-thirds majority in all three houses bishopsclergy and laityYesterday's majority323-170failed to achieve that in anyA split was avoided when the synod rejected proposals to allow a separate church of those who refused to accept women priestsNerves were calmed when Dr Robert Runcie said ordaining women was development rather than revolutionAnother sharp prod came from the Bishop of DurhamDr David Jenkinswho said women should not be the victims of political votingby members who cared more about church divisions than justice for womenHe said such voting makes women bear the burden of a political judgmentI believe this to be indecent and to add to the already indecent burden women are having to bearThe role of Dr Runciewho has wavered in the pastwas crucialSupporters of women priests feared his recent talks in Rome might have swung him into oppositionBut he said Roman Catholics and Anglicans have to acceptfor the momentour different ways of reaching decisionsThe vote came five years after the synod called for draft legislation to introduce women priestsA first draftgiving the clergy powers to block women priestsfrightened members including Dr Runcie and risked a splitDr Runcie then proposed a committee of bishops modify the rulesDr Runcie said the new rules tried to steer a course between what I described as legislative schism and a measure which would reduce to second class membership those who find themselves unable to recognise women priestsOpponents kept a low profile and their leaderDr Graham LeonardBishop of Londonremained silentThe opponents included Mr John Gummera synod memberwho saidFor many of us this is a matter of life and deathIf this is passed some of us will no longer be activeThe Venerable David SilkArchdeacon of Leicestersumming up the theological oppositionsaid that in ordaining women the Church of England would cease to be part of the Catholicapostolic church and would be behaving as if it were the whole of Christianityor a mere sectSome opponents said later that since none of the houses

conclusions about pay and conditions for its 7,000 S&T engineers after a review of manpower and reward systemsThe point has now been reached where we need to finalise this workA crippling recruitment and retention crisis has seen BR lose vital engineering staff to better paid jobs for example in British Telecom and Mercurywhere senior technicians' rates are up to £60 a week moreBR has had to rely on staff working excessive overtime to carry out maintenance and repair workPay ratesovertime central issues in this summer's pay dispute and repeated restructuring of the S&T divisionare attacked in Sir Anthony Hidden's reportBR accepts that measures imposed in mid-1988 to ease staff retention problems have failedGrading was simplified then and S&T staff were offered an extra £1,200 a year in skills allowances subject to satisfactory attendance and workingbut skills shortages continueMr Jimmy Knappgeneral secretary of the National Union of Railwaymensaid yesterday that BR had since moved to stem excessive overtime by ordering a maximum working week of 72 hoursThe basic week is 39 hoursHe went onBR have not talked to us about limiting overtimebut it says a lot about the industry when limiting shifts to 12 hours a day is considered progressThe consequence of the reduction had been to put resignalling work around Waterloo which led to the Clapham disaster two months behind scheduleBR said it had taken steps to control overtime and to ensure engineers were taking breaks in the hard pressed Southern Regionwhere skills shortages are most acuteOn pay the Clapham report said it was abundantly clearthat pay levels had failed to provide BR with the overall sizestructure and quality of workforceit neededConstraints on recruiting are constraints on safety and have to be removedThe report also criticises the rail unions for entrenched resistance to changeEvidenceparticularly Mr Knapp'sproved how deep was the mistrust and suspicion employer had for union and union had for employerThe BR chairman Sir Robert Reid told a press conference in London yesterdayI accept all the inquiry's recommendations here and nowWe have taken steps to ensure that the circumstances that led to this tragedy can never be repeatedBritish Rail is investigating the role of temporary hand-signalling in a head-on crash between two trains at Huddersfield which injured 17 people on Monday nightNo one was badly hurt in the accident between a trans-Pennine service and a local commuter train on track where modernised signalling is being installedTwo newspapers appeal against Spycatcher book convictions for contemptTWO national newspapersthe Independent and the Sunday Timesyesterday asked the Court of Appeal to quash their convictions last May for contempt of court in publishing extracts from the Spycatcher book while a ban was in force against two other papersThe contempt proceedings began in 1987 when the Attorney-GeneralSir Patrick Mayhewalleged that the newspapers' conduct in publishing material from Spycatcherthe memoirs of former MI5 officer Peter Wrightwas intendedor was likely tothwart the publication ban obtained by the Government in July 1986 against the Guardian and the ObserverMr Richard AikensQCfor the Independentsaid that ironically the subject matter had now been held by the House of Lords not to have been confidentialin the sense that in October last year the Law Lords refused to grant permanent injunctions against the Observer and the Guardianruling in favour of freedom of speechMr Aikens said that to prove contempt the Attorney-General had to establish that the published information was confidentialIt had to be proved that the papers had put into the public domain information which was not already there and whichin the context of the present caseit was in the public interest should not be thereThat was the test applied in October 1988The Attorney-General also had to establish that the information complained of was the subject matter of the pending action against the Guardian and the ObserverFurtherhe had to show that the publication had the effect of destroying the subject matter and so depriving him of his rights in advance of trialThe touchstonewould be if the Attorney-General was less ableby virtue of the actions of the Independentto obtain or continue an injunction against the Guardian and the ObserverMr Aikens submitted that the Attorney- General did not attempt to establish any of those requirementsThe striking fact was that his ability to obtain or retain interlocutory injunctions against the Guardian and the Observer was wholly unaffectedby the Independent's publication of Spycatcher material in April 1987The proof the pudding was in the eatingThe Lords had initially upheld the interlocutory injunctions although the House subsequently refused to make the injunctions permanentThe hearing continuesColeridge biography in the running for £20,250 prizeBy Tim Radford Literary

GreenQCis expected to decide within a few weeks whether to press corporate manslaughter charges against British Railthe Crown Prosecution Service said yesterdayA senior QC is studying the British Transport police report and will recommend if any charges should be laidHe will be sent a copy of Sir Anthony Hidden's report but will base his recommendations on the criminal investigation by British Transport Policea CPS spokesman saidBut lawyers expressed doubtsThey were very negligent but they were not criminally negligentsaid one barristerA manslaughter conviction would require proof of recklessness orpossiblygross negligenceCorporate manslaughter charges were almost unknown in English law before the DPP decided last June to issue manslaughter summonses against P&O European Ferries after the Zeebrugge disaster and there are still no firm judicial rulings on whether corporate manslaughter exists as a crimeIn Glamorgan in 1965 a company responsible for the collapse of a bridge was acquitted of manslaughter but the defence apparently never questioned whether a company can be guilty of manslaughterIn 1972 the Law Commission concluded that the crime of corporate manslaughter probablyexistsWhen the Zeebrugge families challenged the coroner in the High Court Lord Justice Bingham tentativelyaccepted that a company could be guiltyIn September the DPP decided not to bring corporate manslaughter charges against British Rail after four people died in October 1987 when a river bridge at GlanrhydDyfedWalesover which a train was travelling despite a red flood alertcollapsedTechnicians' wiring mistake caused disaster Dangerous practices and communication failures contributed to 35 deaths BR's slipshod style led to crash errorsBy David SharrockAFAILURE of the signalling system which occurred when a signal box wire that should have been removed was notthus preventing the signal from turning to red caused the Clapham rail disaster in which 35 people died last December 12according to the report of the inquiry chaired by Sir Anthony HiddenQCThe 56-day public inquiry heard 122 witnessesThe report lists many faultsinherent in the way the railway had been run for several yearsNoted as relevant to the Clapham accident were the factors thatWorking practices were permitted to slip to dangerous standards and quality of supervision was permitted to slip to an equivalent degreequality of testing did not meet BR standardsno proper system of training of installation and testing staff was in useand there was no vetting of weekend staff to prevent excessive overtimeand there was failure to communicate both up and down lines of managementThe fault which caused the Clapham crash is traced to the final installation of a new signalnumber WF138on November 271988by Mr Brian Hemingwaya senior technicianThere was nothing new in signal WF138's concept or installationthe report saysMr Hemingway's task on the weekend of November 26-27 was to connect the circuit's new wires and disconnect the old wire at both its relay end and its fuse endIn factno disconnection was made at the fuse endand although at the other relay end the old wire was disconnectedit was not cut back as it should have beennor was it secured out of the way of its previous contactIf the wrong circumstances aroseit was physically possible for the old wire to return to its old positionThose circumstances did ariseTwo weeks laterthe day before the accidentMr Hemingway was working on the signal againHis efforts disturbed the positions of the wiresThe consequences were not only unintendedthey were disastrousAs long as there was a large enough interval between trains running into Londonno train would be close enough to the one in front to be affected by the faulty signalShortly before 8.10am on December 12Mr Alex McClymontdriving the Basingstoke to Waterloo trainnoted that the signal was at redHe had unwillingly become involved in an incident known in railway jargon as a SPAD Signal Passed At DangerBR rules stipulated he must stop immediately and notify the signalmanWhen he did sohe would have been holding to an instinctive belief that the signal behind him would inevitably have gone to redThat belief would have been tragically wrongThe direct cause of the Clapham Junction accident was undoubtedly the wiring errors made by Mr Hemingwaythe report saysaddingHe has never sought to evade his reponsibility for the appalling consequences of his errorsnot one word of excuse came from Mr HemingwayThe blame for his characteristic errorssince they werehis normal working practicemust be a shared oneIt is a collective liability which lies on British RailThe cause of Mr Hemingway's uncharacteristic errorsfailing to see that the old wire was detached at the fuse end and insulated at the relay end is attributed to the long hours he workedIn the three months before the accidenthe had one sole day offI find this totally unacceptableBad wiring practices were compounded by a workforce which was adequate neither in size nor in skillsThe unions had to bear their share of responsibility for attitudes of entrenched resistance to changeFailure of arrangements for proper payment had also failed to provide BR with the overall sizestructure and quality of workforce neededThe inquiry said the deferment of projects involving large capital expenditurefrequency of reorganisation within BRand lack of control of projects did not stem from any individual's decisionbut from the way in which the railway has come to do thingsColony

Brindle and Patrick WintourTROOPS will be used in London from 2pm today to take ambulance emergency calls in what the unions regarded last night as a politicalattempt to escalate the disputeWith the call-up of the troops by Mr Kenneth Clarkethe Health Secretarycame fresh revelations yesterday that the Government wants to settle the dispute with a deal that would allow local managers to top up the pay of crews with special paramedical skillsThe move would be a decisive step towards the separation of the 999 service from routine ambulance workIt would give designated emergency crews the chance to achieve their goal of pay parity with firefightersMr Duncan Nicholthe National Health Service chief executivetold the Guardian that division of the service and the putting out to contract of non-emergency work was likelyAccording to Mr Nicholsuch a deal could increase pay rates in London by 30 per cent and elsewhere by 20 per centIt is already operating in Wiltshire and other parts of the countryThe idea was rejected by the main health service unionNupewhich said last night that the Government was trying to split the ambulance staffWe want a pay deal now to solve all our problems and a formula which would prevent us from taking action in futureThe Government's formal negotiating stance on pay was set out by Mr Clarkewho told a press conference there was no question of increasing the general 6.5 per cent offer to the ambulance crews in the face of disruptive actionThe troops will join the policewho were reluctantly involved yesterday in the capital after the London Ambulance Service said that it could not copeThe employers admitted that there would be an inferior serviceIt is the first time that troops have been brought in during an industrial dispute since the firemen's strike in 1978Mr Clarke told the House of Commons that he was doing it with great reluctanceThe difference between 1978 and now is that ambulance staff are not on strike but are working to ruleand answering all emergency callsMr Robin Cookthe shadow Health Secretarywho advised the Government to call in arbitrators rather than the armysaid that Mr Clarke had given no satisfactory explanation for his precipitate actionMr Roger Poolethe ambulance unions' chief negotiatorsaid that the Government was putting the lives of Londoners at riskAll ambulance crews would continue to stand by at their stations for 999 callsThis is a crass decision by Mr Clarke and the Government is playing dangerous gamehe saidMr Chris Spryfor the London Ambulance Servicesaid that the South West Thames regional health authority had asked for the army's helpAbout 50 military vehicles will supplement 53 from the police and voluntary organisationssuch as the St John AmbulanceThe sickest patients will be carried by voluntary groupsthe next by the armywith the least ill by the policeThe army will be based at police stations and will be allocated calls via the policeThe need to call in troopsaccording to Mr Sprybecame apparent by mid-afternoon yesterday when the police could not meet the demand for accident servicesMr Tom Crosbychief ambulance officer for Londonsaid the level of care would drop but insisted that the army crews had some medical training and were not basic infantry menMr Chris HumphreysLondon secretary of NupesaidIt is obvious that Kenneth Clarke intends to try and starve our members back to workThe Government cannot pretend to be concerned with security at army barracks and thenwithout regard for the soldiersput them on the streets of London as easy targets for the terroristsManagement yesterday began suspending ambulance staff in retaliation to the unions' work-to-rule tacticsMr Clarke said the armed forces would be withdrawn as soon as the unions agreed to provide a normal emergency serviceThe action taken in London had an immediate affect elsewhere as ambulance crews began to protest at the Government's interventionGreater Manchester union officials agreed to halt all routine work in protest against suspensionsand Welsh crews promised to stage work-ins if suspensions went aheadSoldiers in front linepage 3Leader commentpage 22Duncan Nichol interviewpage 23Soldiers in the front line of industrial strife David Fairhall on the discreet arrangement that has brought in the troopsTHE troops' intervention in the ambulance strike is not being authorised under the Emergency Powers Actbut under a Whitehall arrangement which enables one department to request military aid to the civil ministriesfrom the Ministry of Defence and pay the bill afterwardsThis discreet arrangement meansamong other thingsthat there was no need for Mrs Thatcher to consider declaring a state of emergencyas Mr Heath's government did during the 1973 miners' strikeThat would only have been necessary had the troops been requisitioning other people's equipmentrather than turning out with their own ambulancesTroops have been used more than 30 times since the second world war to replace striking workersDuring the 1970s they were called out to clear hundreds of tons rubbish from the streets of Glasgow during the 1975 dustmen's strikeTwo years later dozens of Green Goddess military fire engines were brought out of storage to cover the firemen's strikeIn 1974 military engineers stood by to operate power stations in Northern Ireland during the protest strike by the Protestant Ulster Workers' Councilthough they could have done nothing without the help of at least the power station managersDuring Mrs Thatcher's administrationtroops have found themselves involved in five industrial disputes to operate prisons in 1980/81to drive ambulances in 1981 and 1982to cover for civil servants during a dispute at the Coulport submarine base in 1981and to help with car parking during the rail strike of 1982Soldiers never like being asked to do somebody else's dirty workespecially if they have been called off leave to do itand are likely to be accused of strike breaking in the processOn the other hand they will readily respond to civil emergencies such as floodsIn this case the request for help falls somewhere between the extremes of the Glasgow dustmen's strike and straight humanitarian operations such as rescuing people from snowdriftsIn the latest situation troops are being drafted in to do jobs they normally do and for which they are trainedThe crews are mostly medical assistantswhich means possessing more than just a knowledge of first aidRichard Norton-Taylor addsContingency plans for the use of troops in ambulance disputes were drawn up shortly after the Government came to power in 1979Whitehall documents showThey were drafted by the Ministry of Defence and Department of HealthDepartment of Health officials wrote to regional administrators in 1980 with details of a new plan code-named Bittern providing for the use of service ambulances and drivers in the event of an industrial disputethe decision now taken yesterday by ministersTwo other plansnot activated in the present disputewere also drawn upOnecode-named Concorddealt with how the armed forces would drive NHS ambulancesThe other plancode-named Lionelrelated to limited service assistance in the event of a strike involving certain skilled and semi-skilled ancillary workersThe circular makes clear that a decision to implement the contingency plans would be subject to collective ministerial authorityThe Department of Health warned that the number of troops allocated may not be all forthcoming because of commitments elsewhereAny disclosure of information contained in the plansit saidwould be extremely damaging to the Government's industrial relations policyGlasgoing to be the host of a £60 million year-long cultural extravaganzaEUROPE'S

in the House of Bishops149 to 85 in the House of Clergy and 144 to 78 in the House of LaityThe matter will now be referred to dioceses for consultationThe Archbishop of CanterburyDr Robert Runcietold the synod it should receive the report in favour of the ordination of women with a steady nerveAfter two hours of debate the synod voted overwhelmingly to receive the report and moved on to detailed discussion of the legislationDr Runcie said he put his trust in the resilience of the Church of England to handle the debateI remain of the conviction that the ordination of women to the priesthood ought to be construed as an enlargement and extension of the historic Christian ministryhe saidIt cannot be irrelevant to evangelism that so many unbelievers think the place we give to women in the Church is frankly absurdHe still feared polarisation and the creation of monochrome dioceses where clergy opposed to women priests would leave dioceses where they were ordainedand women ordinands and deacons would leave dioceses where they could not become priestsThe legislation would have most impact on the diocesesand Dr Runcie was anxious the debate should be extended to the grassrootsThe motion was moved by the Rev Canon John Dale Worcesterwho said it was five years since the request for legislation on women priests was madeThe measure as revised by the committee tried as hard as possible to accommodate the views of those who object to women priestsIt creates space within the Church from which they can carry on their ministry for up to 20 yearsSpeaking against the motionthe

would be an enrichment to the ChurchHe was only disappointed that the legislation bent over backwards to accommodate those againstThe Bishop of Durhamthe Right Rev David Jenkinsasked why goodcaring and conscientious priests opposed to ordination of women should trouble collective consciences more than the women excluded from the ministrywho were being treated more and more as pawns in a political gameHoweverthe Right Rev Timothy BavinBishop of Portsmouthsaid there was no real agreement or consensus in the ChurchIf the legislation was passed he would find it difficult to remain a

privatisationAn additional £12.94 million in supporting research was also lostThe United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority said yesterdayGovernment economies on nuclear research means we are having to close an experimental nuclear reactor called Pluto at Harwell next AprilThe research commissioned by the Department of Energy was connected to the reactor and had to be abandonedWe are holding an internal inquiryThe auditors say that the Treasury originally gave the go- ahead in 1982authorising £1.95 million on researchThis was increased to £3.95 million to cover additional safety requirementsAnother £12.94 million was spent on back-up researchThe auditors say the department withdrew support for the project in March after a series of delays in designdevelopmentand preparation for installationof a loop to test the reactorBy that time the ministry had already spent £9.54 million on the projectThe authority said yesterday that the delays arose because the research amounted to

decision to mobilise the army in ambulance dispute Strike-break jibe at ClarkeBy Patrick WintourTHE Health Secretary Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday rejected claims that he was trying to break the ambulancemen's strike when he told MPs he had decided the army would be mobilised to help to answer emergency calls in LondonHe said neither management nor the Government had any other option once the National Union of Public Employees had reimposed the appalling and disgraceful conditions designed to disrupt the accident serviceIn a Commons statementMr Clarke saidWe would very much prefer to see a full accident and emergency service provided by trained ambulancemenbut that is impossible while the unions continue to insist on the 14 conditions which they have imposedI must stress that the involvement of armed forcesthe police and the voluntary services will cease once the trades unions agreeas they did two weeks agoto provide normal accident and emergency serviceMr Nigel Spearing LabNewham North EastshoutedDisgracefulwhen Mr Clarke claimedThe menalthough doing no workare at the moment still in the ambulance stationsIt isin factthe case that the men are pretending to be prepared to operate the accident and emergency serviceThe claim that today's difficulties have been somehow caused by the management is a sick joke being perpetrated by the unionsHe addedThe Government will only use policemen or military personnel to protect the life and limb of citizens at riskThere's absolutely no question of our using either the police force or the army for the purpose of strike-breakingMr Robin CookLabour's health spokesmansaid in every ambulance station in London there were staff ready and waiting to provide emergency coverIn those stations it is the management that has now refused to put through the emergency callsIs it not clear that it is not ambulance staff which have withdrawn the emergency cover from Londonbut the managementHe continuedIn eight weeks of this dispute he Mr Clarkehas not once sat down with the staff side of the ambulancemenWould it not be better to talk to the ambulance staff before he talked to his colleages at the Ministry of DefenceCan the Secretary of State answer the question which has remained unanswered since this dispute began and remains unansweredIf he is so right in offering the ambulance staff 6.5 per centif the ambulance staff are so unreasonable in rejecting itwhat has he got to be so afraid of in going to arbitration which would end this dispute this afternoonInstead of calling in the army why does he not call in the arbitrators and give back London a proper serviceMr Charles Kennedythe Liberal Democrat health spokesmansaid public opinion was clearly behind the ambulancemenThe offer was seen everywhere but inside the Department of Health as an unjust offer in comparison with other emergency servicesIt's a question of political will for him either to encourage arbitration or to make the funds available for a fair settlementMr Jerry Hayes C. Harlowwarned that due to the regrettable and irresponsible behaviour of the unionsone man's pay dispute could soon degenerate into another man's loss of lifeHoweverhe urged the Government to consider taking the ambulance staff's pay permanently outside the political arena by setting up a pay review body for ambulance staff Mr Clarke replied the NHS could not end up in a situation whereby group after group took industrial action and were rewarded by arbitration bodiesThe result would be that the NHS management would be responsible for the pay and conditions of a million peoplebut actually arbitrators would dispose of the resourcesNo cash limit on safetysays ParkinsonBy Paul NettletonMR CECIL Parkinsonthe Transport Secretarygave an assurance to the Commons yesterday that financial considerations would not stand in the way of implementing recommendations of the Clapham disaster reportHe was meeting the British Rail chairmanSir Robert Reidthis morning to discuss prompt implementation of the 93 recommendationsMr Parkinson told MPs that he welcomed the report by Sir Anthony HiddenQCThe investigation has revealed major defects in the way in which British Rail's Southern Region signalling and telecommunications department organised resignalling workand supervised and tested completed wiringHe was asking BR to report within three months on the recommendationsHe said BR would have to consider the spending requiredBut he promisedI can assure the House that finance will not stand in the way of the implementation of the reportThe report had recommended that railway legislation should be reviewedand the powers of the Railway Inspectorate widened and clarifiedWe will introduce the necessary legislation as soon as a suitable opportunity arisesMeanwhilemost of the changes can be implemented by administrative actionMr Parkinson said the report asked the Government to allocate sufficient frequencies for BR to operate cab radios effectivelyWe have now allocated five new frequencies to BR and given them access to two othersThe Health Secretary had accepted recommendations addressed to his departmentand had already introduced a review of the health service's response to major incidentsMr John Prescottthe shadow Transport Secretarysaid the report showed clearly that safety had suffered at the expense of commercial considerationsThis report surely demands a rethink by both the Government and the senior management of BR of the policies that they have adopted over the last 10 yearsMr Prescott asked Mr ParkinsonWill you adopt a new approach to managementinvestment and revenue supportso never again do we see tiredoverworkeddemoralised staff make a fatal error on a darkcold Sunday evening as they rush to finish the work before the Monday morning rush hourHidden calls for cab radiosblack box recordersand research into overcrowding and stronger carriagesSIR Anthony Hidden's report makes 93 recommendations to prevent another such accident and promote a better safety culturein British Railwrites David SharrockAmong them areRigorous standards in wiring and installationOvertime should be monitored to prevent excessive levelsThe Department of Transport and BR should ensure that the cost-effectiveness of safe operation of the railway occupies its proper place in a business-led operationBR should prevent commercial considerations of a business-led railway from compromising safetyOvercrowding should be tackledwith loading criteria establishedBR should give priority to installing cab radios to link driver and signalmanBlack box-style voice recorders should also be introducedTimetable for installation of Automatic Train Protection system should be acceleratedDriver training should emphasise signal failures and their reportingMore research into the ability of carriages to resist major damage in collisionsCommunications with emergency services should be improvedDeclaration of a major incident by any service could then be passed immediately to other servicesThe BR board's Total Quality Management Initiativeadopted in January 1988 to improve working practices and standardsshould be fully implemented with the greatest urgencyThe Government is called upon to ensure that the Railway Inspectorate is adequately staffed and resourced for the increased responsibilities in the wake of the reportIndependent marchers reign on Gorbachev's paradeBy John Rettie in MoscowTHOUSANDS of demonstrators marched through the Moscow streets yesterday calling for an end to the Communist Party's monopoly of powerin the first independent parade to be held on the anniversary of the Russian Revolution since Stalin imposed totalitarian conformity on the Soviet UnionThe greatest holiday in the Soviet calendarNovember 7is the day on which the country is supposed to celebrate its revolutionary leap into a higher form of society socialismBut early yesterdayseveral thousand people with different ideas assembled at the Dynamo Metro stationand began marching towards Red Squarewhere officials were putting the finishing touches to preparations for the usual annual paradeAt a crossroads three miles from the square that for centuries has represented the heart of imperial Russiathe independent marchers were told by police that Red Square was out of boundsA few hundred hotheads urged their comrades to break the police roadblock and march on the Kremlinbut were dissuaded by their leadersInsteadthe demonstrators marched along a route agreed with the authorities to the Olympic Stadiumacross the north of the cityRepresenting a wide spectrum of radical reformers some members of the Communist Partysome members of the Popular Front as well as ecologistsdissident members of the armed forces and religious groupsthey carried banners demanding democracy and a free pressa multi-party system and an end to the Communists' monopoly of powerMeanwhilein the Moldavian republic several people were hurt when nationalists battled with police as growing unrest in the country wrecked some regional celebrations of the RevolutionAlthough there was no sign of him on the Moscow marchmany of the demonstrators chanted support for Mr Boris Yeltsinsacked as Moscow party chief but overwhelmingly elected last March as the city's representative on the new Congress of People's DeputiesDown with the KGBand Down with LigachevYegor Ligachevthe conservatives' leader on the party's politburowere among the milder slogans carried by the demonstratorsOthersreflecting popular frustration with empty shops and official bureaucracy after 72 years of socialismwere harsher72 years on the road to nowheredeclared oneBut perhaps the most bitter was another which readProletariat of all countries SorryIn Mr Gorbachev's Russiaall this is amazingly possibleFor his partthe President stood with the rest of the politburo on the mausoleum of the man who made it all happen Lenin and took the salute at the military and civilian parade through Red SquareUnprecedentedlyhe also gave a television interview from his vantage point as the workers filed by carrying red flagsbanners and coloured balloons which they released into the coldgrey skyThe leader of all the Russias admitted that the country's economic and social crisis amounted to a sword of Damocleshanging over itBut to go back to the old ways would be a colossal mistakehe declaredWe have to advance faster and faster towards new thinkingThe slogans on buildings round the square and carried by workers' groups reflected his new thinkingBack to the idealism of Lenin and 1917was their messageIndeedonly Lenin's face appeared on the square this yearMarx and Engels were missingThe party hardly got a look-inOf the very few banners that mentioned itone from Moscow University called pointedly for a faster rate of democratisation of the partyAs for the military paradeit was even more modest than last yearIn an evident effort to convince the West once again that military might is not what the Soviet Union is all aboutthe imposing array of missilesrocket-launchersself-propelled gunsand armoured vehicles were all long in the toothaccording to a Western diplomatic sourceAll the samethe military parade was the best of the showwith thousands of troops goose-stepping past the mausoleummassed bands marching and counter-marching as they playedbut then drowned out by the roar of armoured hardwareAnd when Red Square echoed and re-echoed to the boom of a 21-gun salute as 800 bandsmen played the national anthemthe ghosts of the Tsars in the Kremlin could have recognised the Russia they lostWhatever Mr Gorbachev's intentionsNovember 7 on Red Square is still the celebration of a great powerTo get the feel of the peopleyou have to go outsideCommentarypage 23Parade cancelledpage 10MONDAY morningDecember 12 1988and another week's commuting was beginning for those heading into London's Waterloo Station from the south-westwrites David SharrockAbout 300 yards from Clapham JunctionBritain's busiest junctionthe 7.18 Basingstoke to Waterloo trainwith more than 900 passengersstoppedDriver Mr Alex McClymont got out to report a faulty signal by telephoneMoments later the 6.14 service from PooleDorsetto Waterloo via Bournemouthcarrying more than 460 peopleploughed into the back of the stationary Basingstoke trainThe impact reduced the front part of the Poole train to twisted metalSome passengers died instantlySeconds later an empty train travelling away from London ran into the wreckageThirty five people were killed113 injuredA thousand lay sprawled in the broken trainsIt was the worst train accident in more than 20 yearsSuddenly there was a big bang and a crashand there was glass everywheresaid a survivor shortly afterwardsPeople seemed to disappear under debrisand we came to a restThen people started shouting and screamingWithin minutes of the crash rescue services were on the sceneSome passers-by did not wait that longleaping off buses and scrambling down the embankment to drag the injured outNearby St George's Hospitalin Tootingreceived the first call at 8.20By 8.30 the hospital was on red alertwith doctors ready in the accident and emergency receiving area and medical teams on the way to the sceneIn the following three hours the hospital took 123 victimsMr Roger Calvertan orthopaedic consultantdescribed the scene of devastationwith severed limbs scattered and passengers still trappedDispassionate is not the word one would useObviously one would not want to see that scene againCrash survivor shuns front coachBy David SharrockONE regular on the early London-bound service counts his survival in the Clapham crash as incredibleThe mana publishing consultantsaidI was in the front coach of the Bournemouth train which took the full impact of the crash and where most of the 35 diedAlthough he had been fortunate to have been sitting at the back of the coach he received a fractured spineI was tremendously lucky that I was not paralysedHe was in hospital for four weeks and had to wear a fibreglass jacket for 16Now he has two metal rods in his backHe recalledThere was an enormous hole rent in the top of the coach right above meso in fact I was got out very quicklyI have a very clear recollection of sitting therenot being able to move and hearing the approaching sirensMy young next door neighbour was sitting directly opposite me and he was completely unharmedHe was holding on to the hand of one of the passengers who was bleeding rather badlyThat particular guy was the first person outthen I was just about the second outIt was desperately silentJust the odd cry for helpThere was a terrible stillnessI have not got back to my normal working routinequite honestlyI didn't start getting back up to London by train until April and even now I am not working as I am used toBut I am up on the train tomorrowI will never travel again in the front coach that is my only superstitious qualmor what ever you want to call itWe all suffered from our hair being absolutely jet-black from the dirt in the carriageThey could not even think of washing my hair until I had had this operation to put the two rods in my backThe counselling by social services had been an enormous helpOne cannot speak too highly of Dorset social servicesWe have had a support group in Bournemouth ever since just after the crashAlthough fewer and fewer are now attending we still meet once a month and we find great strength from discussing problems and traumasMy wife had individual counselling and that was tremendously helpfulBut life would never be the sameI think you do have a totally different approach to life than beforeWhen you have been so close to death and even closer to permanent serious injury then every day becomes a bonusNUT ads aim to boost cash for education *By David Gow Education EditorTHE leadership of the National Union of Teachers yesterday launched a multi-million pound advertising campaign to win public backing for greater investment in educationemergency measures to reduce teacher shortages and to increase salaries in a significant shift of policySupported by an opinion poll revealing extensive support among voters for extra resources for educationunion leaders said the first phase of a prolonged press advertising campaignlaunched in national newspapers todaywould cost £500,000The campaign could last until the next general election and will spread to systematic lobbying of backbench MPsposter hoardings and pressure on ministers and their advisersIt draws on similar campaigns by the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing and is aimed at people in the ABC1 social classThe campaign has been denounced by some leftwing union activists as a diversion from the need for industrial actionHoweverMr Doug McAvoythe NUT's general secretarydismissed them as unrepresentative noisy onesThe NOP polltaken late last month on a sample of 1,000including only 27 per cent of parentsshowed 80 per cent of people already believe an effective education system is the key to economic successMr McAvoy said the first phase was designed to raise that to 100 per centOther findings were that 67 per cent think standards will decline in the next few years if things carry on as they are and that 77 per cent agree teachers do a good job in spite of everythingMr McAvoy saidUltimatelythe campaign's purpose is to persuade the Government to change its existing policy on an issue which will become even more sensitive over the next 12 monthsMr Gordon Greena senior executive membersaid the recent educational changes were doomed to failure unless the Government recognised the true value of teachers implementing them by improving pay and conditionsAn eight-point plan to beat teacher shortages was unveiled yesterday by Mr Jack StrawLabour's education
