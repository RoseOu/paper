gurus reckon that the new package will certainly set shares alight when the stock market opens this morning but there are doubts as to whether it will continue to keep share prices riding highAll the measures proposed by Mr Lamont to pull the UK out of the slump particularly on housingconstructioncars and company tax incentives are bang on target but there is a strong suspicion that the billions he has pumped in may not be quite enoughOne dealer summed it up adequatelyThe Chancellor has delivered cough medicineBut what the patient needs is a strong antibioticThe consensushoweveris that we are moving in the right direction and the further 1% cut in base rates and its knock-on effect on mortgages is the best tonic the country could getThe UK now has the lowest rates in Europe and inflation is rock bottomBut shares have been reflecting the new-found confidence for some timeWhile the Chancellor was delivering his speechprices were heading upwards and the FT-SE 100 was nearing its all-time peak of 2737.8The tight control on public sector pay is crucial and underlines the fact that the Government intends to practise what it preachesMy own opinionhoweveris that now that the returns on bank savings have plummetedinvestors will be searching desperately for new avenues of investment and shares and property will certainly be high on the listThe CBI gave the new moves a warm welcomeIt said that Lamont had responded to many of its suggestions such as improved investment allowances and export credit arrangementsThis will benefit business directlyas will the abolition of the car

slightly upIf you add up all the growth measures it is not terribly excitingAndrew Smitheconomist at Credit Lyonnais saidThe overall market view is that package was in line with expectationsSince the Chancellor is not playing with taxes there isn't much for the consumerHe has confirmed for business that he wants to promote growthThe medium to long term outlook is goodThe package will get the headlines because he has not done anything nastyWhat the money men thought of itTHE measures should be enough to push shares to an all-time highWe now have the lowest rates in Europe and rock bottom

for UK groups is welcome newsAnd Russia isafter allwhere the first English joint-stock companyof the sort whose shares we would recognise on the market todaygot off the groundIt was the Muscovy Companyformed by enterprising English merchants in the year 1554 to trade with the country then ruled by Tzar Ivan the TerribleIt marked the beginning of the London Stock Exchange and an international trading boom for BritainLet's hope this new move has a similar effectAmerican insurers already reckon there is a $40bn about £26bnmarket for foreign investors brave enough to risk their capital in the old Soviet UnionThis neatly matches the region's external debt andsays David Forrest underwriting director of the London-based political risk insurer EIGA we have to encourage investors to give it the ability to earn the foreign exchange to repay that debtBut UK firms will have to be quick off the mark to benefitThe new scheme offered from today by EIGA is open to any European company or EC subsidiary of a foreign firm aiming to build up a Russian business empireThe plan will protect EC-based foreign investors in Russia from political upheavals damaging their businessIt will cover anything from sudden nationalisation to just being deprived of the use of their assetsor a block on repatriating dividendsEIGA reckons its plan will appeal to UK and European businesses ranging from hoteliers trying to set up in Moscow to oil giants eyeing the vast energy resources of KazakhsthanNormally a company buying insurance against political upheavalsnationalisation or blocks on the repatriation of dividendsis required by its insurer to keep this cover a dark secret from the government of the country in questionOtherwise it might decide to nationalise the foreign firm's assets on its soil knowing that the company will just be able to claim the compensation anywayButin a ground-breaking moveEIGA has struck a deal that involves the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development giving companies buying the cover a letter promising not to pounceWhile this does not rule out the risk of a change of regime thereit does cut down the danger of a simple change of heart by the existing governmentAnd that means that the insurance premiums should be cheaper at between 2% and 3% of the capital at risk than the 3%-plus normally charged by private political risk providersEIGA says its plan plugs big gaps in the cover available from EC government agencies for European companies seeking a toe-hold in this potentially attractive and massive new marketAt the

doorstep and this has whipped the cream off doorstep profits and salesIt has also angered Britain's farmers who reckon they are being ripped offThe drama is heightened by the fact that the MMB will

week to a feeling that the economy really is bottoming outat lastsays David Kernchief economist of the National Westminster BankTo date it is a subtle but important change of mood thatwith luckwill grow stronger over the winter allowing spring to bring those green shoots of recovery that the Treasury and the Chancellor have been banging on about for the last two yearsKern's view adds substance to anecdotal evidence from some businesses in the 10 days since the last interest rate cut evidence that suggests the corner is finally in the process of being turnedAnother rate cut would not hurtFor it is a long corner that could take a good three to six months to completeKern warnsHe reckons we are going into it on the last of the downward slope this winterand then will run along on level ground for the first quarter of 1993With the spring we could begin the long slow climb out of the recessionKern thinks the UK economy will go on to grow by 0.7% overall in 1993Others suggest nearer 0.5%while the Chancellor is forecasting 1% growthTentative figures for 1994 pencil in furtherbut modestgrowthFor it will take a while for unemployment to level out and then start fallingTHE weekend's latest realignment of Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism means that Britain can sit back and look smugFor the first time we're a little bit on the sidelines and in some ways this will make the Government's standpoint a bit strongerreckons KernPulling out of the ERM in September and letting the pound float away from the rest of the bunch now looks even smarter than it has in the interim particularly in the light of Sweden's experienceThough not in the ERMits currency was pegged to it and in September Sweden toughed out wild currency markets by whacking its interest rates sky-high for just long enough to scare off the cowboysBut it was not prepared to take the pain of doing it all again and now the krone is floating free in Europe's outer space just like the poundMeanwhileour base rates have come down from 12% they never officially went to the 15% level announced on Black Wednesdayto 7% and should fall furtherWhen depends on the Chancellor and the Treasurywho are still scared of fuelling a rise in inflation while hopingon the other handfor a rise in house pricesSince these two tend to go hand in handanyone whose home is worth less than the mortgage on itwould welcome a little inflationNot to mention a rapid passing on of mortgage cuts to bedraggled flocks of existing homeownerswho are less than thrilled to see the first helping of crumbs go in instant cheap deals to first-time buyersJust because the building societies have a backlog of repossessed homes to flog off does not mean the rest of us should be forced to hang on until January for our rate cutThat is the

owners have been caught in a painful new fixed-interest mortgage trapA massive building society advertising campaign earlier this year has lured them into rates of 10% and 11% but since then the cost of borrowing has plungedand these home owners have come unstuckA lot of new fixed-rate mortgages are now as low as 6–7% and Britain's top lenders are charging those who want to convert to these lower rates enormous opting out feesThe move comes hard on the heels of growing pressure from the Government for banks and building societies to pass on recent rate cuts to home owners to get the economy movingChancellor Norman Lamont is pressing the Bank of England to examine allegations that the big lenders are not fully passing on the cheaper ratesDavid Baugh and his wife of Wrexham are a typical example of the new dilemmaThey have had a mortgage with the Abbey National for four years and recently took up the offer of a fixed rate of 10.99% until 1999They signed their documents but within three weeksthe Abbey launched a new fixed rate of 8.65% until the year 2000They immediately contacted the Abbey's financial adviser at their local branch and asked three basic questions1Could they take advantage of the new offer2Switch the mortgage on buying a new houseand 3. could they leave the Abbey and go elsewhereThe answer to all three questions was Yesbut there was a stingThey had to pay an opting out fee of £1,167.00based on the interest to cover the next seven yearsThe Baughs checked the original offer letter carefully and they say it did not state clearly that once people have acceptedthere was no way out and it certainly did not mention the excessive opt-out figure they were later quotedA spokesman for Abbey saidAll lenders will charge a redemption fee as they have to pay interest on the money borrowedeven if a customer pays off the mortgage during the fixed rate periodAs no one could have foreseen the sharp fall in the base rate after Black Wednesdayit would have been

plunge into home ownershipVATman threatens our budding entrepreneursCathy GunnVAT rules are threatening a valuable scheme that helps people on unemployment and other benefits to get the first foot on the ladder to running their own businessesBut in an eleventh-hour move late on Friday afternoon and just hours after a query about the situation from this column VAT headquarters agreed to consider a new interpretation of the rulesVAT staff playing it by the book were close to destroying the Enterprise Rehearsal schemerun by Barfield Enterprise Training Ltd for Barnet Enterprise Trust and Enfield Enterprise AgencyBarfield feared it would have to close the ER scheme this week ironicallyjust as Hertfordshire was inquiring about joining itSet up in agreement with the Board of Trade and the Department of Social Securitythe ER scheme allows new entrepreneurs to set up in business for three months without losing any state benefitsThis gives them time to see if their idea works or notNearly 300 people have tried it out over the past four years and the success rate is significantly higher than with any other start-your-own-business schemesaid Barfield's joint MD Cliff MaxenCurrently we have 35 on itFor the first three months Barfield is officially the ER businesses' proprietor and holds any surplus funds they generateThus the would-be entrepreneur can keep drawing benefitsandif the business failsthey haven't lost outIf the business is a goerthe entrepreneur moves on to the full Enterprise Allowance system and gets back any surplus fundsBut suddenly the local VATman said that as the money held by Barfield exceeds the VAT thresholdit must pay 17.5% VAT on it even though each business involved would be under the VAT thresholdThe local VATman's refusal to budge clashed directly with the work of Baroness Dentonthe government's small firms minister at the Board of of TradeFormer rally driver Jean Denton is battling to reduce red tape and bureaucratic burdens on small firms and start-upsMaxen wrote to her office seeking help to persuade the VATman to change his mindIt is wonderful to think that someone in a government ministry may be paying attention and trying to help ushe said last nightIt is in no-one's interestnor was it intendedthat the holding company should have to register for VATIt makes the scheme more complicated and less popularWe have stopped taking new people on to itand thought we would have to close it altogetherThe scheme is not out of the woods yetand rather than break the law Maxen last week filled in the local VATman's registration formBut on Friday night news came through that VAT HQ had agreed to study the ER scheme to see if it can be classified as a training activitywhich would be VAT exemptrather than as a business activityMaxen reportedThese matters came to a head in the very week that Baroness Denton launched a £300,000 London Growth Fund to help small firmsThe fund offers cheap loans of up to £5,000at 2% under base rateto
