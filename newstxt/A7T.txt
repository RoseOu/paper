The US sets its compass on two trading oceans NotebookBy Edited by Alex BrummerCANBERRA may seem an awful long way from exchanges on the floor of the House of Commons over the European Monetary SystemBut were it not for the perceived economic might of a more unified Economic Communitythe dozen or so nations of the Pacific Rimwho have been meeting in Australiamight not have botheredThe firstalbeit tenativesteps towards forming a new Pacific-based economic union display an astute awareness of the way events are moving within Europemovements with which Number 10 has yet to come to gripsNot so long ago it seemed as if the world was to divide into three main trading blocksthe EC based around the West German economya Northern American block based around the US-Canadian free trade areaand a Pacific unit incorporating the Asian tigers with Japan and the yen at the centreBut the Metternich-like skills of the US Secretary of StateMr James Bakerare ensuring that America maintains a strong stake in each forumIt firstly boldly asked for a seat at the top table at the European Communitya suggestion rudely rebuffedThe US has talked of a genuine North American free trade zone incorporating the USCanada and Mexico which would have the best of all worlds with high-technology skills and a cheap labour force south of the Rio GrandeNow it is making a third bid for influenceIt has turned up in Canberra with Japan to develop Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation APECand a new 12-nation organisation which will mimic the role of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in EuropePreliminary steps taken to conduct studies on tradetechnology and investment flows in the region may seem insignificantBut Mr Baker plainly views it as otherwiseHe noted that the Canberra meeting is the start of something which could grow into a very significant development not only for the region but for the global economyIf the more economically puny ASEAN countries IndonesiaMalaysiaSingaporeBruneiThailand and the Philippineswere to bury their reservationsthen the high growth from other partnersincluding such tigers as Thailand and South Korea alongside the more mature economies of Japan and Australiacould mean a dynamic coalitionIt would then be up to the US and Canada to decide whether they want to face towards the Atlantic or Pacific or be caught between two great trading oceansHeading for defaultTHE QUESTION of just who would even want to be a partner with the US was underlined last night as the American Administration headed for default for the first time in its historyCongress was frantically trying to complete a bill raising the federal debt ceiling in time for President Bush to sign todayLeaders on Capitol Hill virtually put all other business on hold as it sought to hammer out a debt ceiling increaseThe Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bradya level headed figurewarned that the imbroglio may lead to higher interest costs for the taxpayerWhat should have been a routine exercise in extending the Government's borrowing power to $3.1 thousand billion became bogged down in wrangling over legislative initiatives lawmakers wanted to attach to the billAs a result of the stalematethe Treasury has been forced to postpone $40billion in debt auctions this weekLack of congressional action also forced the Treasury to suspend new sales of US savings bonds and of special securities for state and local governmentsThis market sensitive dispute has taken place as President Bush and Congress continued to spar on a primary cause for government borrowing the budget deficitAt a press conference to mark his election victory a year agoMr Bush threatened to veto the budget unless it contained real cutsOtherwise Congress would have to face the consequences of automatic across-the-board cuts under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction lawAmerica may have changed Presidents a year agobut the fiscal thicket remains as inpenetrable as everPolitical expediencyNO LONGER can the Government disguise the crisis surrounding electricity privatisationMinisters have already had to pull Britain's fleet of Magnox reactors out of the float and delay the sell-off date by up to six monthsBut it has now become clear that further drastic amendments are needed to flotation plansAfter months of turning deaf ears to warnings by the City and industrythe Department of Energy has at last conceded that nuclear plant cannot be included in the share float without state supportThis leaves the Energy SecretaryMr John Wakehamwith two optionshe can either agree to underwrite any cost escalations in nuclear handling costs after privatisationor he can swallow his prideand pull all nuclear plant out of the impending saleWhatever the outcomethe Government's willingness to continue pushing through the float during this Parliament shows how ministers are prepared to put political expediency before the interests of the industryFor the nuclear element in electricity privatisation is the coping stone on which the flotation plans are basedNational Power was given 70 per cent of the CEGB's generating capacity in order to give it an economic mix of powerThe other 30 per cent is to be operated by PowerGenthe other CEGB successor companyTake away or subsidise all nuclear power stations and you lose the commercial logic of the privatisation plansElectricity privatisation needs to go back to the drawing boardAt the very leastthe CEGB should be divided into a wider range of generating companies to stimulate competitionIs it worth sacrificing the long-term future of Britain's biggest state-owned industry to make political capital in the run-up to the next electionHanson puts crucial £21m Morgan stake up for auctionBy Ben LauranceAPIVOTAL £21million stake in besieged merchant bank Morgan Grenfell was yesterday put up for auction by Hanson as talks which could have heralded a Morgan-BZW merger broke downHanson revealed that it had sold 100,000 shares in Morgan but told investors it still owns 4.4million shares in the merchant bankThe announcement was unnecessary under City disclosure rules and bank-watchers immediately interpreted the Hanson statement as an invitation to anyone with designs on Morgan to bid for the stakeMorgan Grenfellonce the high-flyer of British merchant bankingnow finds itself with few British alliesThe Hanson stake is up for saleBanque Indosuez of France already owns more than 10 per cent and wants to buy a further 9.8 per centAnd with the ending of merger talks with BZWit is hard to see how Morgan Grenfell can preserve its independence without falling into the hands of an overseas concernA possible bid could come from West Germany or JapanBZW's decision to break off talks came after a top-level meeting between executives at the investment bank and Morgan yesterdayDiscussions had been taking place since the middle of last weekMorgan has been looking for a white knight for the last two weeks since insurance broker Willis Faber announced it was selling its 20 per cent stake in the merchant bank to Banque Indosuezpart of Compagnie Financiere de SuezWillis Faber is holding back almost half the shares until it receives shareholder backing for the sale at a meeting on November 29If someone wants to make a move on Morganthe would-be predator will have to move before the Willis Faber meetingShares in Morgan edged up 1p to 469p last nightTie Rack looks rather out of fashion as sales slow down OutlookBy Roger CoweTHE good news is that Tie Rack is in better shape than Sock ShopThe bad news is revealed partly by the results for the first half year and partly by the company's prediction that its borrowings will only be down to half shareholders' funds even at the end-of-year low point after the Christmas rushThe hole-in-the-wall tie and scarf retailer is going through a sticky patch in its drive to adorn the world's necksThat is due partly to the sticky summer which saw Englishmen dare to walk open-necked in daylightAlso partly to the time-honoured practice of coming unstuck in the United StatesAnd partly to the general malaise which afflicts the entire retail sector except for Marks and Spencerof courseTie Rack is the ultimate boom stock of the 1980sAn entrepreneurial idea which took offA company launched on the stock market almost exactly at the top of the market in the summer of 1987 and which has gone steadily down ever sinceas the graph illustratesAnd one which found that its ambitious expansion plans were rather more difficult in practice than on paperDetails are sparsewith the company not even revealing interest costs which must be enormousespecially in this slow first half yearBut the picture is one of sluggish sales and high overheadsThe result is a warning from chairman Roy Bishko that full year results will be significantly lowerThere are now 242 shops31 more than at the start of the yearThat increase accounts for the large sales increaseexaggerated by the initial stocks sold to franchisesComparable sales in shops which were open last year were in fact downIn the UKthe company says that was because of the hot weatherand the train dispute which clearly affected traffic past their many shops in railway stationsTie Rack estimates that those factors cost it sales of between £400,000 and £500,000But things have now improved and sales in comparable shops are currently ahead of last yearif only by a neckThe USwhere Tie Rack now has 41 shopshas also been responsible for the first half lossAbout 30 of the shops are now profitableaccording to Mr Bishkobut not profitable enough to cover overheads which are rather higher than he had anticipatedMr Bishko says sales volumes need to rise by a fifth or a quarter for the US operation to break evenand more stores will be needed before it makes a satisfactory profitHe is optimisticnaturallyon the basis of sales growth in the earlier storesbut there will be only one new store in the US this yearIndeed the pace of expansion has slowed to a crawl everywhereeven though much of that expansion in the past has been financed by franchisingThe vast majority of the UK shops are franchisedas are the eight in Scandinavia and the seven in EireFour in Holland and 13 in France have been developed with local partnersleaving 14 Australian and 23 Canadian shops owned by the group as well as the 41 in the USIn retrospect the pace of international expansion may seem extravagantespecially since the franchising route which has eased the financial pain of UK expansion was not thought practicable abroadBut that is all part of the prescription for these go-go and now stop-stop1980s companiesWill Tie Rack come to a full stopProbably noteven though the next couple of years will be tough and even though Mr Bishko has a habit of losing senior managers with an abandon bordering on carelessnessEven at £19.99 for a top-of-the-range silk masterpieceties are not exactly big ticket itemsAnd while at least in my personal experiencemen are more likely than women to stop buying such adornments when times are toughgravy and similar substances will keep going astraycreating a steady replacement marketIt would be interesting to know how Mr Bishko's shareholders feel about the futureBut since half the shares are owned by the shadowySouth African-linked Vadep Holdings we and even Mr Bishkoare unlikely to find outAlthough with no dividend increase and the shares languishing at just 46p after yesterday's falleven the patience of anonymous South Africans must be sorely testedWall Street hit by job fears as Shearson cuts 800 staffBy Mary Brasier in New YorkSHEARSON Lehmanthe securities househas sparked fears of a fresh wave of job cuts on Wall Street with a decision to make up to 800 employees redundantThe cuts are the third time Shearson has laid off staff since the market crash of 1987and are the highest on Wall Street this yearThey are expected to fall across the board among the firm's 38,500 employees but will be confined to New YorkA spokesman for Shearson said UK staff would not be affected and the group is not withdrawing from any area of businessShearson yesterday blamed the continued slowdown in market activity and excess capacity for the redundanciesThe market plunge on October 13 when the Dow Jones index fell 190 points was a factorsaid spokesman Steven FaganBut Shearson like other Wall Street firms has been forced to review its payroll by the dearth of corporate finance fees on top of the chronic decline in market volume and commissionsThe cuts will remove another two per cent from the payroll following layoffs of 1200 last year and a further round which saw 300 jobs goAfter Black Mondaylarge firms like Shearson have built up their corporate finance departments and relied increasingly on them to generate earningsBut the collapse of the United Airlines bid and the troubles of the junk bond market have blocked new dealsThe main axe is expected to fall on the firm's back office operations and among administrative staff in an effort to contain expensesAnalysts say that Shearson is paying the price for overmanning

suspended dealings in its fundsworth £33 millionafter the disclosure that there may have been pricing errors in recent valuationsThis is the first time a unit trust company has had to suspend funds under the Financial Services Act's pricing regulationswhich oblige it to cease trading once an error is suspectedIt means Dumenil's 12,000 investors are locked into their investments until the investigation is completeAs the suspension of a unit trust over a pricing error is unprecedentedit is not known when units can be traded againOne month has been suggested as a possible suspension periodDumenilwhich specialises in single country European fundsclaims it became concerned very recentlythat its valuations on two funds in particular were out-of-line with general movements in the marketThe marketing directorNigel HerricksaidThe market would fallbut our prices would not show a corresponding movementUnit trust industry sources claim that rumours began circulating as long as three months ago that Dumenil had a problem with valuationsThe company stresses the problem has been very short-livedBut as a precaution it has suspended all its fundsuntil an investigation pinpoints the root of the problemUnit trust prices are calculated on computers using market information supplied by the WM CompanyThere is no suggestion that the WM data has been faultyMr Herrick saidThis is an in-house problemRight now we do not know the extent of that problemWe do not know whichif anyfunds are affected and we do not know whether there has been an over valuation or an under valuationDumenil has called in Touche Ross as independent accountants to assess the scale of the problemThe regulatory bodiesincluding the Securities and Investments Boardthe Investment Managers Regulatory Organisation and the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation are keeping a close eye on the investigation procedureIf it is proved that unit holders who have traded units recently have suffered as a result of pricing errorssome form of compensation will be made availableMidland Bankone of the trustees of the Dumenil fundsstepped in to calm investors' fearsA Midland spokesman saidThe assets of the trust have been and continue to be under the control of the trustee whose objective remains that of insuring that the interests of the investors are protectedThe aftershocks of the European row tell us that the big tremors are still to come EconomicsBy Christopher HuhneWHATEVER the hopes of the Conservative party's managersthe divisions over European policy are not going to go awayThere is boundsooner or laterto be a battle royal over membership of the European Monetary Systemthe result of which will be either an almost unprecedented humiliation for Mrs Thatcher or the reshaping yet again of a Cabinet in her own imageOn present bettingthere is a fair chance the pound will finally join the system by the end of next yearMrs Thatcher interprets the Madrid formula more as a pretext for not joining the EMS than as a set of three conditions for joining itMoreovershe has been advised by Sir Alan Walters thatonce exchange controls have finally been removed by France and Italy in July 1990the new freedom of capital flows will break the fixed exchange rate system apartOn that fond hopeshe is likely to be disappointedThe remaining controlsmainly affecting restrictions on bank depositsare smallAt some point in the second half of next yearand perhaps even earlier if President Mitterrand decides to bring forward the abolition of French controlsthe Government is going to be faced with an inescapable decisionControls will have goneBritish inflation will be down an odd conditionsince one reason for the system is to help reduce inflationThere will have been progress on the creation of a single European marketespecially in financial servicesReasonable people will decide that each of the Madrid conditions has been metAt that stagethe pressures for full membership are bound to mount at home and overseasThe pound may now stay at its new post-Lawson level or even decline furtherBut at an exchange rate ofsayDM2.70 instead of the present DM2.90the trade-offs for the new Chancellor will begin to look differentHe will want to avoid a further decline for fear that import price rises will push up inflationFor good electoral reasonsEMS membership will look an increasingly attractive alternative to a tighter monetary policyThe going will be tough enough as it isThe former ChancellorMr Lawsongave a foretaste of the Treasury's Autumn Statement forecast whenin his resignation speechhe pointed out that we are once again on the downswing and I see no need for any further policy tighteningWhile this downswing will not be as sharp as the previous downturn in 1979-81not least given the very much lower level of inflation that we now havea dull 1989 is bound to be followed by a difficult 1990The downturn will notthoughundermine the case for EMS membershipA mild recession will correct but not eliminate the deficitwhich is bound to remain highand may even rise again as another pre-election consumer spree gathers paceOutside the EMSthe markets would become worried once again about the Government's real commitment to exchange rate stabilityThey would insist on inflationary falls in the poundor a deflationary tightening of monetary policyWhat better than EMS membership to reassure themThe external pressures for EMS membership will also mountIt will become increasingly clear that Britain is paying a high political price for its refusal to participate in the EMSnot least in the almost immediate reflex reaction against any British proposals to affect the design of a future monetary unionNo one watching the French reaction to the unfolding events in central Europe should doubt the political importance which the Elysee attaches to monetary union as a way of anchoring west Germany to this end of the ContinentA single currency is also on the agenda because the balance of the economic argument has also swung sharply in its favour over the last decadeas Professor Michael Artis has pointed out 1He guesstimates that the existence of different European currencies cost about 1.5 per cent of Europe's total income each yearmerely in terms of the losses incurred by traders and investors when they change currenciesEven more importantthe prospect of a single currency would eliminate an ormous source of uncertainty for businessesIt would probably unleash another burst of investment as firms took advantage of opportunities which had hitherto been regarded as too riskyAfter allbusinesses can insure against the exchange rate risk on particular deals for exampletheir exports to France by accepting less sterling today in exchange for the known future quantity of francsBut they cannot hedge investments in the same way even if the markets looked far beyond a year or sowhich they do notAssumefor examplethat Jaguar had insured itself against a fall of the dollar by covering several years of earningsThe fall of the dollar would still mean that every Jaguar car sold in the US was less profitablealthough the company might have made lots of money on its foreign exchange transactionsThe rational company would cash in its profits on the speculation and still cut production and investment as it was priced out of the US marketExchange rate uncertainty is thus bound to reduce investmentSome idea of the potential gains from a single currency can be had by looking at previous historical periods when people really believed that exchange rates were fixedMr Tam Bayoumi has calculated the average size of capital flows each year in the major economies under the Gold Standard from 1880 to 1913and has shown that they were much larger than during the post-war period from 1965 to 1986Indeedthe average flowas a percentage of GDPfor eight countries in the sample before 1914 was 3.25 per cent a yearthe average flow for ten countries post-1965 was only 1 per cent2The advocates of the Government's competing currenciesapproach suggest that many of these gains would occur by merely moving to a hardEMS in which currencies became progressively more fixed 3Howeverthe evidence so far suggests that it is not enough to persuade businesspeople that rates will really be fixed foreverMoreoverthe process of establishing credibility is long drawn outThe Frenchdespite an exceptionally tough policystill have interest rates above the German level because they are unable to persuade the markets they mean what they say when they rule out a devaluationNor is it sensible to argueas the Treasury hasthat a European system of central banks in charge of a single currency might prove more inflationary than a fixed exchange rate system where each monetary authority competed to provide a stable benchmark of valueIt is impossible to make any such comparison without knowing what the institutional arrangements of the system would beIf the system's charter allowed for a bank governor to be shot at dawn for every month the inflation rate exceeded 1 per centit might prove even more counter-inflationary than the BundesbankThe potential political and economic gains ensure that the impetus towards a currency union in Europe is likely to prove much stronger today than it did in the turbulent SeventiesAnd thatin turnis likely to feed back on the Government in the form of pressures from the most irresistible of all Tory constituenciesthe CityAfter allwhat would be more likely to gain from a brave new world of free capital flows than the greatest financial centre in EuropeThis week has not seen the end of the row about Europe in the Conservative partybut merely a regrouping of forces for the battle still to

stakes in the Cabinet row over Europe last night when he said the UK should join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System within the next few monthsIn a thinly disguised attack on the Prime Minister and her former adviser Professor Sir Alan WaltersSir Leon said the countries which had become full members of the exchange rate mechanism had enjoyed lower interest rates and lower inflationIt really is a bit strange to have been arguing the merits of ERM membership in academic abstractionwhen the practical effects are there for all to seeAcademicslike accountantsshould be on tapand not on topIn a step-by-step assault on the softly-softly approach to Europe being peddled by Downing Streetthe former Conservative cabinet minister also made it clear that Mrs Thatcher's hard-line opposition to the concept of monetary union with the other 11 EC nations was jeopardising the chances of London becoming the base for a European central bankI see no reasons for us to shy away from the concept of a Federal Reserve-type of European Central Bankoperating as in the United States on a decentralised basisSir Leon said in a lecture in LondonIf it were based in Londonwhich as Europe's financial powerhouse would be a natural home for itthe benefits to the City would be enormousBut there willof coursebe no chance of that happening unless Britain were to show its enthusiasm for the project from the outsetSir Leon dismissed arguments that a pan-European central bank would mean the United Kingdom would have to surrender sovereignty and relinquish control over monetary policyCommenting on the increase in UK base rates to 15 per cent last monthhe addedWhat sort of expression of sovereignty is it to have to race after the Bundesbank within minutes of its unilaterally deciding to put up interest ratesWouldn't we have more control over our affairs if the Bank of England had a major say in what happenedas part of a decentralised European banking authoritySir Leon said there was no need for the United Kingdom to wait for its inflation rate to reach the European average before joining the exchange rate mechanismnor to hold back until the further removal of capital and exchange controls next summerJoining the ERM is not a prize to be given to our partners when they come up to scratchbut a benefit to ourselves if only we would take ithe saidHopes rise for European compromise deal on greater telecoms competitionBy John Palmer and Peter LargeOUTLINES of a compromise deal to open Europe's telecoms industry to greater competition emerged in Brussels last night after a day-long meeting of EC industry ministersEarlier yesterdaythe UK telecoms authority Oftel announced it was launching an inquiry into how effective competition had been in improving Britain's phone servicesAlthough any European agreement will not be reached before next monthit looks as though the Commission may be winning its battle to eliminate national protectionismEight of the 12 EC governments remain opposed to attempts by the EC Commissioner for competition policySir Leon Brittanto impose greater competition on national telecoms authoritiesBut they agreed with a proposal from the French Governmentwhich is currently responsible for the EC Council of Ministersto discuss an amendment which would allow the Commission to grant temporary exemptions to countries facing problems with liberalisationThe Commission aims to open up the £60billion telecoms industry as part of the 1992 single European marketThe strategy has been to abolish national protectionism in the sales of terminal equipmentto lay down one set of technical standards throughout the ECto separate the regulatory and business sides of the telecoms authoritiesand to open public purchasing of equipment to pan-European tenderThe British Industry MinisterMr Eric Forthsaid last night that the Commission's latest proposals were a well balanced attempt to allay the fears of some delegations about the consequences of liberalisation for their national suppliersMeanwhilein ParisGPTthe £1.8billion quasi-British telecoms combinewas launching a company to exploit the liberalisation of the French marketLast year the trade in telecoms equipment between Britain and France barely reached £20millionbut today GPT alone has short-list bids for £18million of French public contractsThe new subsidiaryGPTelecomis headed by Rupert Soamesson of the former British Ambassador to France and EC vice-presidentMr Soames said that whatever the state of liberalisation elsewhere in Europethe French market was moving at a pheneomenal rateGPT was formed to unite the telecoms businesses of GEC and Plesseybut as a result of the Plessey takeover it is now owned 60 per cent by GEC and 40 per cent by the German groupSiemensSiemens products for communications networks will be sold in France through GPTelecomand Mr Soames said the agreement was likely to be widened so that all telecoms products of Siemens and GPT would be marketed in France through the single channelThe new look at the effectiveness of British liberalisation was announced by Sir Bryan Carsberghead of Oftelat the annual meeting of the Telecoms Users' AssociationHe said that after 3 ½ years of competition between British Telecom and the Cable and Wireless subsidiaryMercury Communicationsit was time to survey customers' experience andif necessaryidentify practices which might still be inhibiting competitionHe needed to be sure that current arrangements were working as well as possible before the Government's review next year of whether competition in basic telecoms should be extended beyond the two companiesSir Bryan said he had received some indicationsthat BT's position as a designated maintainer of company phone exchanges could inhibit progress for prospective Mercury customersHe was also considering whether the code of practice which governs the quality of connections between private lines and the public phone network should be advisory rather than mandatoryIt seems to me to be inconsistent with the spirit of liberalisation to have a mandatory code that necessitates a cumbersome and bureaucratic certification processBAT drops its French bankersBy Financial staffTHE tobacco-to-insurance giantBAT Industriesyesterday sacked one of its big bankersParibasafter the French finance

Perrier's soft drinks businesswhich includes Pchitt lemonadeBali syrupand the bottling of Gigi lemonadeCadburywhich declined to comment on speculationrecently acquired the Gigi brand name when it bought Crush from Procter&Gamblebut it is understood it would be reluctant to pay much more than £150million for the Perrier businessAn extra impetus for the disposal came at the start of the week when Pepsi decided to end its franchise relationship with Perrierciting poor sales performanceSome interpreted Pepsi's decision as a prelude to a bid for Perrier's soft drinks businesswhich analysts predicted might also attract offers from Coca-ColaSuntory of Japanor Guinness through its LVMH connectionMarcel RichardPerrier's financial directordeclined to mention the impact of Pepsi's decisionBut it is understood that Pepsi's market share in France for cola drinks dropped from 18 per cent in the early 1980s to roughly 10 per cent despite an expanding marketFor Perrier the sale of soft drinks have become vastly less important than the revenue from bottled waterSoft drink sales last year were £115millionless than a tenth of the group's revenueMuch of the upheaval in the world's soft drinks

was passed to the Observer newspaper was leaked by officers of the Metropolitan Police fraud squadit was alleged yesterdayAccording to a House of Commons motionthe leak was traced through a system of numbered copies of the 752-page documentwhich was sent out to the authorities investigating possible criminal proceedings resulting from the report's conclusionsMr Dale Campbell-SavoursLabour MP for Workingtonclaims that the leak inquirywhich followed publication of parts of the report in a special edition of the Observerdiscovered that copy 26 had been sent to the paper's ownersLonrhoIt is the first time the fraud squad has been directly accused of leaking the reportThe MP's motion and three parliamentary questions directed at the Attorney-GeneralSir Patrick Mayhewallege the copy was given to the fraud squad to help its investigations into the successful £615million bid for Fraser by the Fayed brothers in 1985Two fraud squad officersDetective Inspector Graham Gooch and Detective Sergeant Ken Morganwere sent out to Egypt as part of the investigation being conducted alongside an investigation by the Serious Fraud OfficeHoweverthey were later taken off the case and transferred to other dutiesMr Campbell-Savours alleges that senior Scotland Yard officers then decided the team should not have any further contact with the Observer or LonrhoBut his motion addsThis House therefore questions why an officer chose to ignore that instruction by meeting the City editor of the Observer at least twice including on the eve of publication of the special editionThe motion goes on to say that it draws the natural and disturbing inferencethat the meetings and copy number 26 were linkedAnd Mr Campbell-Savours called on the Lonrho chief executiveMr Tiny Rowlandto relinquish control over the ObserverThe questionslisted for today in the Commons order paperask whether the fraud squad had the copyif any disciplinary action had been taken against any officer and whether criminal inquiries are being pursuedThe SFO refused comment on the MP's allegations or on when it will decide if any prosecutions should follow from the Fraser takeoverHowevera decision is believed to be imminient and reports suggest the SFO will take no further actionThis would allow the report to be published as the Government has promisedA Scotland Yard spokesman said no disciplinary action had been taken against any officers and that nobody had been suspendedHe said Scotland Yard could not pre-empt any Commons questions until they had been answeredMr Campbell-Savours last night withdrew his questions on procedural grounds but said he will retable themThe Attorney General's office saidThey will be answered by the appropriate ministerPublication of the report by the Observer in March this year caused a furore and prompted a special committee of Law Lords to decide whether Lonrho had been guilty of contempt of court before its appeal to the House of Lords on the Fraser bidThey concluded the companywhich has bitterly contested the Fayeds ownership of the stores grouphad taken the law into own handsbut cleared it of contemptLonrho last night reiterated its claim that it had received the copy of the report in a brown paper envelopeWe have no knowledge of where it came fromsaid a spokesman
