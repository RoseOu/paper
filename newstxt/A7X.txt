When the pie was opened Letter from LakelandBy David BeanNOVEMBER againThe shrinking of daylightthe burgeoning triumph of black Chaos and nightAnd hereaboutsof coursetime once more for the consumption of the traditional Boggerthwaite November Owl PieNo one any longer recalls where this unusual dish had its originsindeed some people have been unkind enough to suggest that it was but recently invented by Mr Rory McGurk at the Dehydrated Rambleron finding himself with too much ageing shepherd's pie left on his handsIt provedeven at the insolent price of Â£5.95 a sliceto be even more popular than McGurk's other stock-in-tradethe Jumbo-Cumbo Boggerburgerand he has prepared a batch every November sinceSo few of us were surprised when the other evening three strangers entered the Saddle Bar and ordered portions of the stuffThat they were visiting shootists seemed pretty evident from the way they left the bar door open against the howling nightthe loudness of their speechand the muddy state of their bootsHikers are generally timid enough to leave their footwear and rucksacks in the porchtoday's sporting fraternity always brings its mud with it as well as milling packs of steaming black labradorsI do not know where they get these dogsThey must hire themfor they are clearly not countrymen these daysThey talk not of rural matters except of the possibilities of old barn conversionsbut of stockssharesinvestmentsand insuranceThey fail entirely to distribute largesse to the locals and leave the door open again on their loud departuresI have gone into this rather lengthy description for two reasonsonebecause it leads back into the folklore of the November Owl Pieand twobecause I can't stand the blighters at any priceThe Pie thenWhat's thislandlordThe leader of the trioan ample-bellied type with a tweed cap and one of those quilted waistcoats which look like half-inflated life jacketssniffed the air as he studied the blackboard which serves the Rambler as a menuNovember Oil PieOwlcorrected McGurkSirThe stranger turned and raised an inquiring brow at his brethrenwho noddedBrace-and-a-half of thatthenlandlordAnd when McGurk appeared to hesitateThat's threeA quarter-of-a-dozen owl pies coming upreturned McGurkThat's three as wellThe dishes he filled seemed indistinguishable to my eye from run-of-the-mill cottage pie except they were rather blacker round the edges than is normaland they were accompanied by the garnish of a quarter of a raw tomatotwo cucumber slicesa sprinkling of cress or maybe lawn clippingsand a tiredpre-chewed lettuce leaf without which no British pub meal is complete these daysMy first suspicion that these chaps were not what they seemed was aroused as I listenedTheir chat was not of high finance or propertyIt was in fact non-existentThey just chompedand when they had finishedthe podgy leader rose and quietly asked McGurk if there was somewhere they could talk to him in privateWe would have only McGurk's word for what happened subsequently if I had not positioned my ear by the keyhole of his officeThere was a little humming and hah-ing and Nowgentlemen-ingfrom McGurkThen the leader introduced himself as an inspector from the Department of Healthand his colleague as from Trade and IndustryThe thirdin a voice like a cross buzzard'ssaid he was from the Royal Society for the Protection of BirdsIt was not easy to hear all that followedbut a right old tangle developedInspectorWas that really owlMcGurkIn a manner of speakingsirnoInspectorI must warn that you may be liable under the Trades Descriptions ActRSPB manIt tasted like owlSecond InspectorIf it was described as Novemberwhat did that mean cooked in Novemberfrozen in Novemberre-heated in Novemberto be eaten in Novemberor whatWhicheverI have to warn that the use of the names of the months in describing food is no longer permitted by EEC regulationsMcGurkWhat about Christmas puddingthenInspectorSarcasm will get you nowhereWe are working on that one
