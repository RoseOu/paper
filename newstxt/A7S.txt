MessiaenPierre Boulez and John Cage are coming to the Yorkshire town for the annual Contemporary Music FestivalBritain's highlight in the world of electro-acoustic chords and allied disharmonyThe six

contemporary music is not a popular art form and electro-acoustic music is particularly unpopulareven among contemporary musiciansadmits Robert Worbyone of two composers helping the Fartown team with their own three-minute pieceThe three celebrated composers visiting Huddersfield are all in their seventiesThey and their colleagues are particularly eager to generate interest among the youngThe humorousself-mocking twist to much contemporary music is helpingaccording to Sam & CoHardthey sayto be too overawed by a character like Cagewhose music includes Roaratorios and a piece composed solely for the white keys on the pianoNot to mention his composition Four Minutes 33 Secondstechnically described as a period of apparent silencePerformed in Fartown's Portakabin classroomwhere 14-year-old Sam and his team are workingthis would consist largely of the rhythmic hum of Kirklees education department's antiquated wall-heaters and 13-year-old Nicola Bradford's occasional sneezePerhaps those are sounds you could use in your own compositionspeculates the school's head of musicPaul Chamberlainwhose quest for strange noises has led to the possibility of him poaching the National Curriculum's

at Paul Hill's remembrance of beatings pastwhen he could hear the sound of steel-tipped boots running to take part in the funand once heard a principal medical officerno lesstelling colleaguesDon't walk his facedon't walk his faceNot even the time he was dunked head first in a tub of dubious liquidand brought up gasping for breathMake him sing God Save the Queenthey shoutedBrutalityas Hill describes and felt itwas a bitter part of his prison lifeyou just learnt to get down on the floor as fast as you could and cover up as best you couldBut it was Gerry Conlon's account of being interrogated after the Guildford bombings that made the scalp crawlWe know your mother works at the Royal Victoria Hospitalthey told himwe know where your sister worksand there are sectarian killings down thereThey told me they could arrange an accidentAnd I believed they were capable of murdering my motherI honestly believe they would have murdered my mother that's why I signed the statementThe account he gave just after his release was that the threat had been that a British soldier might accidentallyshoot one of the womenA few months ago eventhis would have seemed improbableYou might have assumed this was the police bluffing and bullyingYet given what we have learned about links between the security services and the Loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Irelandand the deep suspicion about surrogate murdersyou can't shrug off the shiver Conlon's words bringThere were daunting moments in last night's First Tuesday Yorkshirebut few of them matched that hint of a jackboot under the blue sergeIt's right that the Guildford Four have told their stories now to Grant McKee and Ros Franey and First Tuesdaythe programme and the producers who dug awayand did much to keep the case aliveAnd they told it without on-screen questioningthough the programme is skilfully structured to give it a coherence it might have lackedCarole Richardson's is the most haunting faceYou have to hope that its blankness will slowly dissolve and let life inJust once a couple of tears rolled downIt was when she described seeing film of the results of the bombing on televisionand thinkingThey think I did thatArmstrong seems the least permanently damaged on the surfaceHe pays tribute to his treatment at Gartree prisonhe apologises to the bomb victims' families that they have had to keep reminding them of their lossBut we had to fight for our freedomHill expresses the way time has cheated themhis daughter was born while he was remanded in custodyand is now 14She would change dramatically and I didn't feel a change in myself mentallyI'm still 20 in my headNothing's happened to meI haven't livedBut again it was Conlonthe slightly wild-eyed Irish poet of the quartetarticulateflamboyant remember that extraordinary exit through the front door of the Old Bailey who cut deep into the collective conscienceHe described being taken over the years to see his sickand finally dying and almost certainly innocent father in another prisonHe was convicted with the Maguires in the parallel case of a bomb factoryAnd he tells how none of the assembled guards and officials could look his father in the eye as he protested his innocenceOnly the nurses could do thatAnd at the endConlon drew the one hopeful conclusionIf this stops capital punishment ever coming backthe time I've spent in prison will be well worth itIf this stops another innocent person going to prisonit'll be well worth itI've had numerous prison governors say to meYesConlonwe know you're innocentbut there's nothing we can

arts QEHBy Meirion Bowen Ligeti FestivalWHETHER writing new pieces or extending old onesLigeti comes across almost like Birtwistle as a convergent musical thinkerIf all his mature compositions were laid end to end and glued togetherthey might well form one big workThis unitary vision was particularly well-exemplified in the finalfour-hour concert in the Ligeti Festival at the QEHwhich featured the premieres of two further piano etudes and of the five-movement version of his Piano ConcertoThe first six etudescompleted in 1985were stimulated by Ligeti's studies of rhythm in sub-Saharan music and the multi-layered polyrhythms in the pianola works of Conlon Nancarrowand the two new ones drew partly on ideas from gamelan musicBut all thisalong with his fascination with rhythmic displacements in Chopin and othersdisappeared within a distinctively Ligetian interplay of line and colourIt required from the pianist an unbelievable independence of hands and fingersso that unevenly spread accents and criss-crossing figurations appeared to drop into place without obvious effortVolker Banfield here achieved all that was demanded of him technicallyBut his playing was studiously uncommunicative and prosaicunresponsive to the poetry behind the notes e.g. in the cool Bartokian chords that closed the eighth studyIn the Piano Concerto it wasof coursean asset to have a soloist who could keep his head amid all the intricate polymetrical pulsations of the first and third movementsBanfield extracted little dramahoweverfrom the exchanges between the piano and different orchestral groups in the fourth and fifth movementsIn his handsthe work became a latterday baroque concerto grossowith the pianist as one soloist among manywhereas the range of invention and harmonic emphasis in the work implied a far more provocative interaction of rolesWhile the concerto had sounded complete and satisfying in its original three-movement formatthe additional movements opened up new horizons and changed its structural proportions without distorting any of its existing perspectivesIf anythingits additional colours brought extra glitter to the musicand this quality was certainly seized upon by the London Sinfonietta under Elgar Howarthwho eagerly compensated for the pianist's lack of a trenchant or subtle deliveryReserve and reticence of expressionon the part of solo cellist Christopher van Kampen and the Sinfoniettawere more aptly applied in the context of Ligeti's Cello Concerto 1965a sparsely-writtenlapidaric work that discloses the absolute minimum within its unbroken span of 26 kaleidoscopic episodesThis work made an effective bridge to the equally spare and fastidious Four Capriccios Opus 9 by Gyorgy Kurtag whose music Ligeti has generously welcomed into his Festivaljust as he insisted on having the composer share the stage at the endKurtag is Ligeti's opposite a divergent musical thinker whose every new work might be by another composerwere it not for the extreme compression that is constant to his styleIn the settings of four aphoristic poems by Istvan Balint for soprano and 14 players which Kurtag began in 1972 and recently revised the outside influences declared themselves quite readilywhether they were from East European folk music or Webernand in this performancethe soprano Adrienne Csengery and Sinfonietta excelled themselves with sudden flashes of colour and bursts of intense virtuosityMan in the MoonBy Paul Fisher IronmistressIRONMISTRESS uses heavy metallic imagery to tell of Martha Darbya character based on a real 19th century widow who

Feminist fans may be outraged by her apparent change of imagebut it's no sell-outas Michelle Shocked tells Lucy O'BrienTHE recent release of Michelle Shocked's single On The Greener Side has sent seismic reverberations throughout the music industryShe appears in the video wearing a lime green mini-dresssurrounded by impassive Schwarzenegger beefcake types in dinner suitsher face fully made upher mouth gleaming with bright red lipstickFrom the gal who swore she'd rather be dragged across a plain by wild horses than wear lipglossthis comes as something of a surpriseIt's not so much a reconstruction of image as proof that Shocked's confidence is growingInstead of being terrified of commercial mainstream popshe's now manipulating its stereotypesThe video is actually a parody of Robert Palmerthe slithering lounge lizard of pop who four years ago thought it cool to cast his videos with countless women dressed exactly the sameacting like mass-produced mannequinsIntuitively I know that's as misogynist as it getssays ShockedShe also knows that the media tendency to lump together women singer-songwriters in a gee whizgoshwomen are now making itsyndrome is patronisingif not perniciousThey may as well call it Women who don't wear make-upshe chucklesIt's less threatening for men to lump women together and deal with them as onerather than pointing out the differencesShocked has taken a brave stepAlthough she turns up for the interview her customary peaked-capped urchin selfshe is worried that her feminist interpreters will consider her video a sell-outIf I soften the edges whether I need to personally or whether it's being imposed on me I feel I'll be letting down the revolutionWhoever dictated thisThis is pure projection on my partAt one time I was a nihilistic punk with a mohican and a ring in my noseI think in the course of time I'll find a middle If I soften the edges whether I need to personally or whether it's being imposed on me I feel I'll be letting down the feminist revolutiongroundbut I also carry that sense of responsibilityI'm in a position to defeat stereotypesto work for the greater good for women who don't enjoy the privileges that I haveFar from letting down the sideShocked is projecting a freshly combative imageHer humour is a weapon that has pole-vaulted her out of the solid folk-roots categoryan alternative scene that would have kept her firmly away from the mainstreamMusicallytooshe's been striding into new territorycelebrating all kinds of Forties swing on her latest LPCaptain SwingWith its loudluscious harmoniesraunchy guitar and full brass bandthe record is commercial country blues peppered with lyrical bons mots and that female troubadour sensibilityThe music warrants being filled outShocked saysIt's about tension and relaxationthe interaction between musiciansSpeaking in a slightly formal Texan liltShocked exudes a quiet charisma and wry stubbornnessWhen under pressurethoughshe is said to throw tantrumsto distance herself from those around her and just take offInside Michelle Shocked there is a fierce lonerNow 26she spent many years after college hitchhiking around the worlddrifting through the punk scene in San Francisco to demonstrations in Dallassquats in Amsterdam and the women's peace camp in CosmoItalybefore a British producer recognised her itinerant musical talent and signed her up with the bestselling Texas Campfire Tapes LPIs Shocked still a wandererI've put it on the back burnerbut have never given up the long-term goal of going round the world by sailboatWhen you hear about these floating islands of garbage in the Pacificit makes it a little less appealingbut it feels like the sea is the only wilderness leftOnce you lose sight of landyou may as well be in spaceShocked is making plans to sail with her fatherwho long ago began building a boatuntil marriage and fatherhood distracted him from finishing itShe is pleased at the rewarding relationship she has with himthough it's something she has had to fight to keepA young child when her parents divorcedshe regained contact with him at 16after she left her motherShe hasn't spoken to her sinceShe threw me outIt was very hard for meI was brought up in GilmerTexasas a fundamentalist MormonIt was a closed community with the habit of passing down ultimatums for exampleyou were created to be a wife and motherI'm never getting marriedso where does that leave meThere was no place for meMy mother believed that if she was gonna get to heavenI had to marryWhat kinda religion is it that would encourage the parent to shelter the child from any outside influences and punish it by putting it out in a world you never had any way of learning aboutShocked's reponse was to learnand fastShe put herself through many risky experiences on the roadalong with some vigorous political activityHer lifelong mission has been to counter fundamentalist hypocrisy in any formbut she admits she'd now like to resolve the conflict with her motherShe must be going through a lotta pain tooShocked looks glumly at the tableanxious to put her past behind heryet concerned to put things rightIt's as if she's deadshe says quietlyThen she perks upI find it interesting that there's this whole small town that claims methat I want nothing to do withIt's my revenge fantasy One day they'll be sorryShocked is coming to terms with her loss her own wayAfter protecting herself during her travelling years by dressing like a boyshe is temporarily hanging up her hat and exploring her sensualfeminine sideHence
