the way Lighten up BrooksideCoronation Street and EldoradoPETER GRANT pleas to our soap writersCan we have a laughpleaseSTOP all your moaningMURDERlove affairsviolencerobberiesmounting debtsour soap operas are packed full of every gloomy scenario that surrounds us in the real worldBut there's one thing blatantly missing in the majority of our top telly dramas the ability to laugh at ourselves and some of our predicamentsGrantedlife's not a continual merry-go-roundbut it's also not all bleakness eitherYet our soaps are top of the ratings but they could increase their viewers even more if they eased-up a little and balanced things outIt's not all doomgloom and despondency in lifeeven when things are going wrong we all need to laughAnd laughter is infectiousso a little bit of effort on the small screen could start the ball rollingThe scriptwriters should take note of our FUN FORTNIGHT include a few more comical characters who can lighten up and shake off all these severe scenariosTop of the Fun Fortnight favourites is Coronation Street 17.4 millionwith Mavis and Derek WiltonThe dithering duo are now so popular that Mavis's catch-phrase I don't really knowis the first choice of telly impressionistsToo heavy And then there's Vera and Jack Duckworth their barmy battles always make for a Punch and Judy-styled double actUnfortunatelyReg Holdsworth is getting a bit too romantic the bespectacled romeo should get back to his impisheccentric waysBrookside 7 millionis so seeped in worthy but heavy storylines that there is a definite need for a few lighter momentsMerseysidehost of the Festival of Comedy and birthplace of so many comedians and top sitcomsis a naturally funny place so where are the Brookie bluffersthe wise-cracking wagsGive Sinbad a better break is the answer he's one of the most endearing soap characters on the boxyet now he's fast turning into a busybodyGone are the happy days when Barry and Terry were verbal sparring partnersNow they are simply sinister to each otherWe need another Harry Cross and Ralph to present a silver lining to the ever present cloud of worthwhile issues which can be quite a daunting thing to watch especially the 90-minute Saturday omnibus editionOver on EastEnders 17.65 millionthe misery lingers on and onMorose Michell wins the wet blanket awardDroning Dot and nurdish Nigel do have the odd laughbut there's never been a character who you could call easy going and game for a laughBack over on Emmerdale 9.64 milliononly the ducks have gone quackersAmosSeth and Mr Wilks used to be like the Yorkshire version of Three Stoogesbut now it's all arguments and impending family feudsPathos rules and Seth is just sillyHome and Away 12.32 millionand Neighbours 13.69 millionare simply a different culture but at least there's plenty of sunshineAnd finally Eldorado 6.39 millionThis ill-fated soap is rising despite the fact that it ends in JulyWhat a pity there wasn't a stronger launch with some modern day clowns in there to offer funfrolics and festivityWelcome relief Sadlywhile we have plots focusing on homelessnessdrug abuse and adultery in the 90s dominating our regular visits to soap land it would be a welcome relief to have the odd outburst of laughterSoaps shouldn't take themselves so seriouslyWHAT do you thinkARE Soaps just right or do you think we need more funWRITE to Couch PotatoLiverpool Echo

Penny KileyHALF WAY through the play you will have seen a walking tableseveral fast opening doorsthe rapid interchanging of numerous couplesand a hotel foyer that is busier than Piccadilly Circus and has more familiar faces than your family treeGeorges Feydeau's turn of the century French farce is a classic of its kind and this production brings it to funnyfrantic lifeThis kind of action needs precise timing and director Mike Alfreds and his 14 strong cast provide the elegantly energetic execution requiredIt all starts when Parisienne wife Raymonde Susie Blakesuspects her husband Victor Emmanuel Colin McCormackof having an affairMistakenHe is actually one of the few men around who is not obsessed by faithlessnessShe sets a trap and sets off a series of events that entangle householdfamily and friendsThe play has some inventive touchesThere is a servant mistaken for a mastera wife mistaken for a mistressa deliberately revolving invalid and a reluctantly revolving hotel proprietorThen there are the lost continentsOne characterCamillecannot pronounce them until he is fitted with a false palate one more object to get comically lostIt may not be politically correct to laugh at speech impediments but Simon Roberts' excitable characterisation gets some of the biggest laughsAnd with or without his full quota of words he makes as much noise as anyone in what is a rather riotous productionAdding to the energy level is Colin McCormack doubling at deceptive speed as two mistaken charactersHe is almost a one man optical illusionThe rest of the cast is equally enthusiastic in this exuberant productionKing-size facelift for historic fortressLiverpool Castle set toBy Peter McBride Daily Post CorrespondentA RUINED castle is to be rebuilt750 years after the first brick of its historic predecessor was laid on the banks of the River MerseyThe rundown remains of Liverpool Castle a replica of King John's famous fortress have received a Â£40,000 cash boostRestoration work is scheduled for completion this August when the newcastle will be opened to the publicThe project marks the fulfilment of a dream which was held by one of the city's legendary entrepreneursthe late Lord Leverhulmewho started building work on the replica castle in 1912Work was never completed and when the wealthy founder of the Port Sunlight-based Lever Brothers died in 1925 the project remained unfinishedSince then the replica castle has fallen prey to vandalism and decaySituated on the shores of Rivington Reservoirnear Wiganit is now owned by North West WaterIt represents an important piece of both Liverpool's and Rivington's historysaid North West Water project manager Phil LuffOur first priority is to make the castle structurally sound and safe by securing the stone work and clearing away the rubbleThen we will rebuild parts of the castle walls and clean off the graffitiWhen the work is completed the public will have access to the castle once morejust as Lord Leverhulme intended 80 years agoThe wealthy Liverpool businessman never intended to rebuild the complete castlebut to recreate the ruined remains as they were in Liverpool before demolition in 1725The original fortress was built during King John's reign on the present-day site of Castle Street in the city centreAn estimated 750,000 people are expected to visit Liverpool Castle over the next 12 monthsThe renovation forms part of an Â£80,000 cash package to help boost the numbers of visitors to the Rivington estateHistory in the making Phil Luff surveys the ruins of Liverpool CastleDriving

awardHaydn Reesformer chief executive of Clwyd County Councilis one of four nominees for a special award in the annual Arts Council and British Gas Working for Cities AwardHis nomination is for work in using the arts to encourage economic investment in North East WalesDespite a barrage of criticism Mr Rees pressed ahead with plans for Theatr Clwyd in Mold and in 1976 it was opened by the QueenWhen British Steel closed its Shotton works with the loss of 8,500 jobsMr Rees became chairman of Deeside Enterprise Trust charged with the responsibility of creating new jobsBy the time he retired from his post eight years later 8,000 new jobs had been created and he believes the artistic opportunities presented by Theatr Clwyd played its partInternational companies in particular were impressed as they did not want to move their top people into a cultural desertTheatr Clwyd was a turning point on many occasions and is still an important factor when attracting new industrysaid Mr Reeswho lives in MoldThe winner of the special award will be announced in London on June 8I was very surprised to be nominated but very honouredsaid Mr Reesrecently retired chairman of the North Wales
