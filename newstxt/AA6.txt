A Country DiaryOXFORDSHIREOn the first morning of this monthwhilst watching the usual passage of gulls to the local refuse-dumpI spotted a flock of wadersestimated at between 300 and 400much higher up and heading due southanda matter of seconds latera similar party followed them on the same courseand I was able to identify them as Golden PloverSince this line of flight would take them straight to the pioneer party of 200-300 already assembled on the traditional Witney siteI wondered whether this was their destinationA few days laterimmediately alongside the busy M40a pause at traffic-lights enabled me to glance at a dense assembly of birdsas closely-packed as starlingsextending for almost a quarter of a mile along the edge of the arable fieldand I was able to identify them as a mixture of Lapwing and goldiesall immobileand many of the latter with their heads tucked in as if fast asleepAn estimate of numbers was impossible in the few seconds available at the pausebut on the return journeyabout an hour latersomething had awakened them and a most spectacular aerial display was in progress the two species had reacted differently to whatever had disturbed their siesta the lapwing wheeling erratically just above ground levelbut the goldiesin ever-changing smoke-like clouds high aboveperforming quick-change evolutions reminiscent of starlings going to roostAgainan estimate of numbers was difficultbut I am confident that there were well over 1,000 of the goldiesand almost as many lapwingW. D. CAMPBELLDear SantaI'd like a piana or some leggo Old Red Cheeks gets snowed under every year with letters from childrenSometimes the spelling isn't so hot but beliefas Melanie McFadyean foundstill seems to burn brightSANTA CLAUS probably got more letters than the Queen or Margaret Thatcher this yearBut then he's cuddlierThe Post Officewho handle his mailsay there were 600,000 letters for the plumpred-cheeked old fellowNaturally he couldn't answer them all himselfso Post Office staff lent a hand and every kid who wrote to him got a replypostmarked Reindeerland or SantalandWhether they get the computer softwaredolls and musical instruments they asked him for remains to be seenIt depends how much the adults collude and what their bank balances are looking likeIf 600,000 write to Santait follows that a great many children believe in himBut one child I know caught his parents prowling around with stockings at the dead of night and is now impressing upon his little pals that the whole thing is a conBut his parents continue to leave sherry and mince pies out for Old Red Cheeks perhaps they believe in himLots of parentsand the odd nanny or twoprovide back-up references for Santa explaining that little so-and-so is really a very good childThese good children who wrote to Santa this yearand their parents and nanniesdon't seem keen to continue the tradition of leaving sherry outThey're OK about the mince piesbut Santa is likely to drown in milk this yearPerhaps it's part of the drink/driving campaign reaching people who ride the sky in a sleigh drawn by reindeerAs for the reindeerone thoughtful child added a PSsaying she would make sure there were carrots and water for themAfter stuffing himself on mince pies and quaffing all that milkand getting even tubbierit's surprising that Santa can carry all the things the 600,000 ask him forAnd even more amazing that he can still squeeze through chimneys and central heating air vents in tower blocksMost kids have a pretty long listPlease may I have a Barbie doll with her van and a oops a daisy doll hands down games bensing babys teddy bears leggo my dolley suprise hungry hippoesSome of these kids start youngOne three-month-old baby managed to talk its parents into sending Santa a letter asking for some clothes and a few bits for the cotOne nine-year-old got most of the Christmas myth and the consumer dream into her letter as well as showing some concernDear Santahow are you doingI can not wait until Christmas come up and we have funOn Christmas Eve I said Christ was born many years ago tonightI'd like a piana from you for Christmas or if you can not get me that I would like a bikeHow is your wifeI will leave you some Christmas cake sweets and beerThe beer should cheer Santa up after all that milkBut let's hope the piana is only an uprightit would be a shame if the child who wants an organ has to go without and it's hard to see how Santa would manage with a Steinway grandIn New Yorkletters to Santa reflect the need more than the greed in that city of citiesA 10-year-old asks for shoesRight now my mother doesn't workHer mother has two other little kids and is on welfare $231 about £l44a monthA 50-year-old grandmother wrote to SantaI'm a sick lady with cancerI'm always with pain in the bodyI like a Quilt so I could be warm at nightThe letters are pinned up in a big main post office and generous people send the presentsLast year the Post Office in Britain answered one such requestgiving a wheelchair to seven-year-old Trudy Heenan's grandfatherA quick straw poll of parents revealed that the little children are thrilled to get their letters marked Santaland or Reindeerlandand believe that Santa really does come down the chimney while they're asleepThey believe it even though the evidence is suspectsuch is the charmed life of the childBut what about the uneaten mince piesOh we just take a bite or two out of themsay the parentsPresumably they pick up the pinta and down the sherry and beer as wellnot to mention making it look as if the reindeers have had a go at the carrotsNext year some clever dick will take a patent out on sets of replica reindeer teeth to clamp around the carrotsThe prize goes to a childage unspecified but a couple of years off joined-up writingwho saysDear Father Chismas can I have some of these thingsThe letter consists mostly of a complicated table of page and reference numbers with pricesThese refer to the Argos cataloguea big hit with the under-5s I'm reliably informedThe total cost of the numbered items from the catalogue is £156.63Let's hope Santa isn't too strapped for cash as a result of the interest rate because he also has to get Silvanian fire placessewing machinesSindy sicdollsgunskitchen setsguitarsbooksa baby
