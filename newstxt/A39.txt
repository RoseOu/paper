collecting should evolve into but seldom doesOne of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Cardwhose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equalAs honorary archivist for Lucasthe motor components grouphe begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives including Lucas family albums whenduring company restructuring two years agothe entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage TrustCompany archives are not that difficult to findThey tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeoversExpanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and atticsI paid a Hackney second-hand dealer £100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitorsThey include the entire recordswith a letters filecharting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian

the blue-chip art marketBy EDWARD LUCIE-SMITHMany column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary paintingVery little has been said about the boom in modern printsIn some ways this boom is even more extraordinarybecause it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of artPeter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in Londonwhich specialises in material of this kindexplained some of the rules of the print marketA print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth moneyIt is more like actual currencyThe reason is that while it may be in limited supplyit isn't uniqueWhen otheridentical examples existit is easy to establish what the value should beIt is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes upNot every printor every print-makeris suitable for the purposehoweverThe blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of namesThere are certain artists of the old Ecole de ParisMatissePicassoMiroChagallRouaultThere are certain contemporary American artistsJasper JohnsFrank StellaJim DineSam FrancisThere are also two British artistsHenry Moore and David HockneyWhat are the rules of admission to the pantheonFirstthe artist has to be a major nameSecondhe has to be a prolific print-makerand the prints themselvesthough perhaps individually raremust collectively be in reasonably good supplyThirdthe prints must form an integral part of the artist's career that isour appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this fieldAll of these are fairly obviousBut there are two otherless obvious laws as wellPrintsto be valuablemust be good impressions on good quality paperEdvard Munchwhom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the centuryfails to qualify as blue-chipdespite occasional high prices at auctionbecause he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best qualityThe final qualification is that a print-makerto reach the very top of the treemust be known and appreciated by the JapaneseThe Berkeley Square Galleryfor examplemaintains a second outlet in Tokyoas a vital part of its operationsJapanese collectors find it easy to appreciate printsbecause works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritageThey do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious indeed axiomatic to EuropeansThey are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists Hokusaifor instanceand Hiroshige made print-making a primary creating mediumJapanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thingThe way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese tasteThe first generation of collectors was very conservativesaid Mr OsborneThey tended to like what was soft-edged and prettyAs a result of thiscertain big Renoir prints are expensive over £20,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawingThis makes a striking contrast with Manetwhose printsthough rareare modest in scale and not found in signednumbered editionsThe Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita After Velazquezfor only £1,250But now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much strongermore colourful thingssuch as prints by MiroSomething they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successorsthe artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and GroszOccasionallythey take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationallyAn example is the American Carol Summerswho makes superbcoloured woodcutsWhat they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcutstoo and superb qualityHow much do real blue-chip prints tend to costThis is fairly easy to answerbut only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward againA recent major commercial show of Miro's workfor exampletook all his prices to a new highA big coloured imagesuch as the aptly named Le Samouraiwill now cost £25,000Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more up to £45,000So do major prints by Sam Francis who lived and worked for a while in JapanThe benchmark here is over £50,000Matisse and Picassowho form the backbone of the market in classic modernprintsbring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractivenessA beautiful odalisque by Matissesuch as Torso with a Jugtypical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930swill bring £35,000 or moreImages from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suitewhich dates from the early 1930sbring between £8,000 and £12,000 plus but thesethough easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical styleare not coloured and were published in a fairly big editionThe established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is HockneyImages from the mid-1970s large prints of swimming poolsvases of flowers and interiors all niceneutral subjectswere till recently anchored at around £15,000In recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platformToday£20,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to £30,000Obviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gildedBut what about the long-term futureOne problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipelineready to join what is now a severely restricted groupThe Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basisOne answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist printsand those by the Nabisboth of which are beginning to seem undervaluedin comparison with what was produced by their successorsYou can get a fine Bonnard print for £2,500a Pissarro for less than £7,000Signacwho continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World Waruses the graphic medium superblyA tip-top specimen costs £10,000Even Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervaluedin terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performingMove over HockneyUncle Paul is behind youIf this is the way things gothere would be a certain art-historical justice in it
