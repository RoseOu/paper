The Northern EchoDOWN the swamp at Darlingtonsomething is stirringIt's the conservation volunteersOn a bright February morning they're up to their wellied ankles in mud and waterturning a formerly ignored site on the edge of heavy industry into a nature havenUp to nowthe patch of land off Whessoe Road hasn't had a great deal going for itIt backs onto a couple of euphemismsthe Civic Amenity Site and the abattoir and a valuable pond which attracted migrating birds has regularly dried up in the summerThe British Trust for Conservation Volunteers have already achieved much to improve the site's appealThey have taken steps to stop water draining off from the mini-lakeand done an inordinate amount of plodging in the wetlandWe're trying to increase the amount of aquatic habitat herewhich includes planting reed mace and building dykessays Dean Hewardwho is organising the project for BTCVThe project is what you might call labour-intensiveWheelbarrows of mud are carted from one site to help form a containing mound for a pond at the other endThe land is owned by Darlington Councilwho are funding the conservation workHelpers have included pupils from an adjacent schooland also handicapped volunteersThe site will have wildlife-friendly hedges of blackthornhawthornsweet briar and dog roseand three wedges of young trees will provide shelter to pond usersWe've planted 4000 trees including aspensilver and downy birch and rowansays DeanThe water is used at the moment by passing migratory birdsbut hopefully once the cover grows up a little they will be encouraged to stop hereThe volunteers started work by hauling away an accumulation of rubbish which had found its way into the little lakeDumped cars have also been an occasional problemBut even in the middle of industrythe Darlington site has attracted wildlifeRabbits live in the surrounding areaand a kestrel has been spotted nearbyThe BTCV manages several sites in County Durhamall relying on the hard work of volunteersWork at Whessoe Road will go on right through the summerWe want to create a wildflower meadowbut it's important to see what's already here before we go ahead and plantsays DeanSo we'll keep the long stuff down over the season and see what flowers come upThe volunteers are about to start recycling in an unusual wayThere's a job coming up in Easington where the Middlesbrough group is clearing a dyke system of the sort we are trying to create hereSo we are going to bring all the plants that they don't want over here more rushes and sedges and aquatic plants to diversify the habitatThe British Trust for Conservation is looking for more volunteersRing  for detailsSANDPIPERsmallmigratory wader that by way of a good nosh up pecks insects and other invertebrates from the

the place is busyand deservedlybut its attractions may be a sum of parts rather than the outstanding appeal of the foodThe unadventurous menu is a mix of home made like creamy vegetable soupor

Teesside Development Corporation's regeneration of the lower Tees and its estuaryIt will be the largest man-made nature reserve in the United Kingdomdesigned to provide ideal conditions in which birdsfish and wild plants will thriveAnd the National Rivers Authority has pledged to introduce 200,000 salmon a year for the next four years into the cleaned-up River Tees the first time the fish have been in the river in any numbers in the last 30 yearsThe multi-million scheme was announced on Monday this week by Environment Secretary Michael Heseltinebacked by his Minister of StateDavid

coursesis sitedAlsoTeesdalewith its views of the revitalised Teeswill be an appropriate home to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution from May this yearThe new nature reserve will be the area of Middlesbrough and more than seven times the size of Hyde ParkIt will create new natural habitats in reedbedsgrasslandsswampsaltmarshwater and woodlandsAnd this priceless asset would qualify for United Nations recognition as an International Biosphere ReserveSituated on the Tees estuarythe area is already an internationally-famous Ramscar class wetland refuge for birdswaders and wildfowlIt attracts significant numbers of species including the shelducksanderlingredshank and grey ploverIts importance will grow as the reserve takes shape and provides even more of the right habitats for wildlife and wild plantsThe International Nature Reserve is for the benefit of the Teesside community and beyondIt has been carefully designed to develop and protect wildlife and plants while attracting many thousands of visitorsIt has taken the best elements from several Dutch schemes the Dutch being recognised as the experts in creating wetland nature reservesThe launch of the 2,500-acre nature reserve

with the major initiativesthe local councilsorganisations such as the Wildlife Trust and the community are working towards a new environmentWhen the people come togetherthe most ambitious projects are achievableSir David Attenborough saidCompanies of local and national importance on Teesside recognise their environmental responsibilitiesThey prove that industry and nature can coexistAnd ICI chairman Sir Denys Henderson addedI am proud of ICI's conservation record on TeessideOur successful partnership there serves as a powerful example of what can be achieved by industry working together with conservationists and local communitiesFur factsFURTHER to your piece on the leopard trade ban Echo March 7it appears you took the trouble to consult the views of LynxWe did not have the pleasure of hearing from you and it showsThe African leopard was never in danger of extinction throughout its rangeA voluntary ban was imposed by the London trade in order to give stocks breathing and breeding spaceIt is significant that it is the Africans who are pressing for a partial lifting of the ban and the maligned fur trade has made no move in that directionIt is the money-making of animal rights organisations which science threatensnot animal welfareMike AllanSpokesmanFur Education CouncilPO Box 1EWLondon W1A 1EWIT will doubtless be cataclysmic to learn that out is the last place cats should be at nightFar from spending long hours on the tiles huntingscavenging and generally having a high old time with their palsas tradition and practice dictatethey should be indoors tucked upThis information has been relayed in this direction by the Cats Protection LeagueIt is not that cats do not enjoy all the aforementioned nocturnal pleasuresit is that nightlife is too dangerous for themTo this end the CPL has won a little victory in its efforts to ensure that the cat is not put out with the milk bottlesHaving espied precisely such a scene on a television advertisement for milkMarjorie Roberts of the CPL in Darlington wrote to the Milk Marketing BoardA reply has eventually arrived from the National Dairy CouncilThis makes the usual noises about the careful research which goes into making television advertisementsnot to mention the advice-seekingThis may be sobut the Cats Protection League was obviously not on the listBut the NDC has not merely turfed out the CPL's complaint with the milk and the catIt says that in the light of the observation it is now reviewing the commercialIf it is possiblewithin budgetsto amend the film it will do soThe budget gives them a get-out option but the CPL and Marjorie Roberts are grinning like Cheshire cats to have extracted such a promiseOf coursethey may have to write next to Hannah-Barbramakers of the cartoon series The
