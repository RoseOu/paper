reduction in North Sea taxes and is making additional cuts in capital spending to avoid the risks of further cash and dividend pressuresChairman Robert Horton disclosed the moves at yesterday's annual meeting where analysts felt the tone of his address to shareholders provided further indications that BP would hold its first quarter dividend in the face of bleak resultsBP has already made one unsuccessful attempt to make use of its £500m in surplus advanced corporation tax with a North Sea-based scheme that was vetoed by the TreasuryBut with tax payments to the Government last year of £755m eating into slim profitsMr Horton is to see Mr Lamont shortly to try to produce a change of mindBP is believed to be considering two approachesone based on a reduction in petroleum revenue tax that would raise the group's exposure to corporation tax but open the way for an advanced corporation tax offsetThe second is a variation a return a system abolished in 1986 where advanced corporation tax could be offset against production taxes inside the North Sea ring fenceBP and Shell account for a large slice of petroleum tax payments because they operate mature fields that have lost their tax shelterLast year BP paid £451m against £746m in 1990Mr Horton warned shareholders that there was no sign of immediate improvement in the business and said that oil prices could remain flat for some timeThe latest capital spending review could result in a near 20 p.c. cut in total investment to $6½ billion £3.7 billionagainst $8 billion £4.6 billionlast year although after allowing for the purchase of Petromed in Spain the figure is nearer 7 p.cCityAmerican trade gap reduced by 43pcBy Jonathan Confino in New YorkA SURGE in American exports to record levels was responsible for a dramatic

major trading partners would slow the trendHoweverRobert Bruscachief economist at Nikko Securitiessaid February's figures were inflated by seasonal factors and are likely to prove to be temporaryHe

Olivetti groupwas sentenced yesterday to six years and four months in jail for his part in the fraudulent collapse of Roberto Calvi's Banco AmbrosianoThe bank crashed in 1982 with debts of more than $1 billionseven months after Mr de Benedetti resigned as vice-chairmanHe had been in office for only 65 daysending in January 1981The Milan court held Mr de Benedetti had profited unfairly by receiving a £20m share package in an Ambrosiano subsidiaryas well as the 2 p.c. share value in the bank which he sold at the end of his tenureMr Calvi was found hanging below London's Blackfriars Bridge in 1982 with 10 pounds of bricks in his pocketstwo months before the crash in which 39,000 small investors lost their savingsAccording toMozzarellaMannoiaa Mafia informerMr Calvi was murdered

continue as chairman and chief executive of OlivettiCity CommentThere's spring in the step of the stock marketAT LEAST last Friday's post-election stock market surge was not a one-day special offer for the professionals onlyPrices have remained high-indeed the FT-SE index has risen another 55 points since then allowing even the most passive of private investorsincluding unit trust holdersto take advantage of the marketThe 10 p.c. gain since election day is looking increasingly sustainableIt is not that prospects for earnings are 10 p.c. better that they were in the middle of last weekbut it is possible to argue that prospects are that much better than they would have been under a Labour government and that the market was discounting such a resultThe FT-SE failed to hold its gains yesterday but shortly after opening it was only six points away from last September's previous record closing levelWall Street has been hitting new peaks this week toowhich has given support to the London market and even Japan's Nikkei indexin a typically erratic periodhas gained nearly 800 points while London added its 245but London has real strengths of its ownThe City view is that the fall in corporate earnings has stopped and that next year's increase could be around 15 p.cThe market's price-earnings multiple was 16 last night but it would drop below 14 if that increase in earnings really happensThe increase will not be matched by dividend rises too many companies have been paying more than they could afford over the past two years and need to repair their reserves and ratios but 7 p.c. growth looks reasonableThe market yielda historic 4¾ p.c.could return back above 5 p.c.therefore giving basic-rate taxpayers a real return with the prospect of real growth tooNot all problems have gone away of courseyesterday's £6.4 billion public sector borrowing requirement is not much higher than expectationsbut it is almost as large as the deficit for the previous 11 months and with this year's deficit forecast to be double last year's shows why the Bank of England so eagerly sold £2 billion or more of gilts on election night and why it needs a regular stream of massive salesThe change in employment may not always be so favourable as yesterday's eitherbut the market is now starting to feel bullish and looking for a FT-SE of 3,000 by next yearCity CommentIndustry starts to advance on taxINDUSTRY is preparing for another assault on advance corporation taxBP fired the first salvo yesterday and chairman Robert Horton has arranged to see Chancellor Norman Lamont to try to assess the prospects for changeMr Lamont raised hopes in the Budget that the Treasury may be prepared to think again about giving companies access to the estimated £2 billion of unrelieved advance corporation tax waiting in their balance sheets for an offsetBut with the tax collectors anxious to get their hands on every ha'pennythe Chancellor cannot afford to be generousRecession has added to the howls of anguish traditionally generated by the issueThe slump in profits has limited the scope for corporation tax offsets but economic recovery should help ease the problemBP's case for a reduction in North Sea taxes to provide room for manoeuvre smacks of special pleadingIt is one of the few companies exposed to the full blast of petroleum revenue tax butas a recent National Audit Office report showedthe whole offshore tax system is in a messMr Lamont should deflect the BP attack and put the whole North Sea taxation house in orderGold's standard still flaggingLAST time gold's price was fixed at yesterday afternoon's level Prince Andrew and Lady Sarah Ferguson had just announced their engagementThe price is now back to the $336.70 an ounce which cut the cost of their wedding ring six years ago and nothing seems set to put the shine back on bullionWorld economic and political uncertainty once caused gold to twitch up like a kneecap tapped with a hammerNow Saddam

changed of courseEuropean currencies no longer fluctuate against each other and Russia and South Africa two great producing areas have found a political stability of sortsEven most of South America has conquered inflation and gold-loans have effectively smoothed the marketGold has been stripped of the magical investment properties once ascribed to the metalleaving it to the merciless forces of physical supply and physical demandOn the consumption sidethat means industrial usage which is hit by the recessionand to an even greater extentjewellery which is even harder hit by the recessionOn the other side of the equationthe producers show no strong wish to stop miningThe outlook is bleakWhen gold was last at this level in April 1986 Chernobyl was about to rumblethere are no encouraging noises in 1992City CommentEncouraging us to look awayNORMAN Lamont will be in good company at next week's IMF and G7 meetingsHe will be surrounded by finance ministers who have forecast the green-shoots of recovery but who have yet to see their crop flourishThe message they will tell the world is that recovery really is about to show but they will be conscious this is the message they broadcast last year tooPerhaps it is for that reason that Britain will find greater interest in discussing the problems of the former Soviet Union and in establishing the rouble stabilisation fundeven though it will mean us pledging about $600m to help keep the Reds out of the redEver since Mr Gorbachev attended our G7 meeting last year and Mr Lamont went to inspect the Russian chaosBritain has effectively adopted the Soviets and we will be pressing hardest to help even George Bush is now jumping on this bandwagonLike BritainMr Bush may find Russia a useful diversion from talking about a

idle on the forecourts of Britain's brick manufacturersSo the surprising feature of Ibstock Johnsen is that it continues to make any money at allProfits in 1991 dropped from £23.6m to £10½m before
